  7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   This report, written for the Anti -discrimination department of the  Council of Europe, concerns discrimination caused by  algorithmic decision -making and other types of artificial  intelligence (AI). AI advances important goals, such as  efficiency, health and economic growth  but it can also have  discriminatory effects, for instance when AI systems learn from  biased human decisions.   In the public and the private sector, organisations can take AI driven dec isions with far -reaching effects for people. Public  sector bodies can use AI for predictive policing  for example , or  for making decisions on eligibility for pension payments,  housing assistance or unemployment benefits. In the private  sector, AI can be use d to select job applicants , and banks can  use AI to decide whether to g rant individual consumers credit  and set interest rates for them. Moreover, many small decisions,  taken together, can have large effects. By way of  illustrat ion, AIdriven price discrim ination could lead to certain groups in  society consistently paying more.   The most relevant legal tools  to mitigate the risks of AI -driven  discrimination are non -discrimination law and data protection  law. If effectively enforced, both these legal tools  could help to  fight illegal discrimination. Council of Europe member States ,  human rights monitoring bodies, such as the European  Commission against Racism and Intolerance, and Equality  Bodies should aim for better enforcement of current non discrimination n orms.   But AI also opens the way for  new types of unfair differentiation  (some might say discrimination) that escape current laws. Most  non-discrimination statutes apply only to discrimination on the  basis of protected characteristics, such as skin colour.  Such  statutes do not apply if an AI system invents new classes, which  do not correlate with protected characteristics, to differentiate 
between people. Such differentiation could still be unfair,  however, for instance when it reinforces social inequality.    We probably need additional regulation to protect fairness and  human rights in the area of AI. But regulating AI in general is not  the right approach, as the use of AI systems is too varied for  one set of rules. In different sectors, different values are  at  stake, and different problems arise. Therefore, sector -specific  rules should be considered. More research and debate are  needed.  
  9 I. INTRODUCTION   This report , written for the Anti-discrimination department of the  Council of Europe, concerns  risks of discrimination caused by  algorithmic decision -making  and other types of artificial  intelligence (AI) .   AI advance s important goals, such as efficiency, health  and  economic growth. Our society relies on AI for many thing s,  including spam filtering, traffic planning, logistics management,  speech recognition, and diagnosing diseases. AI and  algorithmic decision -making may appear to be  rational, neutral  and unbiased  but, unfortunately, AI and algorithmic decision making  can also lead to unfair and illegal discrimination. As  requested , the report focuses on the following questions.   1.  In which fields do algorithmic decision -making and other  types of AI create discriminatory effects, or could create  them in the foreseeable future?   2.  What regulatory  safeguards (including redress  mechanisms ) regarding AI currently exist , and which  safeguards are currently being considered?    3.  What recommendations  can be made about mitigating  the risks of discriminatory AI, to organisations using AI,  to Equality Bodies  in Council of Europe member states,  and to human rights monitoring bodies, such as the  European Commission against Racism and  Intolerance ?   4.  Which types  of action (legal, regulatory, self -regulatory)  can reduce risks?     This report uses the word "discrimination " to refer to  objectionable or  illegal discrimination, for instance on the basis  of gender, skin colour, or racial origin .1 The report speaks of                                                      1 In line with legal tradition, I use the words "racial origin" and "race" in this report. However, I  do not accept theories that claim that there are separate human races.  
10 "differentiation " when referring to discrimination in a neutral,  unobjectionable, sense.2   This report focuses on only one risk in relation to  algorithmic  decision -making and AI: the risk of discrimination. Many AI related topics are thus o utside the scope of this report, such as   automated weapon systems , self-driving cars , filter bubbles ,  singularity , data-driven monopolies , the risk that AI or robots  cause mass  unemployment. Also out  of scope are privacy related questions regarding the mas sive amounts of personal  data that are collected to power AI -systems.    The report relies on literature review. Because of length  constraints, this report should be seen as a quick scan, rather  than an in -depth m apping of all relevant aspects of AI ,  algorit hmic decision -making,  and discrimination. I would like to  thank Bodó Balázs, Janneke Gerards, Dick Houtzager, Margot  Kaminski, Dariusz Kloza, Gianclaudio Malgieri, Stefan Kulk,  Linnet Taylor, Michael Veale, Sandra Wachter  and Bendert  Zevenbergen  for their valuable suggestions.   The remainder of the report is structured as follows. Chapter  II  introduces artificial intelligence, algorithmic decision -making ,  and some other key phrases. Next, the report discusses  the  above -mentioned questions. Chapter  III maps fields where AI  leads  or might lead to  discriminat ion. Chapter  IV discusses  regulatory safeguards. Chapter  V highlights how organisations  can prevent discrimination when using AI. The chapter also   offers recommendations to Equality Bodies and hum an rights  monitoring bodies  on mitigating the risks of discriminatory AI  and algorithmic decision -making . Chapter  VI gives suggestions   on improving regulation , and chapter VII provides concluding  thoughts.                                                        2 The purpose of algorithmic decision -making is often to discriminate (in the sense of  differentiate or distinguish) between individuals or entities. See in detail the different meanings  of "discrimination": Lippert -Rasmussen 2014.  
11 II. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND   ALGORITHM IC DECISION -MAKING   The phrases AI and algorithmic decision -making are used in  various ways, and there is no consens us about definitions.  Below artificial intelligence (AI), algorithmic decision -making  and some related concepts  are briefly introduced .   Algorit hm  An algorithm can be described as  "an abstract, formali sed  description of a computational procedure. "3 In this report,  "decision " simply refers to the output, finding, or outcome of that  procedure. As a rough rule of thumb, one could think of an  algorithm as a computer program.   Some times, an algorithm decides in a fully automatic  fashion.  For instance, a s pam filter for an e -mail s ervice  can filter out ,  fully automatically,  spam  messages fr om the user ’s inbox.  Sometimes, humans make decisions assisted by algorithms;  such decisions are partly  automatic . For example , based on an  assessment of a customer ’s credit by an AI system, a bank  employee may decide whether a customer can borrow money  from the bank .  However, when discussing discrimination, many risks are  similar for fully and partly automated decisions.  Recommendations by computers may have an air of rationality  or infallibili ty, and people  might blindly follow them . As Wagner  et al. note, "the human being may often be led to "rubber stamp "  an algorithmically prepared decision, not having the time,  context or skills to make an adequate decision in the individual  case. "4 Human decisio n-makers may also try to minimis e their  own responsibility by following the computer ’s advice.5 The  tendency to believe computers or to follow their advice is                                                      3 Dourish 2016, p. 3.

12 sometimes called  "automation bias ".6 (We see in section IV.2  that some legal rules do dist inguish fully and partly automated  decisions.7)  Artificial intelligence   Artificial intelligence (AI) is, loosely speaking , "the s cience of  making machines smart ".8 More formally, AI  concerns  "the  study of the design of intelligent agents. "9 In this context, an  agent is "something that acts ", such as a computer.10   AI is a broad research field, which  exists since the 19 40s.11  There are m any types of AI. For instance, in the 1970s and  1980s, there was much  research into "expert systems ",  "programs for reconstructing the expertise and reasoning  capabilities of qualified specialists within limited domains. "12  Researchers program med computers to answer questions,  using preformulated answers.  Such expert systems had some   commercial success in th e 1980s.13 Expert systems had two  disadvantages, observes  Alpaydin. First, the logical rules in the  systems did not always fit the messy reality of the wor ld. "In real  life, things are not true or false, but have grades of truth: a  person is not either old or not old, but oldness increases  gradually with age. "14 Second, experts had to provide the                                                      6 Parasuraman and Manzey 2010.

13 knowledge (the answers) to put into the systems . That process  costs a lot of time and money .15   Machine learning   In the past decade , one type of AI has been particularly   successful: machine learning.16 With machine  learning, the  knowledge in the system does not have to be provided by  experts. "In contrast, machine learning systems are set a task  and given a large amount of data to use as examples of how  this ta sk can be achieved or from which to detect patterns. The  system then learns how best to achieve the desired output. "17   As a rough rule of thumb, machine learning could be  summarised as "data-driven predictions ".18 Lerh and Ohm give  a more detail ed descripti on: "machine learning refers to an  automated process of discovering correlations (sometimes  alternatively referred to as relationships or patterns) between  variables in a dataset, often to make predictions or estimates of  some outcome. "19  Machine learning h as become widely used during  the past  decade , in part because more and more data have become  available to train the machines. Machine learning is so  successful that nowadays many people say AI when they refer  to machine learning  (which is a type of AI) .20   Related phrases are data mining, big data and profiling. Data  mining, a type of machine learning , is "the process of  discovering interesting patterns from massive amounts of                                                      15 Alpaydin 2016, p. 51.   16 Alpaydin 2016, p. 51. p. xiii.   17 Royal Society 2017, p. 19.   18 Paul, Jolley, and Anthony 2018, p. 6.    19 Lehr and Ohm 2017, p. 671.

14 data. "21 Data mining is also referred to as "knowledge discovery  from data ".22 The p hrase "big data " roughly refers to analysing  large data sets.23 "Profiling " involves automated data  processing to develop profiles that can be used to make  decisions about people.24  Terminology in this report   Regarding technology, t his report sacrifices precision  for  readability , and  uses "AI", "AI system ", "AI decision " etc, without  specifying whether AI refers to  machine learning or another  technology. Thus, in this report, an "AI system " can refer, for  instance, to a computer running  an algorithm that was fed data  by its human operators.   For ease of reading, this report uses phrases such as "effects  of AI", almost as if AI is an entity that acts on its own. However,   AI systems do not spontaneously come into existence. As  Wagner et al. note, "Mathematic or computational constructs do  not by themselves have adverse human rights impacts but their  implementation and application to human interaction does. "25  Indeed, when an AI system makes decisions, it was an  organisation  that decided to use AI for that  task.   In practice, an organisation that starts using AI rarely makes all  relevant decisions about the AI system itself. An organisation  might deploy an AI system, for which many important choices  have been made already.26 In some  cases, the effects of certain  decisions in a pre -procurement or design stage of an AI system                                                      21 Han, Pei, and Kamber 2011, p. 33. See also Frawley et al. 1992, who describe data mining  as "the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information  from data."   22 Han, Pei, and Kamber 2011, p. xxiii. Some see data mining as one step in the "knowledge  discovery" process.   23 Boyd and Crawford 2012.   24 See Hildebrandt 2008; Ferraris et al. 2013.   25 Wagner et al 2018, p. 8. See also: Dommering 2006; Rie ke, Bogen and Robinson 2018, p.  5.   26 See, on the way that modern digital systems are developed: Gürses and Van Hoboken 2017.  They focus on privacy, but their analysis is also relevant for AI systems and discrimination.  
15 may only become apparent when  the system  is deployed in the  real world. Apart from that, organisations can consist of many  people, such as managers, lawyers and I T specialists.  Nevertheless, f or brevity, the report sometimes says that  "organisations " do things. The next chapter  discusses how AI  can lead to discrimination and highlights areas where AI leads  or might lead to discriminatory effects.   III. DISCRIMINA TION RISKS   In which fields do algorithmic decision -making and other  types of AI create discriminatory effects, or could create  them in the foreseeable future?   1. HOW AI CAN LEAD TO DISCRIMINATI ON  This section discusses how AI can lead to discrimination; the  next section gives examples where AI has led, or might lead, to  discrimination.  AI systems are  often "black boxes ".27 It is often  unclear for somebody  why a system makes a certain decision  about him or her. Because of the opaqueness of such decisions,  it is difficult for people to assess whether they were  discriminated against on the basis of, for instance, racial origin.   AI-driven  decision -making can lead to discrimination in several  ways. In a seminal paper, Barocas and Selbst distinguish  five  ways  in which  AI decision -making  can lead , unintentionally,  to  discrimination.28 The problems relate to (i) how the "target  variable " and the "class labels " are defined; (ii) label ling the  training data; (iii) collecting the training data ; (iv) feature  selection; and ( v) proxies. In addition, (vi), AI systems can be  used , on purpose,  for discriminatory ends.29 We discuss each  problem  in turn.   1)  Defining the "target variable " and "class labels "                                                        27 Pasquale 2015.   28 Barocas and Selbst 2016. See also O’Neil 2016, who gives an accessible and well -written  introduction to discrimination and other risks in the area of AI systems.   29 Barocas and Selbst 2016. They group the ways slightly differently.  
16 AI involves computers that find correlations in data sets. For  instance, when a company develops a spam filter, the company  feeds the computer e -mail messages that are labelled by  humans as "spam " and "non-spam ". Those  labelled messages  are the training data. The computer finds  which characteristics  of e-mail messages correlate with being labelled as spam.  The  set of discovered correlations is often called "model " or  "predictive model ". For instance, messages that are l abelled as  spam might often contain certain phrases ( "magic weight loss  pill", "millions of dollars for you " etc), or might be sent from  certain IP addresses.  As Barocas and Selbst put it, "by exposing  so-called "machine learning " algorithms to examples of the  cases of interest (previously identified instances of fraud, spam,  default, and poor health), the algorithm "learns " which related  attributes or activities can serve as potential proxies for those  qualities or outcomes of int erest. "30 Such an outcome of interes t  is called a "target variable ".   "While the target variable defines what data miners are looking  for", explain Barocas and Selbst, "'class labels ' divide all  possible values of the target variable into mutually exclusive   categories. "31 For spam filtering, people roughly agree about  the class labels: which messages are spam or not.32 But for  some situations, it is less obvious what the target variable   should be. "Sometimes, " note Barocas and Selbst, "defining the  target variable involves the creation of new classes. "33 Suppose  a company wants an AI system  to sort job applications to find  good employees. How is a "good " employee  to be define d? In  other words: what should be the "class labels "? Is a good  employee one who sells the most products? Or one who is  never late at work?                                                       30 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 678.   31 Barocas and Selbs t 2016, p. 678.   32 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 678 -679, internal citations omitted.   33 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 679.  
17 Some target variables  and class labels , explain Barocas and  Selbst, "may have a greater or lesser adverse impact on  protected classes. "34 Suppose, for instance, that poorer people  rarely live in the city centre and must travel further to their work  than other employees. Therefore, poorer  people are late for  work more often than others  because of traffic jams or problems  with public transport . The company could choose "rarely being  late often " as a class label  to asses s whether an employee is  "good ". But if people with an immigrant background are, on  average, poorer and live further from their work, that choice of  class label would put people with an immigrant background at a  disadva ntage, even if they outperform other employees in other  aspects.35 In sum, discrimination  can creep into an AI  system  because of how an organisation defines the target variables and  class labels.   2) The training data : labelling examples   AI decision -making  can also have discriminatory results if the  system "learns " from discriminatory training data. Barocas and  Selbst describe two ways in which biased training data can have  discriminatory effects. First, the AI system might be trained on  biased data. Second, problems may arise when the AI system  learns from a biased sample.36 In both case s, the AI system  will  reproduce that bias.                                                         34 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 680.   35 See Peck 2013.     36 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 680 -681.  
18 The training data can be biased because they represent  discriminatory human decisions. Such a situation occurred at a  medical school in the UK in the 1980s.37 The school received  many more applications than it could place. Therefore, the  school developed a computer program to help sort the  applications. The training data for the computer program were  the admission files from earli er years, when people  selected  which applicants could enter medical school. The training data  showed the computer program which characteristics (the input)  correlated with the desired output (being admitted to the med ical  school). And the computer reproduc ed that selection system.   It turned out that the computer program discriminated against  women and against people with an immigrant background.  Apparently , in the years that provided the training data, the  people  that selected the students were biased again st women  and people with an immigrant background. As the British  medical journal noted, "the program was not introducing new  bias but merely reflecting that already in the system. "38 In sum,  if the training data are biased, the AI system  risks reproduc ing  that bias.   3)  Training data: d ata collection   The sampling procedure can also  be biased. For instance, when  collecting data about crime, it could be the case that the police  stopped more people with an immigrant background  in the past .  As Lum and Isaac n ote, "If police focus attention on certain  ethnic groups and certain neighbourhoods, it is likely that police  records will systematically over -represent those groups and  neighbourhoods. "39   If an AI system is train ed on such a biased sample, it will learn  that people with an immigrant background are more likely to                                                      37 Lowry and Macpherson 1988; Barocas and  Selbst 2016, p. 682.   38 Lowry and Macpherson 1988.   39 Lum and Isaac 2016, p. 15.  
19 commit crime. Lum and Isaac note: "if biased data is used to  train these predictive models, the models will reproduce (…)  those same biases. "40  The effects of such a biased sample could even be ampl ified by  AI predictions . Suppose the police pay extra attention in a  neighbourhood with many immigrants, while that  neighbourhood has average crime levels . The police register  more crime in that neighbourhood than elsewhere . Because the  numbers show more crime is registered (and thus seems to  occur) in that neighbourhood, even more policemen are sent  there. This way, policing on the basis of crime statistics can  cause a feedback loop.41   To give another example: poor people may be under represented in a data set. This can be illustrated with Street  Bump , a smartphone application that use s features such as  GPS feeds to report road conditions to the city  council . The  Street Bump site explains: "Volunteers use the Street Bump  mobile app to collect road con dition data while they drive. The  data provides governments with real -time information to fix  problems and plan long -term investments. "42 If there are fewer  smartphone users among poor people than among wealthier  people, poor people are likely to be undercounted. The effect  could be that faulty roads in poor neighbourhoods are under represented in the dataset and therefore receive fewer  reparations. The Street Bump app was used in the city of  Boston, and that city aims to correct for such bias in data   collection.43 But the example illustrates how data collection  could inadvertently lead to a biased data set. To sum up: biased  training data can lead to biased AI systems.                                                       40 Lum and Isaac 2016, p. 15.   41 Lum and Isaac 2016, p. 16.

See also Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 685; Federal Trade Commission 2016,  p. 27.  
20 4)  Feature selection   A fourth  problem relates to the features (categories of data)  that  an organisation selects for its AI system. If an organisation  wants to use AI to predict something automatically, it needs to  simplify the world to be able to capture it in data.44 As Barocas  and Selbst note, an organisation must "make choices about  what attributes they observe and subsequently fold into their  analyses. "45  Suppose that an organisation wants to predict automatically  which job applicants will be good employee s. It is not possible,  or at least too costly, for an AI system to assess each job  applicant completely. An organisation  could focus, for instance,  on certain  features, or characteristics, of each job applicant.   By selecting certain features, the organisation might introduce  bias against certain groups. For example,  many employers in  the US look for people who studied at famous and expensive  universities. But it might be relatively rare for certain racial  groups  to study at those  expensive universities.  Therefore , it  may have discriminatory effects if an employer select s job  applicants on the basis of whether they studied a t a famous  university.46 In sum, organisations can cause discriminatory  effects by selecti ng the features that an AI system uses for  prediction.                                                            44 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 688.   45 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 688.   46 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 689.  
21 5)  Proxies   Another problem concerns proxies. Some data that are included  in the training set may correlate with protected characteristics.  As Barocas and Selbst point out, sometimes "criteria that are  genuinely relevant in making rational and well -informed  decisions also happen to serve as reliable p roxies for class  membership. "47  Suppose that a bank uses an AI system , trained on data  covering  the last twenty years, to predict which loan applicants  will have problems repaying the loan. The training data do not  contain information about protected charac teristics such as skin  colour. The AI system learns  that people from postal code F67075 were likely to default on their loans  and uses that  correlation to predict defaulting . Hence, the system uses what  is at first glance  a neutral criterion ( postcode ) to predict  defaulting on loans. But suppose that the postcode  correlate s  with racial origin.  In that case, if the bank act ed on the basis of  this prediction and denied  loans to the people in that postcode ,  the practice would harm people from a certain racial origin.    Barocas and Selbst explain that "[t]he problem stems from what  researchers call "redundant encodings ", cases in which  membership in a protected class happens to be encoded in  other data. This occurs when a particular piece o f data or certain  values for that piece of data are highly correlated with  membership in specific protected classes. "48   To illustrate : a dataset that does not contain explicit data about  people ’s sexual orientation can still give information about  people ’s sexual orientation. "Facebook friendships expose  sexual orientation ", found  a study from 2009. The study  "demonstrates a method for accurately predicting the sexual  orientation of Facebook users by analy sing friendship                                                      47 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 691.   48 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 692. See also Dwork et al 2012.  
22 associations (…). [T]he percentage of a given user ’s friends  who self –identify as gay male is strongly correlated with the  sexual orientation of that user. "49  The proxy problem is difficult to solve. Barocas and Selbst note:  "Computer scientists have been unsure how to deal with  redundant en codings in datasets. Simply withholding these  variables from the data mining exercise often removes criteria  that hold demonstrable and justifiable relevance to the decision  at hand. "50 Hence,  "[t]he only way to ensure that decisions do  not systematically d isadvantage members of protected classes  is to reduce the overall accuracy of all determinations. "51   6)  Intentional discrimination   Another situation can also occur: discrimination on purpose .52  For example, an organisation could intentionally  use proxies to  discriminate on the basis of racial origin. As Kroll et al. observe :  "A prejudiced decisionmaker could skew the training data or  pick proxies for protected classes with the intent of generating  discriminatory results ".53 When an organisation  uses proxies,  the discrimination would be harder to detect than when the  organisation openly discriminates.   To give a hypothetical example: an organisation could  discriminate against pregnant women, while that discrimination  would be difficult  to discove r. The US retail store Target   reportedly construct ed a "pregnancy prediction " score, based  on around 25  products, by analysing the shopping behaviour of  customers. If a woman buys some of those products, Target can  predict with reasonable accuracy that she  is pregnant. Target  wanted to reach people with advertising during moments in life                                                      49 Jernigan and Mistree 2009.   50 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 720.   51 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 721 -722.   52 Barocas and Selbst 2016, p. 692. See also Bryson 2017; Friedman and Nissenbaum 1996;  Hacker 2018, p. 1149; Kim 2017, p. 884; Vetzo, Gerards, and Nehmelman 2018, p. 145.   53 Kroll et al. 2016, p. 682.  
23 when they are more likely to ch ange  their shopping habits.  Therefore, Target wanted to know when female customers were  going to give birth. "We knew that if we could identify them in  their second trimester, there ’s a good chance we could capture  them for years ".54 Target used the prediction for targeted  marketing, but an organisation could also use such a prediction   for discrimination .55   To sum up, AI decision -making ca n lead to discrimination in  at  least six ways , which relate to  (i) the definition of the target  variables and the class label s; (ii) the labelling and (iii)  collecting  of the training data; (iv) the selection of the features; (v) proxies.  And (vi) organisa tions could use AI systems to discriminate on  purpose. AI can also lead to other types of unfair differentiation,  or to errors. We return to those topics in chapter VI.   2. FIELDS IN WHICH AI  BRING S DISCRIMINATION  RISKS   This section provides  examples of fields where AI decision making has led, or could lead, to  discrimination.    Police, crime prevention   We start with the public sector. A notorious  example of an AI  system with discriminatory effects is the system  known as   "Correctional Offender Manageme nt Profiling for Alternative  Sanctions " – COMPAS for short.56 The COMPAS system is  used in parts of the US to predict whether defendants will  commit crime again.  The idea is that COMPAS can help judges  to determine whether somebody should be allowed to go on  probation (supervision outside prison).  The COMPAS system  does not use racial or igin or skin colour as an input. But  research by Angwin et al. , investigative journalists at                                                      54 Duhigg 2012, quoting the statistician of Target. See o n the Target case also Siegel 2013,  Chapter 2.   55 See Kim 2017, p. 884.   56 See Equivant 2018.  
24 ProPublica , showed in 2016 that COMPAS is "biased against  blacks. "57 ProPublica  summarise s:   COMPAS (…)  correctly predicts recidivism  61 percent of the time. But blacks are almost  twice as likely as whites to be label led a  higher risk but not actually reoffend. It  makes the opposite mistake among whites:  They are much more likely than blacks to be  label led lower risk but go on to commit other  crimes .58   Moreover, "Black defendants were also twice as likely as white  defendants to be misclassified as being a higher risk of violent  recidivism. And white violent recidivists were 63 percent more  likely to have been misclassified as a low risk of violent  recidivism, compared with black violent recidivists. "59   Northpointe, the company behind COMPAS, dispute s that the  system is unfair.60 ProPublica  and Northpointe disagree mainly  on what standard  of fairness should be used to assess the  system.61 Academic statisticians have argued that , in some  cases, different standards of fairness are incompatible  mathematically, which has consequences for what  discrimination prevention should or could look like. ProPublica  was concerned about what can be called "disparate  mistreatment ", where differen t groups receive different error  types disproportionately ( for instance  individuals from some  groups having a higher possibility of being deemed high -risk  when they would not go on to commit a crime). Yet another                                                      57 Angwin et al 2016.   58 Angwin et al 2016.   59 Larson et al 2016.   60 This paragraph is largely written by Michael Veale.   61 The discussion about COMPAS between ProPu blica, Northpointe and academics is, in part,  rather technical. A good summary of the discussion is: Feller et al. 2016. See also A shared  statement of civil rights concerns 2018. See for the view of Northpointe: Dieterich, Mendoza  and Brennan 2016.  
25 important characteristic of risk scores is that they are correctly  "calibrated ". This means that for a group of individuals deemed  to have an 80% chance of going on to commit a crime, 80% of  that group indeed do go on to commit a crime. This should also  be the same within groups, such as within bla ck or white  defendants. If this were not the case, then judges would need  to interpret "high risk " for a black defendant differently than the  same "high risk " for a white defendant, which brings other  biases into play. Statisticians have indicated that whe re the  underlying propensity to recidivism does differ, it is  mathematically impossible to also have equalised error rates.62  Sometimes the police use AI systems for predictive policing:  automated predictions about who will commit crime, or when  and where c rime will occur.63  As noted above, predictive  policing systems can reproduce and even amplify existing  discrimination.   Selection of employees and students   In the private sector, AI can have discriminatory effects as well.  We saw , for instance,  that AI can be used to select prospective  employees or students. As the example of the medical school  in the UK showed, an AI system could lead to discrimination   because of biased training data . Reportedly, Amazon stopped  using an AI system for screening job ap plicants because the  system was biased against women. In the words of Reuters ,  "the company reali sed its new system was not rating candidates  for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a  gender -neutral way. "64 Based on historical training data ,  "Amazonʼs system taught itself that male candidates were  preferable. "65                                                       62 See Chouldechova 2017.   63 Hildebrandt 2014; Ferguson 2017; Perry et al 2013; Van Brakel and De Hert 2011.   64 Dastin 2018.   65 Dastin 2018.  
26 Advertising   AI is used for targeted online advertising, a very profitable sector  for some companies (Facebook and Google, both among the  world ’s most valuable companies, derive most of their profit  from online advertising66). Online advertising can have  discriminatory effects. Sweeney showed in 2013 that, when  people searched for African -American -sounding names,  Google displayed advertisements that suggested that  somebody had an arrest  record. For white -sounding names,  Google displayed fewer ads suggestive of arrest records.  Presumably, Google ’s AI system analysed people ’s surfing  behaviour and inherited a racial bias.67  Datta, Tschantz, and Datta simulated identical internet users  who s elf-declared as male or female in settings. The  researcher s then analysed the ads that Google presented.68  "Google showed the simulated males ads from a certain career  coaching agency that promised large salaries more frequently  than the simulated females, a finding suggestive of  discrimination. "69 Researchers note that it is unclear why  women were shown fewer ads for high -paying jobs, because of  the opaqueness of the system: "We cannot determine who  caused these findings due to our limited visibility into th e ad  ecosystem, which includes Google, advertisers, websites and  users. "70   This is an example where the opaqueness of AI systems makes  it harder to discover discrimination and its cause. People could  be discriminated against without being aware. If an AI s ystem                                                      66 Fortune 2018. The mother company of Google is officially called "Alphabet".   67 Sweeney 2013.   68 Datta, Tschantz and Datta  2015.   69 Datta, Tschantz and Datta 2015, p. 93.   70 Datta, Tschantz and Datta 2015, p. 92; Datta et al. 2018.  
27 target s job ads only at men, women might not realise that they  are excluded from the ad campaign.71  The Dutch Data Protection Authority found that Facebook  enabled advertisers to target people based on sensitive  characteristics. For instance, "data re lating to sexual  preferences were used to show targeted advertisements ".72 The  Data Protection Authority says that Facebook amended its  practices to make such targeting impossible.73 Angwin and  Perris , at ProPublica,  showed that "Facebook l ets advertisers  exclude users by race. Facebook ’s system allows advertisers to  exclude black, Hispanic and other "ethnic affinities " from seeing  ads."74 ProPublica also showed that some firms use Facebook ’s  targeting possibilities to advertise job ads only to people under  a certain age.75 Spanish researchers showed that "Facebook  labels 73% of EU users with sensitive interests ", such as  "Islam ", "reproductive health ", and "homosexuality ".76  Advertisers can target advertising on the basis of such interests.                                                          71 Munoz, Smith and Patil, 2016, p. 9; Zuiderveen Borgesius 2015a, chapter  3, section 3.    72 Dutch Data Protection Authority 2017; Dutch Data Prote ction Authority 2017a.   73 Dutch Data Protection Authority 2017.   74 Angwin and Perris 2016. See also Angwin, Tobin and Varner 2017. Dalenberg 2017  examines the application of EU non -discrimination law to ad targeting. In 2018, NGOs filed a  lawsuit in the USA  against Facebook for discrimination under US fair housing laws, for allowing  the exclusion of women, disabled veterans and single mothers from a housing advertisement’s  potential audience (Bagli 2018).   75 Angwin, Scheiber and Tobin 2017.   76 Cabañas, Cuevas and Cuevas 2018. Such interests are defined as "special categories" of  data, also called "sensitive data", in European data protection law. See article 9 of the European  Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. See, on data protection law: section  IV.2.  
28 Price discrimination   Online shops can differentiate the price for identical products  based on information the shop has about a consumer: a practice  called online price differentiation. A shop can recognise website  visitors, for instance through cookies, and cate gorise them as  price -sensitive or price -insensitive. With price differentiation,  shops aim  to charge each consumer the maximum price that he  or she is willing to pay.77   Princeton Review, a US company that offers online tutoring  services, charged different prices in different areas in the US,  ranging from 6600 to 8400 dollars. Presumably, the costs for  delivering the service were the same for each area, as the  company offers its tutoring service over the Internet . Angwin et  al. found that the company ’s price  differentiation practice led to  higher prices for people with an Asian background: "Customers  in areas with a high density of Asian residents were 1.8 times  as likely to be offered higher prices, regardless of income. "78  The company probably did not set ou t to discriminate on the  basis of racial origin. Perhaps the company had tested different  prices in different neighbourhoods and found that in certain  areas people bought the same amount of services, even for  higher prices. Nevertheless, the effect was tha t certain ethnic  groups paid more.   Image search and analysis   Systems to search for images can also have discriminatory  effects. In 2016, a search in Google Images for "three black  teenagers " led to mugshots, while a search for "three  white  kids" mostly lead to pictures of happy white kids. In response to  shocked reactions, Google said: "Our image search results are  a reflection of content from across the web, including the  frequency with which types of images appear and the way                                                      77 Zuiderveen Borgesius and Poort 2017.   78 Angwin, Mattu and Larson 2015; Larson, Mattu and Angwin 2015.  
29 they’re described online. (…) This means that sometimes  unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can  affect what image search results appear for a given query. "79  Indeed, one could say that Google ’s AI system merely reflected  society .80 But even if the fault lies with society rather than with  the AI system, those image search results could influence  people ’s beliefs.   Kay, Matuszek and Munson found that "image search results  for occupations slightly exaggerate gender stereotypes and  portray the minority gender for an occupation less  professionally. There is also a slight under -representation of  women. "81   A different type of problem concerns image recognition by AI  systems. Some image recognition software has difficulties in   recognising an d analysing non -white faces. Facial -tracking  software by Hewlett Packard did not recognise dark -coloured  faces as faces.82 And the Google Photos app labelled a picture  of an African -American couple as "gorillas ".83 A Nikon camera  kept asking people from an A sian background: "Did someone  blink? "84 An Asian man had his passport picture rejected,  automatically, because "subject ’s eyes are closed " – but his  eyes were open.85 Buolamwini and Gebru found that  "darker skinned females are the most misclassified group (w ith error  rates of up to 34.7%). The maximum error rate for lighter skinned males is 0.8%. "86 Perhaps some of the errors  mentioned above were the result of only training system s on  pictures of white men.                                                         79 Google’s reaction, quoted in York 2016.   80 Allen 2016.   81 Kay, Matuszek and Munson 2015.   82 Frucci 2009.   83 BBC News 2015. See also Noble 2018.   84 Sharp 2009.   85 Regan 2016.   86 Buolamwini and Gebru 2018.  
30 Translation tools   The AI behind automated translation tools can also reflect  inequality and discrimination. If people  type "He is a doctor. She  is a nurse " into Google Translate and translate the phrases into  Turkish, Google Translate provides:  "O bir hemşire. O bir  doktor ". Those Turkish sentences are gender -neutral; Tur kish  does not differentiate between  the words  "he" and "she". When  translating the Turkish text into English again, Google Translate   provides: "She is a nurse. He is a doctor ".   The example is taken from research  by Caliskan, Bryson and  Narayanan, which shows "that machines can learn word  associations from written texts and that these associations  mirror those learned by humans. "87 In other words, "natural  language necessarily contains human biases, and the pa radigm  of training machine learning on language corpora means that AI  will inevitably imbibe these biases as well. "88   Prates, Avelar and Lamb tested twelve  gender -neutral  languages, such as Hungarian and Chinese, in Google  Translate. The authors wr ote sentences such as "he/she is an  engineer " in the gender -neutral languages and translate d the  sentences into English with Google Translate. The authors  conclude d that Google Translate "exhibits a strong tendency  towards male defaults ". 89 Moreover, "male defaults are not only  prominent but exaggerated in fields suggested to be troubled  with gender stereotypes, such as STEM (Science, Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics) jobs. "90 In sum, AI -driven  translation tools can provide results that reflect existin g gender  inequality. Perhaps such results could also worsen inequality,  as they could influence people ’s ideas.   Nuancing the risk s                                                      87 Caliskan, Bryson and Narayanan 2017.   88 Narayanan 2016.   89 Prates, Avelar and Lamb 2018, p. 1.   90 Prates, Avelar and Lamb 2018, p. 28.  
31 We saw that AI decision -making could have discriminatory  effects  – but AI systems do not necessarily perform worse than  humans. Unfortunately, many humans also make discriminatory  decisions. Indeed, in some cases, AI systems discriminate  because they were trained on data that reflect discrimination by  humans. Hence, i t makes a difference whether one compares  AI decision -making  with human decision s in the real world  (which, unfortunately, are sometimes discriminatory ) or with  hypothetical decisions in an ideal world without discrimination.91  Of course, the goal should be a world  without any unfair or  illegal discrimination.   Apart from that, AI could also be used to discover discrimination  or inequality.92 Suppose an  AI system shows that a collection of  stock photos contains gender stereotypes. One way of  interpreting such a finding is that the AI system illustrates   stereotyped behaviour that already exists . Hence, an AI system  could help to discover existing inequality that might have  remained hidden otherwise.   IV. LEGAL AND  REGULATORY SAFEGUARD S  What regulatory safeguards (including redress  mechanisms) regarding AI currently exist, and which  safeguards are currently being considered?    Non-discrimination law and data protection law are t he main  legal regimes that could protect people against AI-driven  discrimination . This chapter  discusses each regime in turn  and  highlights other potential ly relevant fields of law and self regulation.  The chapter paints with a broad brush  and focuses  on the core principles  of legal regimes . Issues lying o utside the  scope of this report include  differences in regulation  in Council  of Europe member States , the territorial scope of laws and  enforcement of laws against organisations  in other  States .                                                         91 See also Tene and Polonetsky 2017.   92 See Munoz, Smith and Pati l 2016, p. 14.  
32 1. NON -DISCRIMINATION LAW   Discrimination is prohibited in man y treaties and constitutions ,  including t he European Convention on Human Rights .93  Article  14 of the European Convention on Human Rights s tates:   “The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms  set forth in this Convention  shall be secured  without discrimination on any ground such  as sex, race, colour, language, religion,  political or other opinion, national or social  origin, association with a national minority,  property, birth or other status.94”  Both direct and indirect discrimination are prohibited by the  European Convention on Human Rights.95 Direct discrimination  means, roughly summarised, that people are discriminated   against  on the basis of a protected charact eristic, such as racial  origin. The European Court of Human Rights describes direct  discrimination as follows: "there must be a difference in the  treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar,                                                      93 See e.g. Article 7 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights; Article 26 of the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental  Rights of the European Union.   94 Protocol 12 to that Con vention lays down a similar prohibition, with, regarding certain  aspects, a broader scope. " The enjoyment of any right set forth by law shall be secured without  discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other  opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other  status." Article 1, Protocol No. 12 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and  Fundamental Freedoms, European Treaty Series - No. 177, Rome, 4. XI.2000. On  18 September 2018, the total number of ratifications of/accessions to Protocol 12 stood at 20.  See, for an up -to-date list: https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/search -on-treaties/ /conventions/treaty/177/signatures?p_auth=0Kq9rtcm .  95 While the European Convention on Human Rights has some horizontal effect, the  Convention does not directly regulate discrimination in the  private sector.  
33 situations ", which is based "on an identifiable characteristic ".96  EU law non-discrim ination law  uses a similar definition .97   Indirect discrimination occurs, roughly speaking, when  a  practice is neutral at first  glance but ends up discriminating  against people of a certain racial origin (or another protected  characteristic).98 Indirect disc rimination is called "disparate  impact " in the United States. Indirect discrimination is described  as follows by the European Court of Human Rights:   “[A] difference in treatment may take the  form of disproportionately prejudicial effects  of a general polic y or measure which,  though couched in neutral terms,  discriminates against a group.  Such a  situation may amount to "indirect  discrimination ", which does not necessarily  require a discriminatory intent. ”99  Indirect discrimination is defined similar ly in EU law :  “Indirect discrimination shall be taken to  occur where an apparently neutral provision,  criterion or practice would put persons of a  racial or ethnic origin at a particular  disadvantage compared with other persons,  unless that provision, criter ion or practice is                                                      96 ECtHR, Biao v. Denmark (Grand Chamber), No. 38590/10, 24 May 2016, para. 89.   97 Direct discrimination is defined as follows in Article 2(2)(a) of the Racial Equality Directive  2000/43/EC:   "Direct discrimination shall be taken to occur wh ere one person is treated less favourably than  another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on grounds of racial or ethnic  origin." the Employment Equality Directive (2000/78/EC), the Gender Goods and Services  Directive (2004/113/EC) and the Recast Gender Equality Directive (2006/54/EC) use similar  definitions. But even within the European Union, non -discrimination law is only partly  harmonised.   98 See, generally on the concept of indirect discrimination: Tobler 2005; Ellis and Watson 2012,  p. 148 -155.  99 ECtHR, Biao v. Denmark (Grand Chamber), No. 38590/10, 24 May 2016, para. 103.  
34 objectively justified by a legitimate aim and  the means of achieving that aim are  appropriate and necessary. ”100  AI decision -making can unintentionally lead to indirect  discrimination. Regarding indirect discrimination, the law  focuses on the effects of a practice, rather than on the intention  of the alleged discriminator.101 Hence, it is not relevant whether  the discriminator had the intention to discriminate.   Non-discrimination law can be used to fight discriminatory AI  decisions. For inst ance, AI decisions that make people from a  certain racial background pay more for goods and services  could breach the prohibition of indirect discrimination. With AI  decision -making, accidental indirect discrimination probably  occurs more often than intent ional discrimination.   However, non -discrimination law has several weaknesses in the  context of AI decision -making. The prohibition of indirect  discrimination does not provide a clear and easily applicable  rule.102 The concept of indirect discrimination results in rather  open -ended standards, which are often difficult to apply in  practice. It needs to be proven that a seemingly neutral rule,  practice or decision disproportionately affects a protected group  and is th ereby prima facie discriminatory. In many  cases,  statistical evidence is used to show such a disproportionate  effect.103   The European Court of Human Rights accepts that such a  suspicion of indirect discrimination can be rebutted if the alleged  discriminator  can invoke an objective justification:                                                       100 Article 2(2)(b) of the Racial Equality Directive 2000/43/EC; capitalisation and punctuation  adapted.   101 ECtHR, Biao v. Denmark (Grand Chamber), No. 38590/10,  24 May 2016, para. 103. See  also Hacker 2018, p. 1153.   102 We could say: the prohibition of indirect discrimination is closer to a "standard" than to a  "rule". See Sunstein 1995; Baldwin, Cave and Lodge 2011, chapter 14.   103 ECtHR, D.H. and Others v. Czech Republic (Grand Chamber), No.  57325/00, 13  November  2007, paras. 187 -188. 
35 “A general policy or measure that has  disproportionately prejudicial effects on a  particular group may be considered  discriminatory even where it is not  specifically aimed at that group and there is  no discriminator y intent. This is only the  case, however, if such policy or measure  has no "objective and reasonable "  justification ”.104  Such a justification must be objective and reasonable, and a  measure, practice or rule does not meet these requirements if  it:  “has no ob jective and reasonable  justification, that is if it does not pursue a  legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable  relationship of proportionality between the  means employed and the aim sought to be  achieved ”.105  Along similar lines, EU law says that a practice will not constitute  indirect discrimination if it “is objectively justified by a legitimate  aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and  necessary ”.106 Whether an alleged discriminator can invok e  such an objective justification depends on all the circumstances  of a case and requires a nuanced proportionality test.107  Therefore, it is not always clear whether a certain practice  breaches the prohibition of indirect discrimination.                                                       104 ECtHR, Biao v. Denmark (Grand Chamber), No. 38590/10, 24 May 2016, paras. 91 and 92.  I deleted internal citations and numbering from the quotation.   105 ECtHR, Biao v. Denmark (Grand  Chamber), No. 38590 /10, 24 May 2016, para. 90. See  also  ECtHR, Case "relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in  Belgium", No. 1474/62 and others, 23  July 1968, para. B.10.   106 Article 2(2)(b) of the Racial Equality Directive 2000/43/EC.   107 Collins and Khaitan 2018, p. 21; Hacker 2018, pp. 1161 -1170.  
36 The requirement th at a prima facie case of indirect  discrimination must be shown may also cause difficulties, since  this type of discrimination can remain hidden. Suppose that  somebody applies for a loan on the website of a bank. The bank  uses an AI system to decide on such  requests. If the bank  automatically denies a loan to a customer on its website, the  customer does not see why the loan was denied. Moreover, the  customer cannot see whether the bank ’s AI system denies  loans to a disproportionate percentage of, for instanc e,  women.108 So even if customers knew that an AI system rather  than a bank employee decided, it would be difficult for them to  discover whether the AI system is discriminatory.   Another  weakness relates to non -discrimination law ’s concept  of protected chara cteristics. Non -discrimination statutes  typically focus on ( direct and indirect) discrimination based on  protected characteristics, such as race, gender or sexual  orientation.109 But many new types of AI -driven differentiation  seem unfair and problematic – some might say discriminatory –  while they remain outside the scope of most non -discrimination  statutes. Hence, non -discrimination law leaves gaps. In section  IV.3, we return to such unfair types of differentiation that might  escape non -discrimination law.   In conclusion, non -discrimination law, in particular through the  concept of indirect discrimination, prohibits many discriminatory  effects of AI. However, enforcement is difficult, and non discrimination law has weaknesses. The next section takes a  look at  data protection law.   2. DATA PROTECTION LAW   Data protection law is a legal tool that aims to defend fairness  and fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy and the right                                                      108 See Larson et al 2017 for a similar example in real life: "These are the job ads you can’t see  on Facebook if you’re older".   109 Gerards 2007; Khaitan 2015.  
37 to non -discrimination.110 Data protection law grants rights to  people whose data are being processed (data subjects)111 and  imposes obligations on parties that process personal data (data  controllers).112 Eight principles form the core of data protection  law; the y can be summarised as follows :   (a)  Personal data may only be processed  lawfully, fairly and transparently   ("lawfulness, fairness, and  transparency ").   (b)  Such data may only be collected for a  purpose that is specified in advance,  and should not be used for other  unrelated purposes ( "purpose  limitation ").   (c)  Such  data should be limited to what is  necessary for the processing purpose  ("data minimisation ").   (d)  Such  data should  be sufficiently  accurate and up -to-date ( "accuracy ").   (e)  Such  data should not be retained  for an   unreasonably long period ("storage  limitation ").   (f)  Such  data should be secured against  data breaches, illegal use etc ( "integrity  and confidentiality ").113                                                      110 See Article 1(2) and recital 71, 75, and 85 GDPR, and Article 1 of the COE Data Protection  Convention 2018; Council of Europe Big Data Guidelines 2017, article 2.3.   111 Article 4(1) GDPR; Article 2(a) COE Data Protection Conven tion 2018.   112 Article 4(7) GDPR; Article 2(d) COE Data Protection Convention 2018.   113 Article 5(1)(a) -5(1)(f) GDPR; Articles 5, 7, and 10 COE Data Protection Convention 2018.  
38 (g)  The data controller is responsible for  compliance ( "accountability ").114   These principles are  included in the Council of Europe ’s Data  Protection Convention  108 (revised in 2018115) and the  European Union ’s General Data Protection regulation (GDPR ,  from 2016 ). Similar principles are included in more than a  hundred  national data privacy laws in the world.116   Data protection law could help mitigate risks of unfair and illegal  discrimination.117 For instance, data protection law requires  transparency about personal data processing . Therefore,  organisations must provide i nformation, for instance in a privacy  notice, about all stages of an AI decision -making  process that  involve personal data.118 It is t rue that most people do  not read  privacy notices.119 Nevertheless, such notices could be helpful  for researchers, journalists,  and supervisory authorities.  If a  privacy notice suggests that a processing practice could have  discriminatory effects, authorities can investigate.   Under certain circumstances , the GDPR and Data Protection  Convention 108 require  organisations (data controllers) to  conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) . An impact  assessment can be described as follows:   An impact assessment is a tool used for the  analysis of possible consequences of an  initiative on a relevant societal concern or  concerns,  if this initiative can present  dangers to these concerns, with a view to                                                      114 Article 5(2) of the GDPR; Article 10(1) COE Data Protection Convention 2018.   115 Article 5, 7, and 10 COE Data Protection Convention 2018.   116 Greenleaf 2017.   117 See, on the interplay between data protection law and discrimination law: Schreurs et al.  2008; Gellert et al. 2013; Hacker 2018; Lammerant, De Hert, Blok 2017.   118 Article 5(1)(a ); Article 13; Article 14 GDPR; Articles 5(4)(a) and 8 COE Data Protection  Convention 2018.   119 Zuiderveen Borgesius 2015.  
39 support ing informed decision -making  whether to deploy this initiative and under  what conditions, ultimately constituting a  means to protect these concerns.120  The GDPR requires a  DPIA when a practice is "likely to result  in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons ",  especially when using new technologies.121 In some  circumstances, the GDPR always requires a DPIA (because the  GDPR assumes a high risk), for instance when or ganisations  take fully automated decisions that have legal or similar effects  for people.122 Hence , for many AI systems that make decisions  about people, the GDPR requires a DPIA.123 The risk of unfair  or illegal discrimination must also be considered when  conducting a DPIA.124   Under the Council of Europe ’s Data Protection Convention 108,  and under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European  Union, each member State must have an independent  Data  Protection Authority .125 Such Data Protection Authorities must  have powers of investigation.126 The GDPR gives most details  about the investigati ve powers of Data Protection Authorities. A  Data Protection Authority can, for instance, obtain access to  premises of controllers , carry out investigations in the form of  data protection audits and order data controllers to provide                                                      120 Kloza et al. 2017, p. 1.

40 information and to give access to their data processing  systems .127      Rules on automated decisions   The GDPR contains  specific rules for certain types of  "automated individual decision -making ".128 These rules aim,  among other things, to mitigat e the risk of illegal  discrimination.129 The Council of Europe ’s Data Protection  Convention  also contains rules on automated decision s, which  are less detailed than in the GDPR .130 Here, we focus on the  GDPR.    Article 22  of the GDPR , sometimes called the Kafka provision,  contains an in -principle prohibition of fully automated decisions  with legal or similar significant  effects and applies, for instance,  to fully automated e-recruiting practices without human  intervention.131  The predecessor of the GDPR already had a  similar provision, which has not been applied much in  practice.132 The main rule of the GDPR ’s provision on  automated individual decision -making reads as follows:   The data subject shall have the right not to  be subject to a decision based solely  on  automated processing, including profiling,133                                                      127 Article 58(1) GDPR. The Data Protection Authorit y can also exercise these rights against  "processors", organisations that process personal data for data controllers.   128 Article 22 GDPR. The discussion of the GDPR’s rules on automated decisions is based on  and includes sentences from Zuiderveen Borgesius  and Poort 2017.   129 See Recital 71 GDPR.   130 Article 9(1)(a) COE Data Protection Convention 2018.   131 Recital 71 GDPR.   132 Korff 2012. The predecessor was Article 15 of the Data Pro tection Directive. That Article  15  was based on a provision of the Data Protecti on Act of France from 1978. See  Bygrave 2001.   133 The GDPR defines "profiling" as follows: "'Profiling' means any form of automated  processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal  aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that  natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,  interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements." Art. 4(4) GDPR.  
41 which produces legal effects concerning him  or her or similarly significantly affects him or  her.134  Roughly summarised:  people may not be subjected to certain  automated decisions with far -reaching effects. The GDPR says  people have a "right not to be subject to " certain decisions. But  it is generally  assumed that this right implies an in -principle  prohibition of such decisions.135   Slightly rephrasing Mendoza and Bygrave, four conditions must  be met for the provision to apply: (i) there is a decision, which is  based (ii) solely (ii i) on automated data processing ; (iv) the  decision has legal or similarly significant effects for the  person.136  An example of a decision with "legal effects " would be a court  decision , or decision regarding a social benefit granted by law,  such as pension payments.137 An example of a decision with  "similarly significantly " effects would be a bank that denies credit   automatically.138 And D ata Protection Authorities say that o nline  price differentiation could "similarly significantly affect "  somebody, if it leads to "prohibitively high prices [that]  effectively bar someone from certain goods or services. "139   There are exceptions to the in -principle prohibition of certain  automated decisions. In short, the prohibition does not apply  if  the automated decision (i) is based on the individual ’s explicit                                                      134 Art. 22 GDPR.   135 De Hert and Gutwirth 2008; Korff 2012; Wachter, Mittelstadt, and Floridi 2017; Zuiderveen  Borgesius 2015a.   136 Mendoza and Bygrave 2017.   137 See Article 29 Working Party 2018 (WP251), p. 21.   138 Recital 71 GDPR. See for more examples that "could" constitute aut omated decisions that  "similarly significantly affect" people: Article 29 Working Party 2018 (WP251), p. 22.   139 Article 29 Working Party 2018 (WP251). p. 22.  
42 consent;  (ii) is necessary for a contract between the individual   and the data controller; or (iii) is authorised by law.140   If a controller can rely on the (i) consent or (ii) contract exception  to bypass the prohibition, a different rule is triggered: "the data  controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the  data subject ’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at  least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the  controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the  decision ".141 Hence, in some circumstances, the data subjec t  can ask for a human to reconsider the automated decision. For  instance, a bank could ensure that customers can call the bank  to have a  human reconsider the decision, if the bank  automatically denies them a loan through the bank ’s website.   In addition to its general transparency requirements, t he GDPR  also contains transparency requirements specific to automated  decisions :   [T]he controller shall provide the data  subject with the following information (...) the  existence of automated decision -making,  including profiling (...) and, at least in those  cases, meaningful information about the  logic involved, as well as the significance  and the envisaged consequences of such  processing for the data subject.142  Hence, in some cases, an organisation  would have to exp lain  that it uses AI decision -making  and would have to provide  meaningful information about the logic of that process.   There has been a great deal of scholarly attention as to whether  the GDPR ’s rules on automated decisions create a "right to                                                      140 Article 29 Working Party 2018 (WP251), p. 22.   141 Article 22(3) GDPR. As Kaminski notes, the GDPR’s  text "creates a version of algorithmic  due process: a right to an opportunity to be heard." Kaminski 2018a, p. 8.   142 Article 13(2)(f) and 14(2)(f) GDPR.  
43 explanation " of individual decisions.143 Recital 71 suggests the  existence of an individual right to "explanation " of AI decisions  – a right that could be useful to protect fairness.144  Many s cholars are sceptical of whether such a right would be  effective, noting for instance that many types of automated  decisions remain outside the scope of the GDPR ’s rules .145 To  illustrate: the GDPR ’s automated decision provision only  applies to decisions bas ed "solely " on automated processing.  Hence, when a bank employee denies a loan on the basis of a  recommendation by an AI system, as long as the employee is  not rubber -stamping, the provision does not apply.146                                                         143 See for instance Edwards and Veale 2017; Goodman and Flaxman 2016; Kaminski 2018;  Kaminski 2018a; Ma lgieri G and Comandé 2017; Mendoza and Bygrave 2017; Selbst and  Powles 2017; Wachter et al. 2017.   144 Recital 71: "such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards, which should include  (..) the right (…) to obtain an explanation of the decision reac hed after such assessment".   145 See for instance Edwards and Veale 2017; Wachter et al. 2017; Zuiderveen Borgesius  2015a, chapter 9, section 6.   146 See Article 29 Working Party 2018 (WP251). The Working Party says that a superficial  check by a human (rubber stamping) is not sufficient. However, as noted by Veale and Edwards  2018, it is not clear how organisations are supposed to ensure that decisions have non superficial human input.  
44 It remains to be seen what the practical effec t of these GDPR  provisions will be. As noted, the predecessor of the GDPR  provision on automated decisions has remained a dead letter.  Regardless, the attention to the GDPR provisions has helped to  foster an interdisciplinary discussion on explaining AI de cisions.   The modernised Convention 108 appears more generous for  individuals in its phrasing around explanation rights. Unlike the  GDPR provision, which applies to decisions that have  significant effect and are "solely " based on automated  processing, Conv ention 108 gives individuals a right "to obtain,  on request, knowledge of the reasoning underlying data  processing where the results of such processing are applied to  him or her ".147 The breadth of what it means to "apply " a "result "  is yet to be seen in practice in any national implementations.   Caveats   Several caveats are in order r egarding da ta protection law ’s  possibilities as a tool to fight AI-driven discrimination. First, t here  is a compliance and enforcement deficit. Data Prote ction  Authorities  have limited resources. And many Data Protection  Authorities  do not have the power to impose serious sanctions   (in the EU, such authorities received  new powers with the  GDPR) . Previously, m any organisations did not take  compliance with da ta protection law seriously.148 It appears that  compliance improved with the arrival of the GDPR, but it is too  early to tell.   Second , parts of algorithmic processes are outside the scope of  data protection law. Data protection law o nly applies when  personal data are processed. It does not apply to predictive  models  because they do not relate to identifiable persons. For  example,  a predictive model that says "80% of the people living                                                      147 Article 9(1)(c) COE Data Protection Convention 2018: "Every individual sha ll have a right  (…) to obtain, on request, knowledge of the reasoning underlying data processing where the  results of such processing are applied to him or her". See Veale and Edwards 2018.   148 See Zuiderveen Borgesius 2015a, chapter 8, section 2.  
45 in postal code F -67075 pay their bills late " is not  a personal  datum, as the model does not refer to an individual. (When a  predictive model is applied to an individual, data protection law  applies again.149)  Third , data protection law uses many open and abstract norms,  rather than black -and-white rules.150 Data protection law must  use open norms, because its provisions apply in many different  situations, in the private and the public sector. This regulatory  approach, an omnibus approach, has many advantages. For  instance, the open norms do not have to be adapt ed each time  when a new technology is developed . But one disadvantage is  that the open norms  can be difficult to apply.151  Fourth, data protection law has strict rules on "special  categories " of data  (sometimes called "sensitive data "), such as  data regarding racial origin  or revealing health status.152 Those  rules create challenges for assessing and mitigating  discrimination . Many of the methods to tackle discrimination in  AI systems implicitly assume that organisations hold th ese  sensitive data – yet to meet data protection law, many  organisations may not be  holding them . Tension remains  between respecting data protection law and collecting sensitive  data to fight discrimination.153  Fifth, even where explanations of AI decisions might be legally  required by the GDPR or Convention 108, it is often difficult to  explain the logic behind a decision, when an AI system,                                                      149 See Zui derveen Borgesius 2015a, chapter 2 and chapter 5. See, on the weaknesses of data  protection law in the area of AI decision -making: Wachter and Mittelstadt 2018.   150 Zuiderveen Borgesius 2015a, chapter 9, section 1.   151 See, on different types of legal rules: Chapter VI, section 1.   152 Article 9 GDPR; article 6 COE Data Protection Convention 2018. The strict rules for special  categories of data aim, in part, to fight discrimination. See on "special categories of data" in the  context of AI: Malgieri and Comandé 2017a.   153 Goodman 2016; Ringelheim and De Schutter 2008; Ringelheim and De Schutter 2009;  Veale and Binns 2017; Žliobaitė and Custers 2016. Some methods to audit AI systems while  maintaining privacy using cryptograph y are emerging. See Kilbertus et al. 2018.  
46 analysing large amounts of data, arrives at that decision.154 And  in some cases, it is not clear how much an explanation would  help people, especially insofar as it places the burden on them  to understand the decision and its appropriateness.155   That said, more transparency and explanation of AI decisions  could be useful. For more than a decade, scholars have been  calling for the development of transparency -enhancing  technologies (TETs), to enable meaningful transparency  regarding automated decision -making.156 Such technologies  should "aim at making information flows more transparent  through feedback and awareness thus enabl ing individuals as  well as collectives to better understand how information is  collected, aggregated, analy sed and used for decision making. "157 Computer scientists are exploring various forms of  explainable AI.158  In any case, it is much too early to assess t he effect of the  modernised  Convention 108 and the GDPR. More legal  research is needed on how data protection law could help to  mitigate discrimination risks.159 While data protection law is  largely untested as a non -discrimination tool , it does offer  possib ilities to fight illegal discrimination.                                                       154 Ananny and Crawford 2016; Burrell 2016; Binns et al. 2018; Edwards and Veale 2017;  Hildebrand 2015; Kroll et al. 2016; 2018; Wachter, Mittelstadt and Russell 2017.    155 Edwards and Veale 2017.   156 Hildebrandt and G utwirth 2008, chapter 17.   157 Diaz and Gürses 2012.   158 See Guidotti et al. 2018; Miller 2017; Selbst and Barocas 2018; Tickle et al. 1998.

See for instance: Goodman 2016; Mantelero 2018; Hacker 2018; Hoboken and Kostic  (forthcoming); Wachter 2018; Wachter and Mittelstadt 2018.  
47 3. OTHER REGULATION   In the area of AI decisions, other fields of law could also help to  ensure fairness, and perhaps help to mitigate discrimination related  problems. For example, consumer law could be invoked  to protect consumers against some types of manipulative AI driven advertising.160 As discriminatory behaviour by a company  causes more problems when the company has a monopoly  position, competition law could also help to protect people.161  For the public sector, administrative law and criminal law could  be relevant to protect fair procedures .162 Freedom of information  laws could be used to obtain information about public sector AI  systems.163 But the applicati on of these fields of law to protect  people in the area of AI is largely unexplored. A discussion of  those fields of law falls outside the scope of this report.   Regulation under consideration   Several regulatory measures that could be relevant for AI-driven   discrimination  are currently being considered. The Council of  Europe ’s Consultative Committee of the Convention for the  Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of  Personal Data published a draft report in September 2018:  "Artificial intelligence and data protection: challenges and  possible remedies ."164  The Council of Europe ’s Steering Committee on Media and  Information Society has set up an expert committee on AI: the  Committee of Experts on human rights dimensions of  automated data processing and different forms of artificial                                                      160 See, on AI and consumer law: European Data  Protection Supervisor 2014; Helberger,  Zuiderveen Borgesius and Reyna 2017; Jabłonowska et al. 2018.   161 See, on AI and competition law: Ezrachi and Stucke 2016; Graef 2016; Graef 2017; Valcke,  Graef and Clifford 2018; Van Nooren et al. 2018.    162 See, on AI and administrative law: Van Eck 2018; Oswald 2018, Cobbe 2018.   163 See Rieke, Bogen and Robinson 2018, p. 24; Fink 2018; Oswald and Grace 2016.   164 Mantelero 2018.   
48 intelligence. The expert  committee will conduct studies  and give  guidance for possible future standard -setting.165  The European Union is active in the area of AI too. In 2018, t he  European Commission published a c ommunication on AI, and  has set up a High -Level Expert Group on Artificial  Intelligence,166 which is tasked with propos ing draft AI Ethics  Guidelines.167 The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights is also  examining  AI.168 Furthermore, in 2017 the Commission  proposed a n ePrivacy Regulation to protect privacy on the  Internet , which could be relevant for AI and machine learning,  as it would limit the collection of certain types of privacy sensitive data on the Internet .169   An EU Regulation from 2016 concerns on e type of AI decision:  algorithmic trading on stock exchanges etc. The Regulation  states: "An investment firm shall ensure that its compliance staff  has at least a general understanding of how the algorithmic  trading systems and trading algorithms of the in vestment firm  operate. "170 Moreover, "an investment firm shall establish and  monitor its trading systems and trading algorithms through a  clear and formalised governance arrangement ".171 Perhaps  similar requirements could be adopted for other sectors.    Self-regulation                                                       165 Council of Europe MSI -AUT 2018.   166  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/high -level-expert -group -artificial -intelligence   accessed 26 September 2018.   167 European Commission, Artificial Intelligence for Europe, 2018, p. 16.

49 Several organisations have proposed principles that aim for fair ,  accountable or ethical AI. For example, the organisation  FATML, Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine  Learning, published "Principles for accountable algorithms and   a social impact statement for algorithms "172 The principles call  for organisations to "ensure that algorithmic decisions do not  create discriminatory or unjust impacts when comparing across  different demographics (eg race, sex, etc). "173  There are other self -regulatory principles on ethics and AI, often  less focused on discrimination. Examples include the Asilomar  AI principles of the (US -based) Future of Life Institute,174 the  Montr eal Declaration for Responsible AI175 and the Principles  for ethical AI of the UNI  Global Union.176 IEEE, a technical  professional organisation, launched a Global Initiative on Ethics  of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems.177 A "Partnership on AI  to Benefit People and Society " was set up by Apple, Amazon,  DeepMind and Google, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft, to study  and formulate best practices on AI technologies.178 In principle ,  such self -regulation principles are laudable. Ethical AI is  obviously better than unethical AI. Self-regulatory principles  could help to mitigate discrimination problems and could  provide inspiration for law-makers .                                                       172  https://www.fatml.org/resources/principles -for-accountable -algorithms   accessed  24 September 2018.   173  https://www.fatm l.org/resources/principles -for-accountable -algorithms   accessed  24 September 2018.   174 https://futureoflife.org/ai -principles/  accessed 24 September 2018.   175  https://www.montrealdeclaration -responsibleai.com/the -declaration  accessed  24 September 2018.   176  http://www.thefutureworldofwork.org/opinions/10 -principles -for-ethical -ai/ accessed  24 September 2018.   177 https://standards.ieee.org/industry -connections/ec/autonomou s-systems.html  accessed  24 September 2018.

See for a list of, and  critique of, other ethics principles for AI: Greene, Hoffman and Stark 2018.  
50 However, protecting human  rights cannot be left to selfregulation or soft law.179 The main problem is that self regulation is non-binding. More over, the above -mentioned  principles are often somewhat abstract and do not give detailed  guidance.180 Wagner warns against  "ethics washing " in the  context of AI : "much of the debate about ethics seems  increasingly focussed on private companies avoiding  regulation. Unable or unwilling to properly provide regulatory  solutions, ethics is seen as the "easy " or "soft" option which can  help structure and give meaning to e xisting self -regulatory  initiatives. "181 Indeed, s elf-regulation and soft law should not  distract from a possible need for (hard) legal regulation . Chapter  VI discusses how the law could be improved.  But first we turn  to recommendations to organisations usin g AI, and to human  rights monitoring bodies  and Equality Bodies .     V. RECOMMENDATIONS   What recommendations can be made on mitigating the  risks of discriminatory AI, to organisations using AI, to  Equality Bodies in Council of Europe member States , and  to human rights monitoring bodies, such as the European  Commission against Racism and Intolerance?   1. ORGANISATIONS USING A I  Several measures are important for public and private  organisations wishing  to prevent discrimination when they use  AI. Such me asures include education, obtaining technical and  legal expertise, and careful planning of AI projects.                                                          179 See, generally on self -regulation and fundamental rights: Angelopoulos et al. 2016.   180 See Campolo et al. 2017, p. 34.   181 Wagner 2018. See also Nemitz 2018.  
51 Education   Education is important to make organisations realise the risks  of accidental AI -driven discrimination. Relevant employees of  an organisation – including managers, lawyers, and computer  scientists – should be aware of the risks. As we have seen , in  many exa mples of discriminatory AI, the organisations did not  set out  to discriminate. If such organisations had been aware of  the risks, they might have been able to prevent th at  discrimination. Perhaps e ducation could  also help to mitigate  the effects of "automa tion bias " among employees .182  Risk assessment and mitigation   When an organisation starts an AI project, it should perform risk  assessment and risk mitigation. This entails (i) involving  individuals from multiple disciplines, such as computer science   and law, to define the risks of a project; (ii) recording both the  assessment and mitigation processes; (iii) monitoring the  implementation of a project; and (iv) often reporting outward in  some way, either to the public or to an oversight body.183  Organisations  should ensure that they receive help from  computer scientists who understand discrimination risks. (The  phrase "computer scientist " is used here as shorthand. Data  scientists or other and people with sufficient knowledge of AI  could also provide expertise ). An emerging field in computer  science focuses on discrimination risks in the field of AI  decisions. Since 2014, an organisation called FATML organises  workshops and conferences, with the aim of "[b]ringing together  a growing community of researchers and  practitioners  concerned with fairness, accountability and transparency in  machine learning. "184 Computer scientists have published                                                      182 Citron 2007, p. 1306. See, on automation bias: Parasur aman and Manzey 2010; Rieke,  Bogen and Robinson 2018, p. 11.   183 See eg AI Now Institute 2018; Mantelero 2018; Mantelero 2018a.   184 https://www.fatml.org  accessed 1 August 2018.  
52 promising results, for instance on discrimination -aware data  mining.185   Defining the risks of an AI project can be challenging.  When left  alone, computer scientists have to make value -laden decisions  while building an AI system, and often find risks or choices hard  to communicate to senior decision -makers.186 Assessing and  mitigating discrimination risks requires active support for those  developing AI systems, and the time and money needed for this  should be an active consideration in all relevant projects.   The risks and applicable legal and normative principles are  different for each sector. Different risks are involved for an AI  system that selects job applicants, for example, than for one that  predicts crime. Therefore, e xperts with knowledge of a  particular sector should be involved.187 It may be useful to set  up an ethics committee to assess and discuss AI systems that  entail  risks for human rights.188 It can also be useful to bring in  academics, civil society group s and potentially impacted  individuals to discuss their concerns over the system.189  One way to assess the risks of an AI project is to carry out  an  appropriate type of impa ct assessment. Inspiration can be  drawn from the GDPR ’s DPIA requirement for certain risky data  processing operations.190 And organisations – especially in the  public sector – should consider publishing the impact  assessment  report .                                                       185 See eg Custers et al. 2013; Kamiran and C alders 2009; Kamiran and Calders 2012; Kusner  et al. 2017; Pedreschi, Ruggieri and Turini 2008.   186 Veale, Van Kleek and Binns 2018. Kaminski 2018a, p. 30: "engineers should not be defining  "discrimination" or "fairness" without extensive conversation with lawyers and community  members.   187 Campolo et al. 2017, p. 2.   188 Council of Europe Big Data Guidelines 2017, para. 1.3.   189 See Article 35(9) GDPR.   190 See Council of Europe Big Data Guidelines 2017, Article 2.5. See also Reisman et al. 2018;  Selbst 2017.  
53 The risks of the AI syst em should also be monitored during its  use, particularly as the phenomena the AI system is modelling  are likely to change over time, and the risks and impacts may  change with them.191 Organisations should consider publishing  yearly reports monitoring the system.    It is often possible to prevent, or at least minimise,  discriminatory effects. For instance, an organisation can choose  not to use certain features as input data in their AI sy stem. To  illustrate: one US company that helps to select employees says   that it does not use "distance to work " as a factor to predict  which applicants will be successful employees, because that  factor correlates too much with race. As reported by The  Atlantic: "The distance an employee lives from work, for  instance, is never factored into the score given each applicant,  although it is reported to some clients. That ’s because different  neighbourhoods  and towns can have different racial profiles,  which means  that scoring distance from work could violate  equal -employment -opportunity standards. "192     At AI companies and university research labs, the workforce is  often not diverse – largely male and white for instance. Such  organisations might pay more attention to discrimination  when  they have a more diverse workforce. Hence, organisations  should aim to hire a more diverse workforce.193 Obviously ,  aiming for a more diverse workforce is always important.                                                            191 See also Article 35(110 GDPR; Gama et al 2014.   192 Peck 2013. See also Rieke, Robinson and Yu 2014, p. 15.   193 Campolo et al. 2017, p. 16.  
54 Public sector bodies   Compared to the private sector, the public sector has extra  responsibilities. Indeed, many legal rules, for instance in the  field of human rights, criminal procedure law and administrative  law, aim to protect people against the powerful State . The extra  responsibilities also apply when publi c sector bodies use AI  systems.   Therefore, where possible, AI systems in the public sector  should be designed for transparency.194 In some situations,  information about AI systems could be released to the public for  scrutiny, in the spirit of the Open Data movement. Yet in some  cases, such information  might leak personal data and create  privacy risk s195 or might allow  people to  game  the AI system .196  Therefore, public bodies might want to enable controlled access  to their AI systems  for researchers or civil society in secure  environments, much as statistical agencies do to sensitive  microdata today.197  Furthermore, public sector could  adopt a sunset clause when  introducing AI systems that take decisions abou t people. Such  a sunset clause could require that a system should be  evaluated, say after three years, to assess whether it brought  what was hoped for.198 If the results are disappointing, or if the  disadvantages or the risks are too great, consider ation  should  be given to abolish ing the s ystem. While public sector bodies  have extra responsibilities, private sector organisations such as  companies can take similar measures to those  proposed above  for the public sector.                                                       194 See Kroll et al. 2016; Munoz, Smith and Patil, 2016.   195 Veale, Binns and Edwards 2018.   196 Laskov and Lippman 2011; Bamb auer and Zarsky 2018.   197 See, on various degrees of openness in the open data context: Zuiderveen Borgesius, Gray  and Van Eechoud 2015.   198 McCray, Oye and Petersen 2010; Broeders, Schrijvers and Hirsch Ballin, p. 23.   
55 2. EQUALITY BODIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS  MONITORING BODIES   What recommendations can be made to Equality Bodies in  Council of Europe member States  and to human rights  monitoring bodies, such as the European Commission against  Racism and Intolerance , on mitigating the risks of AI -driven  discrimination?   Education and technical expertise   Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring bodies  should be  aware of the promise s and threats of AI. Therefore, education  for Equality Bodies and monitoring bodies  on the basics of AI  and its risks is needed.   Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring bodies  should  also ensure that they obtain technical expertise on AI, by  involving computer scientists.199 Computer scientists can  recognise and understand certain risks better than, for instance,  lawyers.200 Computer scientists, even if they are not AI  specia lists, could carry out  certain types of investigations into  AI-driven discrimination.  As Rieke, Bogen and Robinson note,  "Scrutiny doesn ’t have to be sophisticated to be successful. "201  Problems with an AI system can often be discovered through  "simple obser vation of a system ’s inputs and outputs ".202 And  computer scientists who are not AI specialists themselves often  know which specialists to hire for certain investigations.  Depending on budget, Equality Bodies and human rights  monitoring bodies  could hire computer scientists for a project,  or on a more permanent basis.                                                        199 As mentioned, the phrase "computer scientist" is used in this report as shorthand. Data  scientists or other people with sufficient knowledge of AI could also provide expertise.   200 See, on the importance of technical expertise for Data Protection Authorities: Raab and  Szekely 2017.   201 Rieke, B ogen and Robinson 2018, p. 2.   202 Rieke, Bogen and Robinson 2018, p. 8. They also give examples of scrutiny of AI systems  (p. 31 -34).  
56 Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring bodies  should  consider organising public awareness campaigns for  organisations in the public and private sector.203 As noted, in  many c ases, organisations use discriminatory AI systems by  accident. Awareness could help.   More generally, schools and universities that teach computer  science, data science, AI, and related topics should teach  students about human  rights and ethics. Many unive rsities  already offer such courses to computer science students.204  Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring bodies  could  consider assisting schools and universities with such  courses.205    To permit  public debate, it would be good if the general public  knew more about the risks of discriminatory AI  – and about  the  many advantages and possibilities of AI. However, awareness  building should not lead to responsibilisation. This term  describes "the process whereby subjects are rendered  individually responsible for a task which previously would have  been the duty of another – usually a state agency – or would not  have been recognized as a responsibility at all. "206 Policy makers should not make people responsible for defending  themselves against discrimination .207 That said, awareness is  important for an inclusive debate on the risks of AI decisions.                                                          203 See ECRI Statute Resolution 2002, Article 12; ECRI general policy recommendation no. 2  (2018), para. 13(e); para. 34, an d explanatory memorandum para. 64.   204 Fiesler 2018 compiled a list of more than 200 courses on tech ethics.   205 See ECRI general policy recommendation no. 10: on combating racism and racial  discrimination in and through school education, 15 December 2006, Str asbourg, CRI(2007)6  https://rm.coe.int/ecri -general -policy -recommendation -no-10-on-combating -racism -andracia/16808b5ad5  accessed 14 Octobe r 2018.   206 Wakefield and Fleming 2009.   207 See also Ellis and Watson 2012, p. 502 -503. 
57 Prior consultation with Equality Bodies   Equality Bodies  could require public sector bodies to discuss  with them any planned projects that involve AI decision -making  about individuals or groups. For i nstance, an Equality Body  could help to  assess whether training data are biased.208  Equality Bodies could also require each public sector body  using AI decision -making about people to ensure that it has  sufficient legal and technical expertise to assess and monitor  risks. And public sector bodies could be required to regularly  assess whether their AI systems have discriminatory effects.  (Depending on the national situation, Eq uality Bodies could also  suggest, rather than require) .  Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring bodies  could help  to develop a specific method for a "human  rights and AI impact  assessment ". As mentioned, i mpact assessments can be useful   – but to date , there is no  specific impact assessment method for  AI.209 When developing such a method, different stakeholders  and people from different disciplines should be involved.   Inspiration can be drawn from privacy and data protection  impact assessments.210    Engage i n public procurement processes   Equality Bodies  should seek, through national provisions and  processes as well as through lobbying for increased access, to  be involved in the procurement of public -sector AI systems from  an early stage. Equality Bodies  can h elp ensure that concerns  around discrimination are built into the AI systems  being                                                      208 See ECRI general policy recommendation no. 2 (2018), Article 13(g). See also Article 36  GDPR, on prior consultation.   209 Reisman et al. 2018 discuss "algorithmic impact a ssessments" in the US. But since Council  of Europe member States have different legal systems than the US, a US method can provide  inspiration, but cannot be directly applied here.    210 See Binns 2017; Kloza et al. 2017; Mantelero 2017; Wright and De Hert 2 012. See also the  Brussels Laboratory for Data Protection and Privacy Impact Assessments http://dpialab.org/ .  
58 procured: that systems are open enough to audit and subject to  appropriate safeguards.   Cooperate with Data Protection Authorities   As said, for AI-driven discrimination , the two most relevant legal  frameworks are non-discrimination law  and data protection law.  It would be a shame if those fields of law operate in their own  silos.211 Equality Bodies  should cooperate with Data Protection  Authorities. For instance, it could be hel pful to exchange  knowledge and to learn from one an other ’s experiences.212  Many Data Protection Authorities have some technical  expertise in house ,213 and some have experience with hiring  outside computer scientists for research projects .214 Data  Protection Authorities may learn about organisations that use AI  systems that entail  discrimination risks, and c ould warn Equality  Bodies . Equality Bodies  could provide information to Data  Protection Authorities, for instance about discrimination ris ks.  Depending on the national situation, it could also be useful for  Equality Bodies  to cooperate with Consumer Protection  Authorities and Competition law authorities.   For cooperation and knowledge sharing between different types  of regulators, the Europea n Data Protection Supervisor  proposed in 2016 to set up "a voluntary network of regulatory  bodies to share information (…) about possible abuses in the  digital ecosystem and the most effective way of tackling                                                      211 See Schreurs et al. 2008; Gellert et al. 2013; Hacker 2018; Lammerant, De Hert, Blok 2017.   212 See ECRI general policy recommendation no. 2 (2018), Article 13(b).   213 Raab and Szekely 2017.   214 For instance, researchers of the University of Leuven have examined Facebook’s tracking  for the Data Protection Authority in Belgium. See Belgian Data Protecti on Authority 2018.  
59 them. "215 Perhaps that initiative could provide i nspiration for  Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring bodies .216   Cooperate with academics   Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring bodies  should  keep in touch with, and perhaps cooperate with, academics.  This report illustrates how many examples of  discriminatory AI  decisions were discovered by academic researchers (and by  investigative journalists).217 Many academics love to assist   regulators but are not in regular contact with them. In the short  term, Equality Bodies and monitoring bodies  could visi t  conferences and other events where academic researchers  meet. At many international privacy conferences, discriminatory  AI is a much -debated topic. Several of these  conferences attract  a mix of regulators, practitioners, civil society group s and  scholars  from different disciplines, such as law, computer  science, philosophy and sociology.218 Equality Bodies and  monitoring bodies  could also consider organising conference s,  round tables  or other events on discrimination risks of AI, to  foster contacts between the research community and Equality  Bodies . And perhaps Equality Bodies and monitoring bodies   could commission more research on AI ’s discrimination risks                                                      215 European Data Protection Supervisor 2016.   216 As an aside: within universities too, more cooperation is needed between different types of  legal scholars, such as non -discrimination law specialists (often working at human rights  institute s) and data protection law specialists (often working at law and technology institutes).   217 See Rieke, Bogen and Robinson 2018, p. 31.   218 See for instance: the CPDP Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels  https://www.cpdpconferences.org ; the APC Amsterdam Privacy Conference  https://www.apc2018.com ; TILTing Perspectives  https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes -and-research -groups/tilt/events/tilting perspectives ; and the PLSC Privacy Law Scholars Conference http://law.berkeley.edu/plsc .

60 (see section VI. 3) or set up a working party on AI ’s  discrimination risks.219  Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring bodies  should not  only engage with civil society group s that work on  discrimination220 but also with consumer groups221 and civil  society group s that focus on technology policy and digital  rights .222 Civil society groups that work on discrimination often  have different expertise from groups that work on tech nology   and digital rights . More contact between such groups would be  useful  too, as many of them are interested in AI -driven  discrimination.223  Litig ation and regulation   Depending on the national situation, Equality Bodies could also  engage in  strategic litigation in the area of AI decision making.224 And Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring  bodies  could push for regulation  to mitigate discrimination risks  of AI.225 Suggestions to improve regulation are discussed in the  next chapter .                                                       219 See ECRI Sta tute Resolution 2002, Article 6(1); 6(2); ECRI general policy recommendation  no. 2 (2018), article 13(d).   220 See ECRI Statute Resolution 2002, Article 10(1) and 13.   221 For consumer organisations, BEUC (the European Consumer Organisation) could be a point  of contact. BEUC’s members are 43 consumer organisations from 32 European countries.  https://www.beuc.eu/about -beuc/who -we-are accessed 10 October 2018. See also European  Consumer Organisation BEUC 201 8.   222 For groups focusing on rights and freedoms in the digital environment, European Digital  Rights (EDRi) could be a point of contact. EDRi is an association of civil and human rights  organisations from across Europe. https://edri.org/members/  accessed 10 October 2018.   223 See Gangadharan and Niklas 2018, who interviewed NGOs and conclude that better  cooperation is needed between (i) privacy - and te chnology -oriented NGOs and  (ii) discrimination -oriented NGOs.   224 See ECRI general policy recommendation no. 2 (2018), Article 14 -16.  225 See ECRI Statute Resolution 2002, Article 1; ECRI general policy recommendation no. 2  (2018), Article 13(j).  
61 VI. IMPROVING  REGULATION   Which types of action (legal, regulatory, self -regulatory)  can reduce risks?     Current law  has weaknesses when applied  to AI -driven  discrimination , as we saw in chapter IV . Additional  regulation is  probably needed to protect people against illegal discrimination  and unfair differentiation. Section 1 provides preliminary  remarks about regulating in the area of fast -develop ing  technology. S ection 2 focuses on  improving enforcement of  existing non -discrimination norms . Section 3 discusses whether  the legal norms themselves  should be amended because of  AI  decision -making. The suggestions in this chapter are meant as  starting points for discussion rather than as definitive policy  advice.   1. REGULATION AND FAST -DEVELOPING  TECHNOLOGY   Regulating brings extra challenges  when the rules are to  apply  to fast -developing technology . Adopting statute s or treaties  may  take years or  even decades. Meanwhile, technology, the market  and society develop quickly.   These challenges are not unique for AI; there is experience with  regulating new technologies. When  regulating in the area of  new technologies , policy -makers can combin e differen t types of  rules, such as statutes with broad principles and guidelines (by  regulators for instance) with more specific rules.226 The statutes  could be phrased in a reasonably technology -neutral way.  Technology -neutral legal provisions with broad principles have  the advantage of not having  to be changed every time a new  technology is developed. A disadvantage is that broad  principles can be difficult to apply in practice . Therefore ,                                                      226 See Koops 2006.  
62 guidance by regulators can be useful.227 Guidelines can be  amended faster and can thus be more specific and concrete.  Guidelines should be evaluated regularly and amended  when ever required .228  Data protection law partly  takes this combined approach .229  Data protection law (such as the GDPR and the modernised  Convention 108) c ontains many broadly phrased provisions that  can be applied to different situations and technologies.230 For  instance, data protection law does not contain specific rules for  CCTV, or for monitoring in the workplace. But as far as personal  data (including on  video images) are used, d ata protection law  does apply to CCTV and workplace monitoring .   In addition to data protection law ’s statutory provisions,  Data  Protection Authorities often adopt interpretative guidelines with  more specific and concrete requirements for different situations,  such as CCTV,231 the workplace232 and automated decision making.233 In the EU, the European Data Protection Board and  its predece ssor have adopted more than 250  guidelines since  1995.234 Similarly, the Council of Europe has a dopted                                                      227 See Zuiderveen Borgesius 2 015a, chapter 9, section1; Baldwin, Cave and Lodge 2011,  chapter 14.   228 See Koops 2006.   229 I am not suggesting that data protection law should be seen as a best practice for regulating  in fields where technology develops quickly. There is plenty to criticise  in data protection law.    230 Data protection law, developed since the early 1970s, could itself be seen as the legal  answer to a new development: large -scale bureaucracies and automated personal data  processing. Since its inception, data protection law has  been adapted continuously to new  developments – as illustrated by the recent GDPR and Modernised Convention 108.   231 Article 29 Working Party 2004 (WP89).   232 Article 29 Working Party 2017 (WP249).   233 Article 29 Working Party 2018 (WP251).   234 See the website o f the European Data Protection Board https://edpb.europa.eu/edpb_en .  Its predecessor was called the Article 29 Working Party  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/news.cfm?item_type=1308 . The opinions and  guidelines are also compiled on this site: https://iapp.org/resources/article/all -of-the-european -
63 guidelines in addition to the Data Protection Convention  108, for  instance on big data,235 the police sector236 and profiling.237  Hence, if new legal rules were adopted to mitigate  discrimination risks in the area of AI, perhaps statutory rules  should be combined with a possibility for regulatory bodies to  adopt guidelines  that are easier to amend. There are more  possibilities than statutory law and regulator guidance, such as  co-regulation: self -regulation with varying degrees of influence  of public regul ators. The basic idea remains the same: different  types of rules can be combined.238 As Koops puts it, "Through  multi -level legislation, open -ended formulations and a mixed  approach of abstract and concrete rules that are periodically  evaluated, adequate leg al certainty with respect to current  technologies may be ensured, while at the same time sufficient  scope is given for future technological developments. "239    Of course, there must be democratic legitimacy and sufficient  checks and balances regarding entiti es that set rules or  guidelines . In sum, regulating in the area of new technologies is  hard, but possible – and often necessary.                                                          data-protection -board -and-article -29-working -party -guidelines -opinions -and-documents/ , links  accessed on 10 October 2018.    235 Council of Europe Big Data Guidelines 2017.   236 Council o f Europe Police and Personal Data Guide 2018.   237 Council of Europe, Profiling Recommendation 2010.   238 See Angelopoulos et al. 2016, p. 5 -6; Brown and Marsden 2013.

64 2. ENFORCEMENT   Improving enforcement of current non -discrimination  norms      Regarding discrimination in the area of AI -driven decisions, the  overarching norms are reasonably clear – in our society we do  not, and should not , accept discrimination  on the basis of  protected characteristics such as racial origin. Below are some  suggestions on  enforcement of non-discriminat ion norms i n the  area of AI.   Transparency   As noted, one of the problems with AI systems is the lack of  transparency; their "black box " character.240 The opaqueness  can be seen as a problem in itself – but the opaqueness also  makes it harder to discover discrimination.    Regulation can aim to improve transparency. The law (including  guidelines etc) could, for instance, require that AI systems used  in the public sector are developed in such a way that they  enable auditing  and explainability .241 For the private sector too,  such requirements could be considered.242 There are  precedents for such requirements in the private sector; a  requirement of interpretability exists for certain systems for  algorithmic trading.243  For some types of systems, it could be useful if public sector  bodies release the underlying code (software) . Sometimes,  examining the code  can provide information about how a  system  works. As Rieke, Bogen, and Robinson  note, "code  audits are most likely to be useful when there is a clearly defined  question about how a  software program operates in regulated                                                      240 Pasquale 2015. Se e also Zarsky 2018.   241 See Rieke, Bogen and Robinson 2018, p. 6; Pasquale 2017. See, on auditing AI systems:  Sandvig et al. 2014.   242 See Rieke, Bogen and Robinson 2018, p. 6.   243 See section IV.3; the part about algorithmic trading.  
65 space, and particular standards against which to measure a  system ’s behaviour  or performance. "244 Freedom of information  laws could be adapted so that the code  in AI systems is subject  to such laws. Such an amendment would enable journalists ,  academics and others to obtain and examine such code.   AI systems are often protected by trade secrets, intellectual  property rights or a company ’s terms and conditions.245 Such  protection mak es it harder for regulators, journalists, and  academics to investigate such systems. Perhaps the law should  be adapted to improve research exceptions  and to enable some  types of research. And perhaps the law  should require  organisations to disclose certain  information to researchers  upon request. Such regulation must strike a delicate balance  between public interest in transparency and commercial,  privacy and other interests in opaqueness.246  In many cases, the code alone does not give much information  about an AI system, as the system can only be assessed when  it is used in practice. "For even moderately complex programs, "  observe Rieke, Bogen, and Robinson, "it may be necessary to  see a program run "in the wild, " with real users and data to truly  understand its effects. "247   The law could require the public sector to use only AI systems  that have been  properly assessed for risks  and enable oversight  and auditing .248 A similar requirement could be considered for  the private sector when AI systems are used for certain  decisions, for instance on eligibility for insurance, credit or a  job.249 More research and debate is needed on who should                                                      244 Rieke, Bogen and Robins on 2018, p. 19.   245 See Bodo et al. 2017, p. 171 -175; Malgieri 2016; Wachter and Mittelstadt 2018, p. 63 -77.  246 Similar questions arise in open data versus privacy discussions.

66 conduct such audits. For oversight and auditing of AI systems,  an organisation needs considerable expertise.250    Investigation a nd enforcement powers   Council of Europe member States should ensure that Equality  Bodies  and Data Protection Authorities receive adequate  funding, and that they have sufficient investigation and  enforcement powers.251 Without enforcement, transparency will  not necessarily lead to accountability.252  In sum, Equality Bodies and human rights monitoring bodies   can push for regulation that enables better enforce ment of   current non -discrimination norms in the area of AI decision making. However, AI decision -making also opens the way for   new types of discrimination and differentiation that largely  escape current non-discrimination and other laws. We turn to  that topic now.   3. REGULATING NEW TYPES  OF DIFFERENTIATION   Non-discrimination law and  data protection law leave gaps in  the context of AI.253 Many non -discrimination statutes apply only  to certain protected characteristics, such as race, gender or  sexual orientation.254 The statutes do not apply to discrimination  on the basis of financial stat us for instance . Data protection law  can help to fill some, but definitely not all, gaps in non discrimination law.   AI systems  can escape non-discrimination law  when they  differentiate on the basis of newly invented classes.255 To give  a simplified example: suppose an AI system finds a correlation                                                      250 It has been suggested that a specific oversight body for automated profiling (AI -driven  decision -making) might be useful. See Koops 2008.   251 See ECRI general policy recommendation no. 2 (2018), Article 28.   252 See Kaminski 2018a, p. 21.   253 See section IV.1 and IV.2.   254 Gerards 2007; Khaitan 2015.    255 Custers 2004. See also Mittelstadt et al. 2016.  
67 between (i) using a certain web browser and (ii) a great er  willingness to pay. An online shop could charge higher prices to  people using that browser.256 Such practices would remain  outside the scope of non-discrimina tion law , as a browser type  is not a protected characteristic. (For this hypothe sis we assume  that the browser type is not a proxy for a protected  characteristic) .  AI can r einforc e social inequality   But AI decisions that remain outside the scope of nondiscrimination law  can still lead to differentiation that is unfair or  has other drawbacks. For instance, insurance companies could  use AI systems to set premiums for individual consumers, or to  deny some consumers insurance. To some extent, risk  differentiation is necessary, and an accepted practice, for  insurance. And it can be considered fair when high -risk  customers pay higher premiums.   But there are drawbacks. Too much risk differentiation could  make insurance unaffordable for some consumers and c ould  threaten the risk -pooling function of insurance. Furthermore,  risk differentiation might result in the poor paying more. A  consumer who lives in a poor neighbourhood with many  burglaries might pay more for house insurance, because the risk  of a burgla ry is higher. But if neighbourhoods where many poor  people live have higher risks, then poor people pay, on average,  more.257                                                      256 There is no evidence of such practices, altho ugh from a technical perspective such price  discrimination is easy. There was, however, a travel and booking site that showed more  expensive hotels to Apple users and cheaper ones to PC users (Mattioli 2012).   257 See on AI and insurance: Dutch Association o f Insurers 2016;  Financial Conduct Authority  2016; Peppet 2014; Swedloff 2014. Germany has a specific rule on automated decisions in the  insurance context. See Bundesdatenschutzgesetz vom 30. Juni 2017 (BGBl. I S. 2097),  Section 37 https://www.gesetze -im-internet.de/englisch_bdsg/englisch_bdsg.html#p0310   accessed 13 October 2018. See also Malgieri 2018, p. 9 -11. On discrimination and insurance:  Avraham 2017.  
68 More generally, AI could reinforce social inequality. For  instance, Valentino -De Vries, Singer -Vine and Soltani showed  that some onl ine price differentiation practices in the US had the  effect that people in poor areas paid higher prices. Several  shops charged more to consumers who live in the countryside  than to consumers  in large cit ies.258 In the countryside,  consumers have to drive h ours to visit a competitor. Therefore,  an online shop does not have to use cheap prices; most  customers will not drive for hours to buy the product at a  cheaper price. In a large city, a consumer can easily go to a  competitor to buy a product. Therefore, some online shops  offered cheaper prices in large cities. This pricing scheme had  the effect, probably unintentionally, that poorer people paid, on  average, higher prices, as people tend to be poorer in the  countryside of the US.259 AI can thus  reinforce soci al inequality.  But, as noted, someone ’s financial status is not a protected  characteristic, so non-discrimination law  does not regulate such  a practice  (assuming that the practice does not lead to indirect  discrimination based on a protected characteristic ).260  AI can lead to errors   Non-discrimination law has little to say about incorrect AI  predictions (false positives and false negatives). A problem with  AI decisions is that they are often incorrect for a particular  individual. AI decision -making often enta ils applying a predictive  model to individuals. A simplified example of a predictive model  is: "80% of the people living in postal code   F-67075 pay their bills late. " If, based on this group profile, a  company denies loans to all people in postal code F -67075, it                                                      258 Valentino -De Vries, Singer -Vine and Soltani 2012.   259 Valentino -De Vries, Singer -Vine and Soltani 2012. See on reinforcing inequality and "social  sorting" also Atrey 2018; Danna and Gandy 2002; Lyon 2002; Naudts 2017; Taylor 2017; Turow  2011. Gandy warned 25 y ears ago for the discriminatory effects of large -scale data processing  (Gandy 1993).   260 And in data protection law, data about somebody’s financial status is not among the "special  categories" of data (Article 9 GDPR).  
69 also denies loans to the 20% who pay their bills on time.261 Such  practices could disproportionately harm certain groups in  society. Sometimes, an AI system makes more errors for  minority groups than for the majority.262   New rules?   Additional regulation should be considered, because AI  decision -making that escapes non -discrimination law can still  be unfair. But i t is probably not useful to adopt rules for AI  decision -making in general. AI is used in many different sectors  and for man y purposes, and often, AI does not threaten human   rights.263 An AI system of a chess computer does not bring the  same risks as an AI system for predictive policing.   Even for AI systems that make decisions about humans, the  risks are different in different s ectors, and different rules should  apply. The fairness of AI decision -making cannot be assessed  in the abstract. In each sector, or application area, different  arguments have different weights.264 And in different sectors,  different normative and legal princ iples apply. For instance, the  right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence are  important in the field of criminal law. In consumer transactions,  freedom of contract is an important principle. Hence, when new  rules are considered, such rules need  to focus on specific  sectors.   Whether there is a need for new rules could be assessed as  follows. For a particular sector, several questions should be  answered.   (i)  Which rules apply in this sector, and what are the  rationales for those rules? A rule m ay, for example, aim                                                      261 Zarsky 2002.   262 See, for an example of a system with more errors for minorities: Rieke, Robinson and Yu  2014, p. 12. In such a situation, the AI -driven decisions could be a form of prohibited indirect  discrimination. See also Hardt 2014.   263 See Royal Society 2017, p. 99.    264 Schauer 2003. See also Wachter and Mittelstadt 2018, p. 83.  
70 to protect a human  right, or express a legal principle,  such as equality, contractual freedom, or the right to a  fair trial. Economic rationales also differ from sector to  sector. For instance, risk po oling is important for  insurance, while it is not relevant in most other sectors.  Hence, f or each sector the rationales behind the rules  differ.   (ii)  How is or could AI decision -making be used in this  sector, and what are the risks? For instance, false  positives are a serious problem in t he context of criminal  law. A false positive could lead to people being  questioned, arrested or perhaps even punished. We  should not accept AI decision -making that breaches the  underlying values of criminal law. By contrast: if an  incorrect decision by a n AI system for  price  discrimination makes a consumer pay extra, the effect is  often less harmful than when an incorrect AI decision  leads to  someone  being arrested by the police.   (iii)  Considering the rationales for the rules in this sector,  should the law  be improved in the light of AI decision making? Does AI threaten the law ’s underlying principles  or undermine the law ’s goals? If current law leaves  important risks unaddressed, amendments should be  considered.   In conclusion, new rules may be needed for AI decision -making,  to protect fairness and human  rights such as the right to non discrimination. However, more research and debate are  required on the questions of whether and which rules are  needed.     
71 Empirical and technical research   Information is neces sary for good policy. There is a clear need  for more information about AI-driven discrimination , and hence  for more research.265 Council of Europe member States should  support research – research by human rights monitoring bodies ,  Equality Bodies , and by academics.  More empirical research is  needed  for instance . It is unclear on what scale AI decision making is used. How often does algorithmic decision -making  lead to discrimination (on the basis of racial origin for instance)?  And to other types of unfair differentiation?   More computer science research into solutions is needed too.  For instance, how could AI systems be designed so they respect  and promote human  rights, fairness and accountability? Can  training data be checked for discrimination risks?266 As noted,  an emerging and vibrant field of computer science focuses on  such questions.267 More generally: if countries fund AI research,  part of that funding should be used for research into the risks   for fairness and human rights , and into mitigating th ose risks.    Normative and legal research   There is also a need for public debate, and for n ormative and  legal research. How could the prohibition of indirect  discrimination be enforced more effectively? How should the  law deal with unfair differentiation that re mains outside the  scope of non-discrimination law ? How to define fairness in  diverse sectors ? How should the law (and technology) protect                                                      265 See Wagner et al. 2018, p. 43.   266 See Campolo et al. 2018, p. 1   267 https://www.fatml.org  accessed 2 October 2018.  
72 people against intersectional268 and structural discrimination ?269  Should the law protect some types of "group privacy ", and  how?270 How to safeguard the rule of law when AI systems  make decisions about people?271 Which types of decisions, if  any, should never be taken by computers? How could data  protection law be used in practice to fight discrimination? Are  new rules needed, or are tweaks to non-discrimination law  and  data protection law sufficient? Which tweaks would be needed?  Which new rules would be needed?   VII. CONCLUSION   In conclusion, AI offers many exciting possibilities to improve  our societies. But AI decision -making also brings risks  – it is  often opaque and can have discriminatory effects, for instance  when an AI system learns from data reflecting biased human  decisions.   In the public and the private sector, o rganisations can take AI driven decisions  with far -reaching effects for people. Public  sector bodies can use AI for predictive policing or sentencing  recommendations, and for decisions on, for instance , pensions,  housing assistance or unemployment benefits. The private  sector can also take AI dec isions with major consequences  for  people, such as decisions regarding employment, housing or  credit. Moreover,  many small decisions , taken together,  can  have large effects. One targeted ad vertisement  is rarely a major  problem, but when  aggregate d, targete d advertising may  exclude some groups. And AI-driven price differentiation could  lead to certain groups in society consistently paying more.                                                       268 See on intersectional discrimination : Crenshaw 1989; Fredman 2016.

73 The most relevant legal instruments to mitigate the risks of  AIdriven discrimination are non -discrimination law an d data  protection law. If effectively enforced, both legal instruments  could help to fight illegal discrimination. Council of Europe  member States , human rights monitoring bodies, such as the  European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, and  Equality  Bodies should aim for better enforcement of current  non-discrimination norms .   But AI also paves the way for  new types of unfair differentiation  (or discrimination) that escape current laws . Most non discrimination statutes only apply to discrimination on the basis  of protected characteristics, such as racial origin. Such  statutes  do not apply if organisations differentiate on the basis of newly  invented classes  that do not correlate with prot ected  characteristic s. Such differentiation could still be unfair,  however, for instance  when it reinforces social inequality. We  probably need additional regulation to protect fairness and  human  rights in the area of AI. But regulating AI in general is no t  the right approach, as the use of AI systems is too varied for  one set of rules. We need sector -specific rules, because  different values are at stake , and different problems arise,  in  different sectors. More debate and interdisciplinary research are  need ed. If we make the right choices now, we can enjoy the  many benefits of AI, while minimising the risks of unfair  discrimination.
