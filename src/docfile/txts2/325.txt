3 AI is everywhere and affects everyone – from our social media feeds to the  social benefits we receive.  Thanks to technology, we receive the information we are most interested  in. Administrative decisions can be made more efficiently. Vaccines can  be developed faster than before. But as decisions become increasingly  automated, it is vital that technology works for us and not against us – or against some of us.  The risks are vast. Think about the now infamous case where hundreds  of innocent families were falsely accused of having committed fraud and  forced to return social benefits. Many of these families had an immigration  background. This was a demonstration of what the use of a biased algorithm  can ultimately lead to. This only underlines that technology needs to be regulated so that we can  harness its astonishing potential. We have to look under the hood and understand how algorithms really work,  so we all become more aware of the risks when engaging with it. In this report, we set out to lift the curtain and show how algorithms work  in practice. We developed and tested algorithmic models in the areas of  offensive speech detection and predictive policing. We quickly found that automated hate speech detection is unreliable. Harmless  phrases such as ‘I am Jewish’ or ‘I am Muslim’ may get flagged as offensive.  And yet offensive content may easily slip through. We also looked at automated predictive policing. And we found that algorithms  can generate mistaken information. Essentially sending the police to the wrong  parts of the city. This should be a major concern for often under-resourced police forces using this technology.  Our tests highlight how easily algorithms can be biased or develop bias over  time. And this can lead to discrimination.  This does not mean that we need to abolish or stop investing in artificial  intelligence. It means that humans still have an important role to play. We  need to understand how well algorithms work, what the biases are and  stay very closely involved in monitoring AI. And we need to always test the  applications in the context of their use. In some contexts, algorithms can help  us a great deal. In others, they may not at all be fit for purpose.  It is high time to dispel the myth that human rights block us from going  forward. More human rights mean more trustworthy technology. More  trustworthy technology is a more attractive technology. In the long run it  will also be the more successful technology.Foreword
4 If we get this right, I look forward to a future with cures for diseases that are  beyond our dreams right now. I look at the delivery of public services to a  degree of efficiency and quality which simply is not the case today.  If we move into the right direction, it is astonishing what we could achieve.  So, let us work together on getting this right. Michael O’Flaherty  Director

7 Key findings and FRA opinions Artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms affect people everywhere: from  deciding what content people see on their social media feeds to determining  who will receive state benefits. AI technologies are typically based on algorithms that make predictions to  support or even fully automate decision-making. Among the main goals of  using AI in this way are increasing efficiency and operating systems at a  large scale. But, a central question, and a fundamental rights concern, is what happens if  algorithms become biased against certain groups of people, such as women  or immigrants? As research from the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) highlights, the  use of AI can affect many fundamental rights. While algorithms can be a force  for good, they can also violate the right to privacy or lead to discriminatory decision-making, which has a very real impact on people’s lives. A cautionary tale about the possible negative effects of biased algorithms in  practice comes from the Netherlands. In 2020, it came to light that the Dutch  tax authorities had used algorithms that mistakenly labelled around 26,000  parents as having committed fraud in their childcare benefit applications. Many  of these parents had an immigration background. They were required to pay  back large sums, which led to great financial and psychological difficulties  for the families concerned. The data protection authority concluded that the  processing of data by the AI system in use was discriminatory.1 Despite the recent sharper focus on the problem of bias in algorithms, this  area still lacks a tangible evidence base that employs technical assessments  of algorithms in practice and their outcomes. How exactly AI can lead to  fundamental rights violations is not yet fully known. More evidence-based assessments are urgently needed to fill this gap. This  report seeks to contribute to this through its focus on ‘use cases’ of algorithmic  modelling. ‘Use case’ is a term used in software engineering among other  fields. This report loosely defines it as the specific application of a technology  for a certain goal used by a specified actor. It shows how bias can occur in  algorithms and how that bias relates to potential discrimination. It highlights  the complexities of bias detection and assessment of potential discrimination,  illustrating that bias occurs at several stages, and in different ways.Although, as this report demonstrates, there is no ‘quick fix’ for addressing  bias in algorithms, it is clear that there needs to be a system for assessing  and mitigating bias before and while using algorithms in practice. Looking at the two use cases in this report, the questions that need to be  addressed include the following:  ËWhat if the police are repeatedly sent to certain neighbourhoods based on algorithms, despite faulty crime predictions?  ËWhat if legitimate content posted online by or about certain groups gets deleted more often than others? This report explores these questions based on original research, combining  empirical evidence from the development and testing of algorithms with 
8 fundamental rights discussions considering current policy developments. It is  based on simulation experiments and analysis conducted to uncover examples  of bias in algorithms. Two particular ‘use cases’ are discussed in the report:  Ëpredictive policing  – testing a simplified version of a fully automated  predictive policing algorithm in relation to crime occurrence in  neighbourhoods, focusing on feedback loops (as defined in the following  section);  Ëoffensive speech detection – the development of algorithms to detect  offensive speech, which were then tested for ethnic and gender bias. The European Commission’s proposal of April 2021 for an AI act (AIA) reflects  the increased policy and legislative focus on AI.2 The proposal contains  provisions relevant to the protection of fundamental rights. These provisions  include requirements for risk management (Article 9), including with respect  to fundamental rights, and a conformity assessment for high-risk AI systems  (Article 43). Notably, with respect to the focus of this report, the proposed  AIA also includes a legal basis for the processing of sensitive data to detect,  monitor and correct bias that could lead to discrimination (Article 10 (5)).  At the time of writing this report, negotiations around the proposed AIA  were ongoing. Fundamental rights protection plays an important role in the negotiations and discussions around the AIA. 3 The report aims to inform policymakers, human rights practitioners and the  general public about risk of bias when using AI, thereby feeding into ongoing  policy developments. It is acknowledged that bias can be understood in  different ways. This analysis investigates bias in the context of nondiscrimination, which is one of the key concerns regarding fundamental  rights-compliant AI. The findings pinpoint ways to detect and counteract  forms of bias that may lead to discrimination, with the ultimate goal of using  AI algorithms in a way that respects fundamental rights. Considering the development of bias in algorithms over time:  ‘Feedback loops’ The first use case discussed in this report is a simulation of a feedback loop in  the area of predictive policing. A feedback loop occurs when predictions made  by a system influence the data that are used to update the same system. It  means that algorithms influence algorithms, because their recommendations  and predictions influence the reality on the ground. This reality then becomes  the basis for data collection to update algorithms. Therefore, the output of  the system becomes the future input into the very same system. Any bias in algorithms can therefore potentially be reinforced over time and  exacerbated. Feedback loops can lead to extreme results that overestimate  realities – so-called runaway feedback loops – which is particularly problematic  when applied to ‘high-risk’ AI applications in the field of law enforcement, for example in the area of predictive policing. The first use case simulates  a predictive policing algorithm and demonstrates that several factors can  contribute to the formation of feedback loops, including low and varying  crime reporting rates, different rates of crime detection and improper use of machine learning. These three  factors that contribute to the formation  of feedback loops are summarised below.Test algorithms for bias before and after deploying  them, considering their impact over time, and provide  guidance on how to collect data on sensitive attributes �
9 First, data quality can have an impact on feedback loops.  FRA’s analysis shows that, for predictive policing, low and  varying rates of reporting by victims or witnesses can lead  to the creation of biased feedback loops. For example,  if predictions of crime rates are based on low reporting  rates that fail to reflect the reality of crime occurrence,  or the ‘true crime rate’, this can lead to false predictions and wrong policy decisions. FRA has repeatedly provided evidence showing low  levels of reporting to the police and other authorities in  relation to people’s experiences of discrimination and  crime based on their gender, ethnicity, age and religious  background, among other factors. Such reporting rates  are influenced by victims’ personal characteristics and  socio-economic background, as shown in the FRA report  on crime, safety and victims’ rights4 and in the FRA report  on the results of the second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey, 5 the latter of which includes  crime reporting rates among different ethnic minority and  immigrant groups. This evidence challenges the accuracy  of official data sources used for crime predictions. Second, the detection of different types of crime varies,  which can also influence data. For example, some crimes  are easier to detect and record. An example of such a  crime is car theft, which people have an incentive to  report in order to make an insurance claim. Other crimes  are not so easy to detect, for example fraud and other  financial crimes. Certain population groups may be more often associated with crimes that are  easier to detect. This may lead to biased predictions over time, as predictions  are overly focused on types of crime that are more readily recorded by the  police. In addition, the police may behave differently in neighbourhoods that  are assumed to have higher crime rates. An increased sense of vigilance  among the police in such neighbourhoods may lead to an increase in observed  crimes, which can also lead to biased crime records. Third, in addition to data quality, machine learning algorithms tend to put too  much weight on training data. The simulations in the first use case looked  at in this report show that a runaway feedback loop (as defined above)  occurs more quickly in machine learning models if they are not controlled for  overreacting to small signals and differences in the data. As a consequence,  the use of techniques for avoiding exaggerated predictions, which mirror  training data too strongly (so-called overfitting), are necessary for any  algorithm development.FRA OPINION 1 Users of predictive algorithms need  to assess the quality of training data and other sources that influence bias  and may lead to discrimination � Such  bias and potential discrimination  may be developed or amplified over time, when data based on outputs of  algorithmic systems become the basis  for updated algorithms �  Consequently,  algorithms that are used to make  or support decisions about people,  such as predictive policing, need to  be assessed before and regularly  after deployment �  Special attention  needs to be paid to the use of machine  learning algorithms and automated  decision-making � The EU legislator should make sure  that regular assessments by providers  and users are mandatory and part of  the risk assessment and management  requirements for high-risk algorithms �
10 The development of bias in algorithms over time through  such feedback loops risks reinforcing or creating dis criminatory practices that affect groups with protected  characteristics (such as ethnic origin) disproportionate ly. To assess potentially disproportionate ‘overpolicing’ of certain groups, assessments of outputs (algorithmic  predictions) are needed with respect to the composition  of the target groups.FRA OPINION 2 To better understand how bias can lead to discrimination, data on  protected characteristics may need  to be collected by users of AI systems  to enable assessment of potential  discrimination � T his data collection  needs to be justified, based on strict necessity and should include  safeguards in relation to the protection  and use of these data � Article 10 (5) of  the proposed AIA can provide clarity on the lawful processing of sensitive  data that are strictly necessary to detect, monitor and, potentially,  mitigate or prevent bias and  discrimination � Such a clear legal basis  can contribute to better detection,  monitoring, prevention and mitigation  efforts when using algorithms,  but it should be accompanied by  appropriate safeguards, including  aspects such as anonymisation,  pseudonymisation and appropriate  limitations with respect to collection,  storage, accessibility and retention �  Additional implementing guidance on  the collection of sensitive data under  Article 10 (5) should be considered,  notably with respect to the use of  proxies and outlining the protected  grounds (such as ethnic origin or  sexual orientation) that need to be  covered �
11 Uncovering biases in language prediction tools The second use case discussed in this report is a simulation  of online hate speech detection systems. Offensive and  hate speech detection algorithms, which are currently  used in practice, are based on advanced machine learning  methodologies and natural language processing (NLP).  Given the sheer magnitude of online content, major online  platforms have considerably increased their efforts to  automatically detect or ‘predict’ potential online hatred,  and have developed tools to do this. However, such tools  can produce biased results for several reasons. Most notably, the level of hatred associated with different  identity terms (i.e. words indicating group identities)  varies considerably across the data and models that  form the basis of the tools. For example, sentences  using the term ‘Jew’ in English-language models lead  to a much greater increase in the predicted level of  offensiveness than the term ‘Christian’ . This leads to  differences with respect to the predictions of offensive  speech for different groups. Those differences can also  lead to wrong predictions and classifications. Several algorithms for offensive speech detection were  specifically developed for this report, based on different  methodologies and for different languages – English,  German and Italian – and subsequently tested for bias.  The outcomes show that some terms lead considerably  more often to predictions of text as being offensive. For  example, in English, the use of terms alluding to ‘Muslim’,  ‘gay’ or ‘Jew’ often lead to predictions of generally  non-offensive text phrases as being offensive. In the  German-language algorithms developed for this report,  the terms ‘Muslim’, ‘foreigner’ and ‘Roma’ most often lead  to predictions of text as being offensive despite being  non-offensive. In the Italian-language algorithms, the  terms ‘Muslims’, ‘Africans’, ‘Jews’, ‘foreigners’, ‘Roma’ and  ‘Nigerians’ trigger overly strong predictions in relation  to offensiveness. Such bias clearly points to language differences in  predictions of ‘offensiveness’ for different groups by  ethnic origin, which means that people who use such  phrases are treated differently. Such biased flagging and  blocking practices can, for example, lead to differences  in access to communication services based on ethnicity.  For example, a Jewish person may use the term ‘Jew’  more often in the online content they post, which may be more readily flagged as offensive and be removed. One of the reasons for these results is that these terms are  strongly linked to online hatred captured in the ‘training data’ (text datasets including examples of hatred) used  for creating the algorithms. The predictions frequently  ‘overreact’ to such terms, flagging text that is usually Ethnic and gender biases in speech detection  and prediction models are strong, and need to be  assessed when deploying algorithms � FRA OPINION 3 The EU legislator should ensure  that assessments of discrimination  are mandatory when deploying NLP-based systems such as hate  speech detection systems �  A  context-sensitive and gender-based  assessment of potential discrimination  is necessary, highlighting potential  under- and over-flagging of content �   An evidence-driven assessment is needed when testing for bias in  algorithms � The implementation of EU law, such  as the Digital Services Act (DSA) and  the proposed AIA, should safeguard  against discrimination, for example  through provisions requiring providers and users of algorithms  to provide documentation and  carry out assessments in relation to  discrimination � With the requirement  for increased transparency and  assessments of algorithms being  the first step towards safeguarding  against discrimination, companies and  public bodies using speech detection  should be required to share the  information necessary to assess bias with relevant oversight bodies and –  to the extent possible – publicly � Oversight bodies relevant for  protecting fundamental rights, such  as equality bodies and data protection  authorities, should pay close attention  to the potential discrimination in language-based prediction models  when exercising their mandates �
12 not actually offensive as offensive. This is the result of such terms often  being considered offensive in training data (i.e. the data used to build the  algorithms) – that is, this phenomenon reflects the strong presence of hatred  against these groups in the training data. Furthermore, in the English-language data, the analysis finds a correlation  between offensiveness predictions of an algorithm and the likelihood the  text uses African American English (which refers to a version of English  frequently used by black people in the United States). This correlation may lead to a higher likelihood of African American English text being predicted  as being offensive, even if it is not. Algorithms can also exhibit bias in relation to the gender categories of certain  terms. The gender categories of terms were investigated for the German-  and Italian-language data, as these languages use gendered nouns. The  analysis shows that available language models (pre-trained AI algorithms  based on a large amount of text) can lead to gender bias. This bias can lead  to differential predictions, for example by considering the feminine version  of a term more offensive than its masculine counterpart, or vice versa. For  example, the feminine version of ‘Muslim’ in Italian (‘ Musulmana ’) is rated by  the models more negatively than its masculine counterpart (‘Musulmano’). This also reflects intersectional hatred, as the rating is based on gender in  combination with ethnic origin or religion. This highlights the challenge of  using NLP with gendered languages. These results show how easily bias in relation to protected characteristics can  creep into algorithms and can lead to discrimination. Such biases may already  exist in off-the-shelf general-purpose AI models, which can be adapted for a  specific purpose and are used in fields such as text classification or machine  translation. These are based on models that have learned universal language  representations based on large amounts of text, and can be adapted for  specific purposes, as has been done for this report. Importantly, as the results  of the second use case demonstrate, such algorithms cannot be readily used  for automated content moderation of hate speech, as they take words linked  to protected characteristics – in isolation and out of context – as indications of the presence of offensive speech.
13 The obligation to respect the principle of nondiscrimination is enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on  European Union (TEU), Article 10 of the Treaty on the  Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (requiring the  Union to combat discrimination on a number of grounds)  and Articles 20 and 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental  Rights (equality before the law and non-discrimination  based on a non-exhaustive list of grounds). All prohibited  grounds of discrimination as listed in the Charter are  relevant when it comes to the use of algorithms. More specific and detailed provisions in several EU  directives also enshrine this principle, with varying scopes  of application. The proposed equal treatment directive6  would provide even more protection for several grounds  of discrimination, as it fills specific gaps.FRA OPINION 4 The EU’s anti-discrimination legislation  is crucial for safeguarding a high  level of equality in the EU �  The  present analysis shows that speech  algorithms include strong bias against  people based on many different  characteristics, such as ethnic origin,  gender, religion and sexual orientation �  As a consequence, the EU legislator  and Member States should strive to  ensure consistent and high levels of  protection against discrimination on  all grounds, including (at a minimum)  sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion  or belief, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and  gender expression in different areas  of life �  This discrimination should be  tackled using various existing laws  that safeguard fundamental rights �  In addition to non-discrimination  legislation, existing data protection  laws should also be used to address  non-discrimination regarding the use  of algorithms for decision-making � The requirements for high-risk AI use  cases – as included in the proposed  AIA – should increase transparency  and allow for the assessment of  discrimination of algorithms �  This  information, with respect to AI use cases, can be used to enforce  existing non-discrimination and data  protection laws � Finally, equality bodies should step up  their efforts to address discrimination  complaints and cases linked to the  use of algorithms �  In order to do  this effectively, they should employ  specialised staff and cooperate with  data protection authorities and other  relevant oversight bodies �
14 Striving for more language diversity While NLP technologies and the availability of related  tools for English have improved considerably in recent  years, NLP tools for other languages are lagging far  behind. This report uncovered a clear imbalance between  the tools and knowledge available for NLP technologies  for English and those available for other languages. For EU  languages, such as German and Italian, results revealed  the quantity and quality of available data and NLP tools  to be insufficient, resulting in reduced performance of  the algorithms detecting offensive speech, while also  exhibiting strong levels of bias.There is a need to promote language diversity in tools  available for natural language processing � FRA OPINION 5 The EU and its Member States should  consider measures to foster more  language diversity in NLP tools as a  way of mitigating bias in algorithms  and improving the accuracy of data �  As a first step, this should include  promoting and funding NLP research  on a range of EU languages other  than English in order to promote the  use of properly tested, documented  and maintained language tools for all  official EU languages � The EU and its Member States should  also consider building a repository  of data for bias testing in NLP �  Such  a repository should conform to EU  standards of data protection, contain high-quality data in all EU languages  to enable testing for biases and be  continually updated and maintained �
15 Increase access to resources needed for  evidence-based oversight of algorithms The differences in bias in algorithms found in this project  differ not only across languages but also across the tools  and methodologies used. Some AI models are based on  algorithms that were developed for general language  detection and prediction tasks based on large bodies  of text. Such ‘pre-developed’ models are needed for  speech detection algorithms in many cases. The research  found that bias differed depending on which tools were  used. This means that bias is already embedded in predeveloped general-purpose speech models, which are  often developed by large companies with access to  vast amounts of data and computing power. Assessing  and documenting bias in such pre-developed models  is challenging in the absence of full documentation  and available tests for identifying bias in such tools. In  addition, datasets are often difficult to obtain. This is  partly because NLP researchers are overly cautious and avoid sharing data, often because they lack knowledge  of data protection rules.There is a need to increase knowledge, awareness and  resources for bias testing of algorithms � FRA OPINION 6 To increase the application of  trustworthy AI, compliant with  fundamental rights, more EU and national funding for fundamental  rights assessments of existing  software and algorithms is needed to  support studies of available generalpurpose algorithms �  This would help  deployers and users of AI tools to more  easily conduct their own fundamental  rights impact assessments before and  during the use of certain AI systems � The EU and its Member States should  improve access to data and data  infrastructures for identifying and  combating the risk of bias in algorithmic  systems �  This includes ensuring access  to data infrastructures for EU-based  researchers �  This could be achieved  through investment in cloud computing  and storage infrastructures, designed in  accordance with EU standards for data  protection, software safety and energy  efficiency �  EU-based researchers should  be granted access to such infrastructure  to foster public scrutiny � In this respect, Article 40 DSA allows  for researchers to better access data  from online platforms �  This article  should be used to the extent possible,  without bureaucratic obstacles, to  allow easy and widespread access to  data needed for – the sole purpose  of – bias- and discrimination-related  research on online platforms’ conduct � To further improve availability of evidence of bias, the European  Commission, the European Data  Protection Board and the European  Data Protection Supervisor should  look at the need to address issues  of correctly implementing data  protection law in relation to data  sharing with respect to sensitive data  for the purpose of researching and  monitoring discrimination � Without  clearer guidance, misinterpretation of  data protection law may unnecessarily  stand in the way of independent  evidence-based oversight of the risk  of bias in algorithms �

17 Algorithms are used to automate many tasks that affect our lives, often on a  scale that cannot be matched by work undertaken by humans. Algorithms that  can predict, label, analyse and recommend have opened up new horizons and  can support decision-making across many domains. They hold the promise  of huge benefits to the economy and society at large. Alongside benefits, however, algorithms also pose risks to fundamental rights.  Therefore, it is essential for those responsible for the development and use of  algorithms to examine their possible impact on people and their fundamental  rights. This balancing act between innovation and fundamental rights is also  at the heart of EU policy efforts to regulate AI and related technologies. FRA has pointed out in previous reports on AI and big data that only a  rights-based approach guarantees a high level of protection against possible  wrongdoing related to new technologies.7 One such potential wrongdoing  – and the subject of this report – involves the risk of bias in algorithms: the  tendency for algorithms to produce outputs that lead to a disadvantage for  certain groups, such as women, ethnic minorities or people with a disability. This is not an imaginary problem, but one with real-world effects. In the  Netherlands, for example, the tax authorities used algorithms that mistakenly  labelled around 26,000 parents as having committed fraud in their childcare  benefit applications. A disproportionate number of these parents had an  immigration background. They were required to pay back large sums, which led  to great financial and psychological difficulties for the families concerned. The data protection  authority concluded that the processing of data  by the AI system in use was discriminatory.8 The  scandal has become a cautionary tale about  the impact on people of decisions made (or  supported) by biased algorithms. So how do these AI systems/algorithms become  ‘biased’? The general answer is simple enough:  the bias itself and the resulting discrimination is pervasive in society, rooted in psychological,  social and cultural dynamics, and hence reflected  in the data and texts that are used for developing  AI models. The use of algorithms to support  decision-making processes is often portrayed  as rational and neutral. But machines and  technology are not neutral, because they are  developed and used by humans. Where bias is  present in human decision-making, it may be  transferred to machines.Imagine living in a neighbourhood  with a very strong police presence  and being stopped and searched  on the streets, perhaps frequently. Are the reasons behind the police presence based on correct and  representative facts, and what role  – if any – does the police’s new AI-based crime prevention tool play in this? Does bias play a role? Imagine you are from a certain  religious community and an active  social media user, but several posts  mentioning your religion are taken down by the platform as potentially offensive. Is this something people with a different (or no) religious  background also experience, and to  what extent?How could  biased algorithms affect your day-to-day life?1 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND BIAS:  WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
18 The question of exactly how bias creeps into the predictions of algorithms –  the topic of this report – requires a more complex answer. The two situations  mentioned in the box above – being stopped by the police and having social  media posts about one’s own religion deleted – are central to the case studies  in this report. Algorithms used for predictive policing and for offensive speech  detection were tested to clearly illustrate how and where bias may occur  and when it leads to discrimination. The term ‘algorithm’ is widely used in the context of big data, machine learning and  AI. In computer science, an algorithm is a sequence of commands for a computer to transform an input into an output. A sequence of commands to sort a random list of  people according to age is one example of an algorithm. In that example, we provide  a computer with the random list (input), execute the algorithm (commands) and the computer produces a list sorted by age (output). Algorithms are often used to make predictions, for example predictions regarding  the profile of people who are likely to buy a certain product, the weather forecast or  spam detection. For a specific task, an algorithm is fed with data; this creates a model  that is used in practice for a real-world task. Following common machine learning terminology, an algorithm is the ‘raw’ state, and the model is what you get when the  algorithm has been ‘trained’ on data. The term ‘artificial intelligence’ is more difficult to define. ‘AI’ does not refer to a  single, tangible thing but to current technological developments and processes in general. Most of what is discussed under the umbrella of ‘AI’ refers to the increased automation of tasks through the use of machine learning and automated decisionmaking. At the core of current AI discussions and machine learning applications  lies the use of algorithms. FRA’s Getting the future right report* includes a broader  discussion of AI and related terms. Efforts to clarify the definition of AI include work by the European Commission’s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence and the OECD.**Algorithms,  models and artificial intelligence * FRA (2020), Getting  the future right –  Artificial intelligence and fundamental rights, Luxembourg, Publications Office. ** OECD (2022), OECD  Framework for the Classification of AI systems , OECD Digital  Economy Papers, No. 323, Paris, OECD Publishing. 
19 1 .1. WHY THIS REPORT? At the time of writing, the EU is striving to become the first regional actor  to regulate AI using a dedicated legal instrument. The EU has set out to  play a “leading role in setting the global gold standard”9 when it comes to  addressing the risks generated by specific uses of AI, while at the same time  assisting EU Member States in their transitions to digital societies, including  promoting the development and uptake of AI in the EU. As FRA stressed in its Getting the future right  report,10 only concrete examples  allow for a thorough examination of whether, and to what extent, using  technology interferes with fundamental rights and whether any such  interference can be justified, in line with the principles of necessity and  proportionality. Such concrete examples need to be evidence based. While  availability of evidence and data on fundamental rights implications of  using algorithms and AI has increased in recent years, there is still a lack  of evidence in relation to how and where bias occurs and when it leads  to discrimination. A recent study by the European Parliamentary Research Service emphasised  that, as AI is created by humans, it can be susceptible to bias. This bias “most  frequently occurs when machine learning applications are trained on data that  only reflect certain demographic groups, or which reflect societal biases.”11  The same study highlights the additional challenge that AI applications are  often ‘black boxes’, making it impossible for the consumer to judge whether  the data used to train them are fair and representative, which in turn makes  biases hard to detect and mitigate.12 Determining where bias comes from is therefore a challenging exercise. In  addition, there are many different kinds and notions of biases, not all of which  are necessarily negative or harmful (see Section 1.2). As FRA’s previous reports  have highlighted, algorithms are only as good as the data that are used to  develop them.13 In practice, poor-quality and/or biased data often all too  easily slip into algorithmic processes, rendering them flawed and potentially  discriminatory. There are also other sources of bias. Algorithms may be trained  on data that are not necessarily biased, but are unrepresentative. In this case,  the data used for such algorithms cannot be used to make generalisations  about other groups. For example, if a face detection algorithm is trained  using predominantly male faces, its predictions might be problematic when applied to female faces. 14 This report looks under the hood of algorithms in the context of two particular  ‘use cases’ (see the next section) to demonstrate some sources of bias.  The report also firmly places the discussion of bias in the context of nondiscrimination. Discrimination is a negative result of bias, which needs to be prevented. Regarding this, FRA adds unique findings from original applied  research to underpin the much-needed body of evidence on bias and AI ,  while suggesting concrete steps to counter such bias. As questions of how bias can be detected and counteracted in AI applications are at the centre of  discussions around regulating AI, these findings can help point policymakers  to potential safeguards and mitigation strategies to avoid unwanted bias and  discrimination in AI technologies. This report is intended to be read by policymakers working on AI and  providers and users of AI. The results of the report are also relevant to  human rights practitioners and academics dealing with the topic of new  technologies and fundamental rights. Finally, the report informs the general  public about the risks of bias when using AI. 
20 FRA’s first report on the subject of AI was published in 2018.* It highlighted  the fact that algorithms are only as good as the data they are fed. If the data are outdated, incorrect, incomplete or poorly selected, results too will be  questionable. With endless amounts of data being so quickly produced on the  internet, the lack of quality control regarding how these data are produced and then used is a serious concern. A further FRA focus paper published in 2019** reemphasised the risk that AI  systems based on incomplete or biased data can lead to inaccurate outcomes  that infringe on people’s fundamental rights, including non-discrimination. It  also explored the importance of using high-quality data to ensure high-quality algorithms, including the need for developers and providers of algorithms to be transparent about which data are used in AI systems in order to help prevent  possible fundamental rights violations. As one highly relevant area of AI, fundamental rights considerations in the  context of law enforcement in relation to facial recognition technology were dealt with in a 2019 FRA report.*** The report provides an overview of  what the technology is, how law enforcement authorities (plan to) use the  technology and what the main fundamental rights concerns are in relation to its use. In a 2020 report, FRA highlighted some concrete examples of bias in  algorithms.**** In addition to highlighting the need for further studies of potential discrimination resulting from the use of AI systems, some professionals FRA interviewed for this report underscored that results from complex machine  learning algorithms are often very difficult to understand and explain. This leads  to the conclusion that further research to better understand and explain such results (‘explainable AI’) could also help to better detect discrimination when using AI.What has FRA  done in this area to date? * FRA (2018a), #BigData:  Discrimination in datasupported decision making, Luxembourg, Publications Office. ** FRA (2019), Data quality  and artificial intelligence – Mitigating bias and error to protect fundamental rights, Luxembourg, Publications Office. *** FRA (2019), Facial recognition  technology: Fundamental rights considerations in the context of  law enforcement, Luxembourg,  Publications Office. **** FRA (2020), Getting  the future right – Artificial intelligence and fundamental rights, Luxembourg, Publications Office.

21 What does this report cover? FRA gathered evidence for this report by engaging with two practical examples  of the use of algorithms in order to get a better understanding of the extent  of potential bias, and to assess the legal implications, particularly with respect  to fundamental rights. The overall design of the research was developed  by FRA and conducted by a consortium of data scientists and lawyers led  by Rania Wazir. Based on the findings, FRA carried out further analysis and  drafted this report. The two use cases covered the following examples. The first example (elaborated on in Chapter 2) analyses how algorithms can  exacerbate bias over time, often referred to as the formation of runaway  feedback loops . It is based on a simulation study applied to the example  of predictive policing  contexts. A feedback loop occurs when decisions  based on predictions made by an AI system influence the data that are  then used to retrain or update the system. So-called runaway feedback  loops not only perpetuate biases in the data, but can also actually increase  them. For example, if police forces are advised to monitor one area based  on predictions that are influenced by biased crime records, then police will  detect more crime in that area. The second example (elaborated on in Chapter 3) analyses ethnic and gender  biases in offensive speech detection  algorithms . Algorithms were developed  based on real-life offensive speech datasets, using different approaches,  including pre-trained AI models. The models were developed for English-,  German- and Italian-language datasets. These models were then tested  against invented phrases to see how the predictions change for different  terms related to ethnic groups and gender. For example, the sentence ‘I hate  […]’ was used, where ‘[…]’ was populated with various terms for groups (e.g.  African, European) to see which terms trigger more offensive predictions. Chapters 2 and 3 present the main findings that emerged from the analysis of  these two use cases. The remainder of this chapter presents a brief outline of the policy context and legal framework relating to biased algorithms and  non-discrimination. 1.2. AR TIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, BIAS AND  FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS: POLICY CONTEXT EU institutions have become increasingly engaged in the area of AI, bias  and other fundamental rights considerations with respect to policy positions  and, more recently, legislative proposals. In 2017, a European Parliament  resolution on fundamental rights implications of big data called for the strong  enforcement of fundamental rights in relation to new technologies.15 The  European Council called for a European approach to AI and emphasised in its  strategic guidelines for 2019–2024 the need to “ensure that Europe is digitally  sovereign” and for policy to be “shaped in a way that embodies our societal  values”.16 The European Commission published its 2018 communication on AI  for Europe,17 established the High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence  and committed to putting forward legislation “for a coordinated European  approach on the human and ethical implications of [AI]”.18 In February 2020,  the European Commission published a white paper on AI, setting out policy options for meeting the twin objectives of “promoting the uptake of AI and  addressing the risks associated with certain uses of this new technology”. 19
22 On 21 April 2021, the Commission published  its proposal for an AIA.20 Negotiations on the  AIA proposal were ongoing in the European  Parliament and Council at the time of writing  this report. The AIA proposal – with provisions  regulating different risk categories of AI  applications – forms part of the European  Commission’s digital strategy , and is a key step  in the EU’s endeavour to make its law fit for  the digital age. The AIA proposal is part of a  tranche of proposals that must be understood in tandem, including the DSA (with provisions  on recommender systems and a risk assessment  in relation to fundamental rights, expressly  mentioning the prohibition of discrimination,  by very large online platforms), the digital markets act (with provisions on AI-relevant  hardware, operating systems and software  distribution), the draft machinery regulation  (revising the Machinery Directive21 in relation to  AI, health and safety, and machinery), the draft  data governance act (concerning data-sharing  frameworks) and the revision of the Product  Liability Directive22 in relation to AI. 1.3. BIAS IN ALGORITHMS AND  NON-DISCRIMINATION Biases in algorithmic systems may lead to  discrimination. They also have the potential to  amplify discrimination because of their potential  scale of application or because of feedback  loops.23 However, it is important to distinguish  between bias and discrimination.Globalpolicy.AI is a platform  involving eight intergovernmental organisations with complementary  mandates that cooperate to help  policymakers and the public navigate the international AI governance landscape and access the necessary  know-how and tools to inform AI  policy development. The Globalpolicy.AI initiative  launched in September 2021. The intergovernmental organisations  currently involved are the  Council of Europe, the European Commission, FRA, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD), the United  Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Bank  Group. It highlights international efforts such  as the Council of Europe’s efforts to  create an international instrument  to regulate AI and UNESCO’s recommendation on the ethics of AI.

23 The term ‘bias’ can have a different meaning depending on the context in which it is  used and the particular discipline it comes from, for example law or computer science. It is therefore important to clarify its meaning in the context of this report. Bias can  refer to any of the following.  ―Differential treatment based on protected characteristics, such as discrimination  and bias-motivated crimes. This refers to an inclination for or against a person or group based on protected characteristics, such as ethnic origin, gender,  religion, colour or sexual orientation. Discrimination defines a situation in which  an individual is disadvantaged in some way on the basis of ‘one or multiple protected grounds’. Crimes committed with a bias motivation are a particularly severe example of a result of biases against people based on their (assumed)  characteristics.* Such definitions are often used in legal contexts and the social  sciences.  ―Differentiation. Bias understood in this sense is necessary for the proper functioning of a statistical or machine learning algorithm. For example, a machine learning model that has to differentiate between oranges and pears has to have  bias towards labelling round, orange objects as oranges. Such use of bias is mainly  found in computer science and machine learning.  ―Statistical bias. This refers to the systematic difference between an estimated parameter and its true value. Statistical bias exists when data are not adequately measuring what they are intended to measure. For example, gross domestic  product per capita is not necessarily a good measure of the standard of living in  a country, as it does not account for inequality of income distribution. In addition, data and the resulting statistical estimates may not be representative of the target population. For example, if a sample of the general population contains more men  than women, it is said to be biased towards men. Bias is mainly understood in this  way in statistics.  ―Offset from origin. In the context of deep learning, bias is also the name for an estimated parameter. The fixed number indicating the average baseline estimate in the linear weight functions of neural networks is called bias; it is often referred  to as a ‘constant term’ or ‘intercept’ in classical regression analysis. It is a purely  technical term, and as such it is not relevant to the present discussions, although it is used in neural networks. Bias is analysed in the context of discrimination (as a legal and normative concept) in this report. Discrimination is mainly linked to prejudices picked up or enshrined in data, but may also be the result of statistical bias.Definitions  of bias: Not to get lost in translation * FRA (2018), Handbook  on European nondiscrimination law, Luxembourg,  Publications Office, Chapter 2. 
24 First, not all forms of bias relate to protected  characteristics. For example, an algorithmic  model that differentiates between people  based on whether or not they have a pet does  not directly target a protected characteristic,  and having a pet or not is unlikely to act as a  proxy for a protected characteristic. Second,  even if an algorithm contains bias related to  a protected characteristic, the result may still  not be discriminatory if the decision taken  based on the algorithmic system does not lead  to less favourable treatment, or is justifiable  for the purpose it is employed. For example,  an algorithm that chooses which song from a  predetermined playlist you hear next may have  a gender bias, but it is questionable whether  presenting songs in a different order constitutes  less favourable treatment. Algorithms may also  contain bias related to protected characteristics,  which are justifiable in relation to genuine  occupational requirements, such as age limits  for certain jobs requiring physical fitness.24  Therefore, to determine the legal implications, an algorithm must always be assessed within  the particular context and purpose of its use. Bias in algorithms may lead to direct  discrimination when reliance on a protected  characteristic leads to less favourable treatment.  This will normally occur only where coded  parameters and/or training data and input data  include features that directly indicate a protected  characteristic (e.g. where a predictive policing  algorithm includes information on the ethnicity  of residents in a particular neighbourhood or  where a content moderation algorithm contains  information about the ethnic origin of the author  of a particular post). Such information can be easily spotted when it is directly  included, and this allows for the assessment of differential treatment based  on those characteristics. More often than not, however, algorithmic bias leads to indirect discrimination  because of the inclusion of proxies. A proxy is a seemingly neutral piece of  information that is nevertheless strongly related to a protected characteristic.  For example, shoe size as a proxy for gender or names as a proxy for ethnicity.  Discrimination resulting from the use of proxies is more difficult to prevent, as there is a potentially limitless number of proxies, and their correlation to  a protected characteristic will be evident to various extents. For example,  the selection of certain neighbourhoods for enhanced policing activities  may correspond to neighbourhoods that are composed mainly of certain  minorities. While geographical area may not be a reason for discrimination, the composition of the population of the neighbourhoods may be. Where someone brings a claim of discrimination (e.g. a user of a social  network whose posts tend to be removed claims discrimination based on  ethnicity), the burden of proof usually rests upon that person to establish a presumption of discrimination. 25 Statistical evidence, for example based on  discrimination testing, can be useful for this purpose. There is no generally  accepted rule as to what kind of statistical bias triggers the presumption Discrimination can take different  forms:  ―direct discrimination takes place when a person receives less favourable treatment  than another in a comparable  situation, based on a protected ground;  ―indirect discrimination takes place when an apparently neutral provision, criterion or  practice puts people with a  particular protected characteristic at a disadvantage compared with others;  ―when several grounds of discrimination are involved, multiple discrimination (where the grounds operate separately)  or intersectional discrimination  (where the grounds interact and are inseparable) can occur;  ―discrimination by association is where a person is treated less favourably based on another  person’s protected characteristic,  but is not themselves the person with the protected characteristic. For more information, see FRA (2018), Handbook on European non-discrimination law, Luxembourg,  Publications Office.Forms of  discrimination
25 of discrimination. While some scholars have proposed certain formalised  schemes to assess the disadvantages across demographic groups (called  conditional demographic disparity) as a starting point to assess potential  discrimination, it is also well established that the most appropriate fairness  metrics arguably always depend on the specific context.26 While it is clear  that a rule that puts 85 % or 90 % of users with a particular ethnicity at a  disadvantage will trigger a presumption of discrimination,27 the threshold  of what counts as sufficiently significant discrimination cannot be defined  in the abstract but must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into  account a number of factors.28 When a presumption of discrimination has been established, the burden shifts  to the alleged ‘defendant’, who must provide evidence that the less favourable  treatment was not based on a protected characteristic.29 A presumption of  discrimination can be rebutted by the defendant. To do so, they must prove  either that the victim is not in a similar situation to their ‘comparator’ or that  the difference in treatment is based on an objective factor unconnected  to the protected ground. This could be done by providing insight into the  real source code, by applying other (and at least as appropriate) fairness  metrics30 or by demonstrating how the algorithm works with the help of  post hoc explanation tools showing that the dependency on the protected  characteristic does not exist.31 Finally, some scholars suggest that algorithmic systems may discriminate  not only along the lines of existing human prejudice and discriminatory  behaviour, but also based on new grounds such as profiling identities based  on a combination of behavioural and demographic characteristics.32 As far as  these categorisations serve as proxies for existing protected characteristics,  such as gender or race, any ‘new combinations’ are already covered by  existing European non-discrimination law. If, however, algorithmic systems treat individuals less favourably because of (a collection of) characteristics  that bear no link to the existing protected characteristics, new groups of  disadvantaged individuals may emerge. As a result, some scholars argue that  the prevention of discrimination linked to legally protected grounds may no longer be sufficient. Such groups could, for example, comprise people who  play online games, dog owners or ‘sad teenagers’. 33 The fact that AI and algorithmic systems often lack transparency complicates  the detection of discrimination, as previously noted by FRA.34 For example,  proving a direct form of discrimination in a fully disclosed relatively simple machine learning algorithm or statistical model (such as logistic regression)  may be relatively straightforward. Such algorithms may directly indicate  the extent to which predictions changed based on protected characteristics  (such as gender). However, detecting and proving discrimination becomes  more difficult if the algorithm is not fully disclosed or is more complex. Still,  evidence for discrimination could then be sought by running tests on the  systems using experimental methods. If the output of algorithms differs  when only information on protected characteristics changes, there is a risk for  discrimination. As a consequence, a variety of methods need to be developed  and deployed to investigate potential bias, to address potential discrimination. Moreover, in the absence of opportunities to test algorithms using experimental  methods, other information can help indicate discrimination, such as the use  of so-called explainable AI technologies, showing which information in the  data contributes most to the predictions.
26 In its 2018 report #BigData: Discrimination in  data-supported decision making, FRA highlighted that the processing of personal data related to  protected characteristics may be needed to detect  and potentially mitigate discriminatory outcomes when using algorithms. Such data collection, however, needs to comply with data protection  law, which includes specific requirements for data  linked to protected characteristics. In general, the processing of special categories  of personal data revealing, among other things,  racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or sexual  orientation is prohibited except for the grounds of justification listed in Article 9 (2) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The two grounds  with the broadest scope of application are detailed  in points (a) (the data subject’s explicit consent) and (g) (necessity for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of EU or national law). The latter must be proportionate to the aim pursued,  respect the essence of the right to data protection  and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject. Detecting algorithmic bias or discrimination is not  a specifically mentioned justification for processing  sensitive personal data, such as data on racial origin or sexual orientation, in the GDPR. This is why it may be currently unclear to what extent such processing is lawful in view of data protection  legislation. The proposed AIA may change this, as  Article 10 (5) of the proposal explicitly mentions bias monitoring, detection and correction as a separate justification for the processing of  sensitive categories of personal data as part of  the quality standards for high-risk AI systems. If data controllers process sensitive data based on Article 9 (2) (g) GDPR in line with Article 10 (5) AIA proposal, they have to implement appropriate  safeguards for the fundamental rights and  freedoms of natural persons whose sensitive personal data are processed.

29 This chapter provides an analysis of feedback  loops, with respect to the potential for bias,  based on a computer simulation to test a  simplified version of a predictive policing  algorithm in relation to crime occurrence in  neighbourhoods. However, the aim of the  analysis is not to examine predictive policing,  but rather to analyse how feedback loops occur  and under what circumstances. A feedback loop occurs when predictions  made by a system influence the data used to  update the same system. Algorithms influence  algorithms, because their recommendations and  predictions influence the reality on the ground.  For example, an algorithm’s predictions of crime  occurrence changes the behaviour of police  officers, which in turn influences the detection  of crime. The detected crimes are then fed back  into the system. Feedback loops are common,  and many machine learning systems have such built-in feedback. Figure 1  provides a simplistic illustration of a feedback loop. FIGURE 1:  SIMPLIS TIC ILLUSTRATION OF A FEEDBACK LOOP AIReal worldinﬂuences feeds into Source:  FRA , 2022 Machine learning models include algorithms that have ‘learned’ to accomplish  a given task by being ‘trained’ on data to identify a pattern that can be used  to make predictions about new, unseen data. For example, credit-rating  models can only determine a low-risk candidate based on who has been Imagine living in a neighbourhood  with a very strong police presence. While the standard  of living and perceived safety  in the neighbourhood increase considerably, police presence in  the neighbourhood remains high  and the police regularly stop and search people on the streets. Are the reasons behind the police presence  based on correct and representative  facts, and what role – if any – does the police’s new AI-based crime prevention tool play in this? Does bias play a role?How could a  feedback loop affect your day-to-day life?2 FEEDBACK LOOPS: HOW ALGORITHMS  CAN INFLUENCE ALGORITHMS
30 given credit in the past, an offensive speech detection algorithm can only  detect offensive speech based on what has been tagged as offensive in  the past and prediction models used in human resources contexts to screen  potential applicants for a position can only update based on the actual future  performance of approved applicants and not that of those applicants who  were rejected. Some machine learning models, such as so-called batch models or online  learning models, continue to ‘learn’ after deployment. The model produces a prediction, decisions are made and the observed results are added to the  training data for the next round of training. This is a classic feedback loop  situation: predictions made by the system influence the data fed back into it for future predictions. 33 In the policing context, predictive policing systems that can help determine which neighbourhoods should be patrolled are based on available existing  crime data. Such data include observed and reported incidents. Feedback  loops, as described above, can create a so-called self-fulfilling prophecy.  For example, if the system ‘detects’ more crime in district A and decides to send more patrols there, more crimes will be recorded in district A, and the  corresponding data will be fed back into the system, reinforcing the system’s  ‘belief’ that there is more crime in district A. Feedback in a system is described as ‘runaway’ when it causes a ‘winner takes  all’ situation – it ends up recommending only one solution and overestimates  results. In predictive policing systems, this would mean that the system is  likely to send police to the same neighbourhoods, based on the data fed into  the system, regardless of the true crime rate. This would lead to overpolicing  some neighbourhoods while underpolicing others. The simulation study in this section will show, based on a simplified example,  how several parameters may influence the formation of feedback loops.  These include the following.  ―Crime reporting rates.  These include crimes reported to the police by  witnesses or victims.  ―Police distribution.  This refers to the percentage of police patrols  distributed across neighbourhoods.  ―Observability of crime. This measures how likely it is that police detect a crime in a particular neighbourhood. 
31  ―True crime distribution.  This is an assumed distribution of crime taking  place, including reported, detected and unrecorded crime. Such a number  is not known in reality but can be included in a simulation study, using a  range of different values to explore its impact on feedback loop formation. In addition, the influence of different algorithms is analysed, as are mitigation  measures to limit the influence of feedback loops. The simulation is based  on theoretical assumptions that are tested by artificially mirroring many  iterations over time. While the results of the simulation exemplify how  real-life situations may play out over time, it is not an analysis of real-world  applications, which are likely to be more complex. However, in order to make as  realistic assumptions as possible, some parameters are taken from real-world  data, such as data on the general population’s crime experiences and rates  of reporting to the police, which are collected by crime victimisation surveys. Section 2.1 provides an overview of the fundamental rights and applicable  EU law relevant to the use case of predictive policing, the example used  throughout this chapter, while Section 2.2 provides an overview of current  actual use of predictive policing in the EU and Section 2.3 outlines known  challenges linked to the use of predictive policing. Section 2.4 presents  the results of the simulations carried out for this analysis, and Section 2.5  concludes. 2.1. EU  LAW AND BIAS IN PREDICTIVE POLICING  SYSTEMS 2.1.1. Fundamental rights affected by overpolicing and underpolicing Overpolicing is understood, for the purpose of this report, as the disproportionate  ‘over’-presence of police in a particular area in relation to the true crime  rate. Underpolicing means a disproportionate ‘under’-presence of police in  a particular area in relation to the true crime rate. Both can have adverse  fundamental rights implications.34 The debate concerning discriminatory  and other adverse effects of predictive policing on fundamental rights has  so far mostly focused on overpolicing and concerns that individuals present  in overpoliced areas might be negatively affected, namely with respect to  their fundamental rights. Overpolicing can involve concrete action being taken against particular  individuals, including police stops and searches, identity checks and intrusion  in homes. These actions can affect the right to physical integrity (Article 3 of the Charter), the right to respect for private and family life (Article 7 of  the Charter) and the right to data protection (Article 8 of the Charter). When  individuals are arrested, the right to liberty and security (Article 6 of the  Charter) is affected. Overpolicing may also have a ‘chilling effect’ on the way  individuals express their views and/or gather in publicly accessible spaces,  affecting the freedom of expression and information (Article 11 of the Charter)  and the freedom of assembly and of association (Article 12 of the Charter). While overpolicing may affect fundamental rights, including because of its  potential link to racial profiling and similar discriminatory police activities,  underpolicing can also be detrimental to fundamental rights. A lack of police  presence in a particular area may put people living there at a higher risk of  becoming victims of crime, posing a risk to a variety of fundamental rights,  ranging from the rights to life and physical integrity (Articles 2 and 3 of the  Charter) to the right to property (Article 17 of the Charter), for example. When  individuals fear becoming victims of crime, this can also negatively affect  their enjoyment of a range of fundamental rights.
32 Overpolicing may amount to discrimination  where the negative effects associated with it  (see above) lead to less favourable treatment of  individuals based on protected characteristics.  For instance, the use of predictive policing  algorithms may result in overpolicing of areas  mainly inhabited by certain ethnic minorities,  whereby the area itself becomes a proxy for  ethnic origin. The European Court of Human  Rights (ECtHR) has consistently held that the  state has a duty to investigate a potential  causal link between police officers’ alleged  racist attitudes and mistreatment suffered by  individuals at their hands.35 The same critique  should be true for biased algorithms. If the initial assumption of the police that there will be more crime in district A than  in district B is based directly on a protected  characteristic (such as the dominance of a  particular ethnic group in district A), this would  amount to direct discrimination.36 If, however,  a place-based predictive policing model that  pursues a seemingly objective goal (e.g.  the prevention of crime) through seemingly  objective means (e.g. a higher incidence rate  of crime in a certain neighbourhood) ends up  targeting groups associated with a protected  characteristic more than others, this is indirect  discrimination. This type of discrimination is more difficult to prove and is subject to  justification if there is a legitimate aim and the measure is proportionate. 37 As police resources are limited, overpolicing  certain areas compared with others regardless  of the true crime rate ultimately also affects the  rights of individuals outside those overpoliced  areas. Underpolicing, by failing to intervene  when – for example – women report intimate  partner violence, can also have significant  fundamental rights consequences. The ECtHR  has emphasised that states failing to adequately  respond to certain forms of violence were  considered in breach of Convention rights.38 For  example, the ECtHR found Turkey in breach of  non-discrimination under Article 14 European  Convention on Human Rights, on the basis of  gender, in conjunction with the right to life and  prohibition of ill-treatment under Articles 2 and 3. In that case, the police had failed to  adequately address domestic violence in a  case of clear threats by a known perpetrator  of domestic violence.39 There is extensive ECtHR  jurisprudence clarifying that the state is obliged  to carry out effective investigations when crimes  occur.40Around 14 % of the general  population experienced a police stop during the past year and 27 %  experienced one in the past five  years, according to FRA’s 2019 Fundamental Rights Survey, which is based on around 35,000 interviews  across the EU, North Macedonia  and the United Kingdom. Police stops more often concern men, young people, people from ethnic minorities, especially Muslims, and  people who do not self-identify as  heterosexual. For example, out of people who consider themselves to be part of an ethnic minority,  22 % in the EU-27 were stopped by  the police in the 12 months before the survey, as opposed to 13 %  of people who do not consider  themselves to be part of an ethnic minority. Immigrants’ and ethnic minorities’  trust in the police depends on how  they experience being stopped by  the police and whether or not they perceive the stops as ethnic profiling. The perception of being subjected to ethnic profiling when stopped by  the police in the previous five years  is most common among immigrants and descendants of immigrants from South Asia in Greece (89 %) and  Roma in the Netherlands (86 %)  and Portugal (84 %), according to FRA’s Second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey (2016) and the Roma and Travellers  Survey (2019). In comparison, other  minorities surveyed had a lower perception of having experienced a discriminatory police stop. For example, the Russian minority in  the Baltic states never felt that they  were stopped by the police because of their ethnic background. In Poland and Slovenia, 9 % and 5 %, respectively, of recent immigrants  from countries outside the EU felt  they were stopped because of their ethnic origin.

33 In addition, the interaction of the police with the public in overpoliced or  underpoliced areas can also be different. This is again based on assumptions  or learned responses concerning these areas and the people who inhabit  them. This may be reflected in the ‘quality’ of a police encounter with the  public, for example with respect to a police stop, whereby those stopped  in areas that are ‘overpoliced’ receive less respectful treatment than those  stopped in areas that are ‘underpoliced’. This is something that has been  documented by several studies, but is – in this instance – beyond the scope of  the current ‘use case’ model with respect to available data. See, for example,  results of FRA surveys showing that certain groups, such as people with  Roma and North African backgrounds, more often experience disrespectful  behaviour by police.41 2.1.2. EU secondary law in relation to predictive policing The Law Enforcement Directive42 deals with the processing of personal data  for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution  of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. Article 11 Law  Enforcement Directive addressed automated individual decision-making, which  is prohibited unless authorised by an EU or Member State law that provides appropriate safeguards: “at least the right to obtain human intervention”. 43  Moreover, authorities that wish to use predictive policing algorithms  should carry out a data protection impact assessment.44 However, the Law  Enforcement Directive may not apply to place-based predictive policing (in  contrast with person-based predictive policing), as predictions in the context  of place-based predictive policing usually do not include personal data, but rather use aggregated statistics. In addition, the decision-making may not be fully automated (i.e. based “solely  on automated processing” and “without meaningful human involvement in  the decision process”) because the predictions support only decisions on  where to send police.45 While the simulations used for this analysis were fully  automated, in the real world there is usually a form of meaningful human involvement when deciding where to allocate police patrols, which is why  Article 11 Law Enforcement Directive would probably not apply to the realworld use of such algorithms. 46 The AIA proposal (see Section 1.2) contains specific requirements for feedback  loops pursuant to Article 15 (3) AIA, which addresses “AI systems that continue  
34 to learn after being placed on the market or put  into service”. The design of such systems has to  ensure that biased outputs due to feedback loops  are “duly addressed with appropriate mitigation  measures”. This provision only applies to AI  systems categorised as ‘high risk’. This applies  to law enforcement use cases in the area of  predictive policing, but currently does not apply  to place-based predictive policing systems. As  the negotiations of the proposed regulation were  ongoing at the time of writing this report, it is  not analysed any further at this stage. 2.2. PREDICTIVE POLICING IN THE  EUROPEAN UNION Various law enforcement agencies across the  EU have used or are currently using (or at  least testing) algorithmic systems – so-called  predictive policing systems – to predict when  and where crime might take place.47 Predictive policing involves the application of  analytical techniques – particularly quantitative  techniques – to identify likely targets for police  intervention and to prevent crime or solve past  crimes by making statistical predictions.48 Beyond using crime statistics, the data such systems use for training and/or as input can include geographical data (such as landmarks and important  infrastructure) and social, cultural and economic information. The algorithms In developing and using algorithmic  profiling, bias may be introduced at each step of the process. To  avoid this and subsequent potential  violations of fundamental rights, both information technology experts and officers interpreting the data  should have a clear understanding of  fundamental rights. This FRA guide explains what  profiling is, the legal framework that regulates it and why conducting  profiling lawfully is both necessary  to comply with fundamental rights and crucial for effective policing and border management. For more information, see FRA  (2018), Preventing unlawful  profiling today and in the future:  A guide, Luxembourg, Publications Office.FRA  handbook: Preventing unlawful profiling today and in the future: A guide
35 used range from logistic regression49 to more complex machine learning  methods. However, for various reasons – trade secrets, data privacy issues,  confidentiality of law enforcement activities for security purposes – very little  is generally known about the algorithms used in predictive policing, the data  used to train the models and the ensuing police actions taken as a result of  the predictions. In summary, most predictive policing models are proprietary,  making it difficult to research and understand their precise functioning. One  exception to this is PredPol,50 a tool used to predict high-risk areas of crime  based on historical crime data, including information about the type of crime,  its location and the time of occurrence.51 Alongside internationally relevant predictive policing systems  such as PredPol and HunchLab, other systems are currently being deployed in Europe. For example, one of the most widespread  systems in Austria, Germany and Switzerland is Precobs, a  German software developed by the Institut für musterbasierte Prognosetechnik.* Precobs is a system for assessing the likelihood that certain  areas will experience burglaries during a given time span.** The algorithm is based on the theory of near-repeat phenomena,  which identifies burglaries that are likely to be followed by crimes  in the vicinity.*** It uses geographical data, combined with police statistics on burglary locations, time of occurrence, items stolen and modus operandi, to deduce patterns corresponding to professional serial burglars and predict likely near-repeat  burglaries.**** Here, theory and research pre-date the use of  AI systems, notably in relation to criminological studies from the 1980s on crime ‘hotspots’.***** Two predictive policing systems were deployed in the  Netherlands in 2019: SyRI and CAS. SyRI is a system designed  to help the government identify individuals at risk of engaging  in fraud in the areas of social security, tax and labour law. While PredPol, Precobs and CAS are examples of ‘place-based predictive policing’, SyRI provides an example of a ‘person-based predictive policing’ system. SyRI received a lot of media  attention owing to a 2020 District Court of The Hague ruling  (ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2020:865) that it violates the right to privacy as contained in Article 8 European Convention on Human  Rights,****** and, as a result, was discontinued by the Dutch  government. The second system, CAS, has been deployed on a national scale in the Netherlands, making the Netherlands the first country in the world to adopt predictive policing nationwide, and is still in use. Rather than focusing on individuals, CAS is  programmed to identify future crime hotspots. Areas are divided  into squares of 125 by 125 metres, which are categorised by the potential risk of crime occurring in this area. Colour coding these squares results in so-called heat maps, which are used by the  police to investigate areas or distribute police patrols.*******Predictive  policing systems in Europe * L attacher, S.

36 2.3. SO ME CHALLENGES LINKED TO THE USE OF  PREDICTIVE POLICING The literature on predictive policing currently raises three main problems  with predictive policing systems:  ―lack of transparency and accountability52  ―biased data53  ―the potential for runaway feedback loops.54 The lack of transparency and accountability  covers two aspects. First, owing  to intellectual property law, and often also the complexity of the algorithms  used, law enforcement officers themselves may not have the information  or training required to fully comprehend what an algorithm is doing and  why. This makes it difficult to detect errors or biases in model predictions. In addition, the lack of transparency restricts the possibility for independent  research, which results in a lack of objective assessment of the mechanisms  of action and effectiveness of the predictive policing systems. The second issue is biased data . FRA previously pointed to the recurrent  concern that the reliance on historical crime data – which may be biased or  incomplete – could lead predictive policing systems to reproduce and entrench  existing discriminatory practices.55 The main objective of predictive policing is to identify areas at high risk of  crime (or individuals at high risk of committing crimes) so that police can take  action to prevent such crime. These systems are based on the premise that  past crime events contain the patterns for predicting future crime events,  and therefore require historical crime data to function. However, decades of criminological research have shown the limitations of such an approach, as  police databases are not a complete census of all criminal offences and do  not constitute a representative random sample. 56 To mitigate the limitations of official crime statistics in accurately assessing the  ‘real’ extent and nature of crime, a number of countries carry out victimisation  surveys, which randomly sample the population and ask them about their experiences of crime, ranging from property crime through to violent crime,  and more recently online fraud and related internet crime. Importantly, these  surveys ask people whether they report their experiences of crime to the police, which allows for an estimate of how much crime is ‘undercounted’ in  official crime statistics – the so-called dark figures. For example, the National  Crime Victimization Survey has been carried out in the United States since 1973, the British Crime Survey has been undertaken in the United Kingdom  since 1982 and the Swedish Crime Survey has been carried out in Sweden  since 2006. 57 FRA’s surveys adopt a classic crime victimisation survey model  when asking about experiences of crime victimisation and reporting to the  police, ranging from targeted surveys of specific groups in the population (e.g.  ethnic minorities and immigrants, Roma and Jewish respondents) or specific  subject areas (violence against women), alongside the FRA Fundamental  Rights Survey of the general population. The third challenge associated with predictive policing systems is the subject  of the present analysis: the potential for runaway feedback loops.
37 Police crime statistics consist of two kinds of records/ sources (each of which may be associated with bias and errors): crime incidents that are observed or detected by the  police themselves (referred to here as ‘detected crime’); crime incidents that are reported to the police by victims,  witnesses or third parties.* For ‘detected/observed crime’, it should be noted that not  all crimes are equally observable – for example violence  and drug-related offences committed openly in public places versus the less visible crimes of business fraud and tax evasion** – causing certain types of crime to  be overrepresented in crime statistics. Furthermore,  police practices themselves can be biased or prejudiced, meaning that what gets perceived as a crime*** or who is stopped and controlled**** (and hence more likely to be detected) largely depends on demographics. In turn, not all crime incidents that are reported to the police are  recorded, and therefore may not feature in official police  crime statistics. At the same time, victimisation surveys also provide  evidence that crime reporting varies – by type of crime and by socio-economic status of victims.***** The  combined effect for the police crime data is that crime  observability and overall detection can depend on crime type and on demographic characteristics of the perpetrator and/or the victim.Police crime  statistics * Dreißigacker, A.

38 2.4. SIM ULATING FEEDBACK LOOPS IN POLICING Two main simulations were conducted in order to demonstrate how feedback  loops may occur in predictive policing.  ―The first simulation is built on a simple machine learning classification  model. It explores which parameters influence the process of feedback  loop formation generally.  ―The second simulation employs a more complex model, offering a more  realistic setting in which feedback loops form in predictive policing systems. ‘Synthetic’ datasets were generated for the simulations, meaning that data were artificially produced and randomly created by a computer to have the  necessary statistical properties. It can be understood as the simulation of a  distribution of crime in a fictitious city. These datasets do not correspond to  real crime events. However, some parameters are based on real-world data. As mentioned above and depicted in Figure 2, the simulation included several  parameters that were investigated for their influence on the formation of  feedback loops. These include the crime reporting rates ( α), police distribution  (β), observability of crime ( V), which is the likelihood of detecting a certain  crime) and the assumed ‘true’ crime distribution (Ω). Parameters α and V take into account all recorded crimes (reported and  detected). The true crime distribution additionally includes (assumed) nonrecorded crime. Parameters α, V and Ω remain constant throughout the  simulation; β is initially determined, and is the only value that changes over  time, identifying the formation of feedback loops. These are basic assumptions of the simulation study, which is limited with  respect to the number of parameters investigated and analysed. FIGURE 2:  SCHEMA TIC DESCRIPTION OF THE SIMULATED PREDICTIVE  POLICING PROCESS Crime takes place True crime rate = /uni03A9 V α β Police records Predictive algorithm Allocate police according to predictions Crime is observed by policeCrime is reported by police Source:  FRA , 2022
39 Two simulations were conducted, which vary according to:  ―the policing strategy (i.e. the allocation of police to areas based on the  predictions), including allocation of police according to levels of crime  (effective policing ) and allocation of the majority of police to a fixed  number of most affected areas (hotspot policing);  ―the prediction algorithms used, including simple probabilistic models and  more complex machine learning models;  ―the number of areas (also referred to as neighbourhoods or cells), which  differs as only two are used in the first simulation whereas multiple areas  are used in the second simulation. Further assumptions include the following:  ―although the average number of true crime events is kept constant within  each simulation, it is assumed that only one third of the true number of  crime events are observed and recorded;  ―a police visit to a cell increases the likelihood that a crime event is  detected by a factor of five. This is only an assumption, and is used  to hold this parameter constant in order to ease interpretation of the  model’s results. In reality, the likelihood that crime is detected may vary  across neighbourhoods based on different police behaviour within these  neighbourhoods. FRA’s surveys show differences across ethnic groups’ experiences with police treatment (see Section 2.1.1 above). The simulation is necessarily limited to a smaller number of assumptions in  order to keep various factors constant and allow for testing of variations among  the parameters selected. The details of the assumptions and parameters are  outlined in Annex II of this report. Mitigation strategies were employed and tested as the final step. Mitigation  strategies were suggested based on the sources of bias identified in the  research; they were then tested in both simulation experiments. Such  mitigation strategies include behavioural changes of actors such as victims  or the police, and technical methods to remove data imbalances. This step  includes assuming that reporting rates are changing or varying on the one  hand, and that technical solutions to avoid predictions too closely follow  the training data (i.e. technical measures to avoid overfitting) on the other.  Further explanations of mitigation strategies and the results of their testing  are provided in Section 2.4.3. 2.4.1. Simulation 1: Exploring different sources of bias The first results are based on a simple probabilistic model in only two  neighbourhoods. This means the police patrols are distributed according to  the crime distribution based on ‘historical’ police data. In this simulation, the  police are always sent in proportion to the crimes observed, and no statistical  or machine learning tools are used. In this case, no runaway feedback loops  are formed when all the following conditions are satisfied.  ―The true crime distribution  (Ω) is uniform, which means that crime can  happen in every neighbourhood with the same likelihood.  ―Crime reporting rates (α) are the same for all neighbourhoods. In other words, the proportion of victims reporting crime behaviour is the same  across neighbourhoods.  ―The police act in exactly the same way when sent to different  neighbourhoods. This is true for any value of initial patrol distribution, and reproduces previously  published theoretical predictions.58 However, as soon as the true crime  distribution deviates from being uniform, runaway feedback loops are formed,  if assuming the crime reporting rates are small (around 0.1) or zero and no  mitigation measures are adopted.
40 Only when a machine learning algorithm is used may a feedback loop occur.  A simple probabilistic model and a simple machine learning model called  naive Bayes are used in this example. This is shown in Figure 3. The true  crime rate was the same in both neighbourhoods, but the initial allocation  of police was 20 % in one neighbourhood and 80 % in the other. It can  be observed that, for the probabilistic model, the distribution of patrols β  (represented by the orange and blue lines) did not change over time (the lines  remained horizontal). Despite the true distribution of Ω being uniform, the  initial historical bias was maintained throughout the simulation. In contrast,  the naive Bayes predictions with the same parameters gradually contributed  to the generation of a runaway feedback loop that assigned, after 40 weeks,  100 % of the police resources to district 2. Even in the situation in which the  true crime rate is uniform and reporting rates to the police are zero in both  neighbourhoods, the naive Bayes model forms a runaway feedback loop.  This is the first of several instances in which the introduction of a machine  learning model increases the unpredictability of the predictive policing system. Even when the true crime rate and the corresponding allocation of patrols  are both uniform (i.e. the same or constant), the naive Bayes model ends up  with a runaway feedback loop. However, where the model ends up assigning  100 % of the police patrols is entirely a matter of chance: when running the same simulation 10 times, the model assigned all patrols to district 1 on five  occasions and it assigned all patrols to district 2 on the other five occasions.  The amount of time it took for the runaway feedback loop to form also varied  greatly: it took 75 weeks in some cases and even more than 400 weeks  in one case. This means that the use of machine learning algorithms can  exacerbate the formation of a feedback loop. FIGURE 3:  RESUL TS OF SIMULATION 1: ALLOCATION OF PATROLS OVER TIME –   SIMPLE PROBABILITIES VS SIMPLE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM Probabilistic model No runaway  feedback loopRunaway  feedback loop completely f ormed at : T ~40 weeksNaive Bayes model All patrols 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.01.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0Few patrolsß 100 1 week 20 ye ars101102103 Time100 1 week 20 ye ars101102103 TimeDistrict 1 District 2District 1District 2 Source:  FRA , 2022 Thus, we see that as soon as a predictive model is included in the system,  runaway feedback loops are formed for all combinations of parameters.  Machine learning models can amplify small differences, which may be  enshrined in historical data: the simulations end up assigning all the police  patrols to the neighbourhood with the highest crime rate in the input data.  The determination of where the runaway feedback loop will assign all the  police patrols is random (i.e. by chance) if the differences in true crime  rates are small (1 % or less). Moreover, this behaviour is reproduced also by 
41 logistic regression. Importantly, such behaviour is observed if no additional  measures are taken, whereas in real-life contexts humans would intervene  to interpret, question and apply the results. These initial simulations simply  show that machine learning algorithms tend to react to random signals/ patterns and may exacerbate them. In addition, various other sets of values of the relevant parameters were  explored, and their influence individually and in several combinations was  investigated. The execution of several simulations highlights different possible  sources of bias in the system. Not surprisingly, the level of crime reporting  influences feedback loops. When  crime reporting rates are greater than zero and equal for all neighbourhoods, the  formation of runaway feedback loops is reduced. However, if a neighbourhood  with a low crime reporting rate coincides with a neighbourhood where the  true crime rate is higher, this mitigates the formation of feedback loops,  equilibrating reported and observed/detected crime. However, if the place  where victims report more crime coincides with where the true crime rates  are higher, then the mitigation of feedback loops is diminished. The opposite case becomes relevant when the difference in crime reporting  rates between neighbourhoods is large (more than doubled) and the true  crime distribution is close to uniform. In that case, the neighbourhood with  lower ‘true crime’ ends up with the largest portion of police patrols. This  phenomenon enhances the relevance of crime reporting, because, as has  been observed, feedback loops usually form around the neighbourhood  with the highest ‘true crime’. However, here it can be observed that the ‘true  crime rates’ can be distorted by excessive differences in the crime reporting  behaviour across neighbourhoods. Finally, we also consider the parameter crime observability . This indicates the  likelihood of a crime being observed if police are present in a neighbourhood.  When crime reporting is zero, crime observability may be more relevant than  the true crime rate, and the runaway feedback loop ends up sending all police  patrols to an area where there is a lower overall crime rate but where crime is  more observable. This effect can sometimes be mitigated by crime reporting  rates under certain circumstances, but it can also be reinforced by them. The  result does not change much if the initial crime distribution is varied. Three different sources of bias were analysed in the first experiment (these  are summarised below and visualised in Figure 4):  ―a first source of bias can be observed when crime is reported through  differential crime reporting rates;  ―a second source of bias may stem from machine learning models that  may overreact to random noise (i.e. by chance) in the data and amplify small differences;  ―a third source of bias is related to differential crime observability. Other sources of bias were not included in this simulation. For example, it  may be assumed that the police apply different policing methods and have a  different rapport with the inhabitants of an area depending on whether they  regard an area as having high or low levels of crime. While the simulation  cannot cover all potential sources of bias, the effect of increasing bias through  feedback loops holds true.

However, erroneous  allocation of police patrols may occur when crime reporting rates differ  significantly across neighbourhoods but the true distribution of crime is close to uniform.  ―Erroneous allocation of police patrols may also occur when crime  observability differs across neighbourhoods. Overall, based on the fictitious simulation cases, we found that crime reporting  rates ( α), crime observability ( V) and the true crime distribution ( Ω) are  relevant for the formation of feedback loops. In addition, we identify three types of sources for potential misallocation of police patrols. The first, due to runaway feedback loops, occurs when police are excessively  allocated in the neighbourhood with the highest crime rate. The second occurs when the neighbourhood with a lower crime rate has  a higher concentration of more observable crime: feedback loops form,  sending police patrols to the neighbourhood with less crime (because it is more observable). The third occurs when crime reporting rates vary greatly (20 % or more) between  neighbourhoods: the assignment of more police to neighbourhoods with less crime but more reporting clearly leads to erroneous allocation of patrols.
43 A recent study analysing victimisation datasets in Bogotá, Colombia, draws  similar conclusions about the bias introduced by differential crime reporting  rates.59 2.4.2. Simulation 2: Earthquake policing model and hotspot policing The earthquake policing model (see Annex II for a description) has a different  set-up from the first experiment. Its spatial distribution is different, as there  are more neighbourhoods, and the method for allocating police patrols is  different – it is based on hotspot policing. The simulation starts by observing how feedback loops are formed in 25  neighbourhoods when the true crime rates and the crime observability are the same across all the neighbourhoods, but the historical crime rates differ,  with five neighbourhoods having higher rates than the other neighbourhoods.  Figure 5 shows that a feedback loop is formed around the five top cells. After  365 iterations of the simulation (i.e. one year, as one iteration represents one  day), the estimated rates of the five cells with the highest historical crime  rates increase whereas those of the other cells reduce, despite the true crime  rate remaining constant and uniform. During the second year, the distribution  is maintained except for some random fluctuations in the estimated values.

These are not  necessarily whole numbers (integers), as the predictions are based on averages. Source:  FRA, 2022 Historical crime rates are also relevant if the true crime rates are, to some  extent, higher in other neighbourhoods, but this depends on the magnitude  of the difference of the rates. This result is not surprising and, in fact, also  reflects an unlikely situation. The historical crime rates are to some extent  linked to actual crime rates. However, it is still important to acknowledge that  historical data drive the algorithm’s predictions and future crime observations. In the next example, unbiased data are assumed, which means that the  historical data are equal to the true crime rates. Here, we can see that the  patterns are strongly reinforced and overestimated after one year. The process  is shown in Figure 6. The same simulation was also observed in another  simulation of 138 cells. An overestimation in the 20 cells with the highest  historical crime rates could be observed after one year (i.e. 365 iterations).

These are not  necessarily whole numbers (integers), as the predictions are based on averages. Source:  FRA, 2022 Without mitigation techniques, after 365 iterations (i.e. one year) of the  simulation in all tested conditions, feedback loops are formed. This means  that the estimated rates in the cells with the highest historical crime rates  (a fixed number, n, of ‘top cells’) have significantly increased, reducing the  estimated values for the other cells. Furthermore, even when the historical  data are unbiased, the set-up of the algorithm will form a feedback loop  concentrated on the n top cells and distort the estimation of the true crime rate. It is important to pay attention to the results of simulation 2, since the  historical rates completely dominate the final result. The large difference  in initial crime rates (the top cells have 50 % more crime than the other  cells), compared with a true crime distribution close to uniform, leads to the preservation of the initial historical crime rates, and to the overestimation  of crime in the top five cells. 2.4.3. Bias mitigation strategies The formations of feedback loops, as described above, are based on theoretical  models run repeatedly on a computer. This is a computer simulation creating  artificial data (although to some extent initially based on real data, as described  in Annex II). In reality, policing is much more complex and police consider  many more aspects before sending patrols into certain neighbourhoods.  Police work with people and are present on the streets, which is why a  purely computer-based simple simulation cannot reflect reality and all its  complexities. The above simulations exemplify some sources of bias that  may lead to overpolicing and underpolicing of certain neighbourhoods. This  may put people at a disadvantage if certain neighbourhoods are composed  of people from particularly disadvantaged groups, most notably ethnically  segregated neighbourhoods. The following aspects can mitigate feedback loop formation.  ―As one of the sources of bias is low or biased crime reporting rates,  increasing reporting rates can reduce feedback loops that may lead to  overpolicing.  ―Technical solutions to prevent values from becoming too extreme are  needed. Machine learning is known to potentially focus too much on  patterns in training data. This is called ‘overfitting’. To prevent algorithms  from predicting values that are too extreme, technical solutions called 
45 regularisation have to be employed. This means that extreme predictions  are avoided by adding a mathematical restriction to the algorithm. The  choice of the value of such restriction needs close scrutiny to prevent  feedback loops and, at the same time, allow predictions to be useful.  ―Other solutions have been suggested in the literature, such as  ‘downsampling’, which was introduced by Ensign et al.60 This is based on  assigning certain probabilities of recording to crime events to counteract  the overly strong predictions. These mitigation techniques are placed in the prediction cycle in Figure 7. While  each technique has its limitations, a combination of mitigation techniques  offers the most promising approach to mitigating bias.

ADDRES SING FEEDBACK LOOPS: CONCLUDING  POINTS The simulation experiments in this report were simple models that used only  automated decision-making based on a limited set of criteria and available  data. However, a real-life predictive policing system would be embedded in  law enforcement agencies, with humans interacting and making decisions  at all stages. A more promising approach to feedback loop mitigation would  benefit from a case-specific investigation into the entire predictive policing life  cycle, and the installation of context-relevant review and control procedures.  Taking this into account, a real-life context-specific model of potential police  bias – rather than the simulation model looked at here – would need to take  into account sources of bias with respect to different actors that have an  impact on a system. The following should be considered in such a model.  ―As reporting rates affect policing, it is the victims of and witnesses to  crime in the general population who are relevant in mitigating overpolicing  and underpolicing. Feedback loops can thus be mitigated by increasing  awareness in society and trying to improve crime reporting rates in 
46 general, particularly in neighbourhoods where reporting rates are low  and linked to vulnerable groups in society. Increasing trust in the police  is one important way of enhancing reporting rates, whereby the onus  should not only be on the public to report crime, but also on the police  to encourage crime reporting and make it accessible, through building  trust. FRA’s Fundamental Rights Survey showed that the lack of trust in  the police is one reason for people not reporting burglary, either because  of a general lack of trust (7 %) or because they expect the police would  not do anything about it (25 %). Moreover, those who experienced police  stops based on assumed ethnic profiling trust the police less.61  ―The police play an important role when it comes to different rates of detecting  crime, which – among other considerations – is related to the ‘observability’  of various crimes (such as street crime versus fraud). Fundamental rightscompliant policing should address police behaviour that is potentially  different depending on which neighbourhoods police are patrolling.  Awareness raising regarding policing behaviour that leads to differential  crime observability supports fairer policing in this respect. Police may see  prejudices confirmed through algorithms, and, more generally, may put too  much trust in predictions produced by algorithms. Such an overreliance can  hamper the necessary human review of algorithmic outputs.62 Awareness  about limitations and possible failures of predictive policing algorithms  among police officers is one crucial aspect to avoid unfair policing practices  as a result of police overreliance on algorithmic predictions.  ―AI developers can play an important role when it comes to addressing  the internal bias of machine learning algorithms. Police and developers,  working together, can critically examine the assignment of police patrols  according to the observed crime rates. The application of technical  mitigation techniques, based on simulation and testing prior to deployment  of systems, is required to avoid inefficient and potentially discriminatory  policing practices.  ―Affected communities can also be involved in talking to AI developers  and police authorities, to better understand potential bias. These results show that feedback loops can easily occur in fully automated  settings. While strategies with a single focus, such as debiasing historical  crime data, do not seem to be very effective, simple technical solutions to bias mitigation (such as regularisation methods) showed some success. The  simulations also indicate that the main danger of runaway feedback loops has  systemic causes. These are, in particular, differential crime observability and  crime reporting rates. Left unaddressed, these issues have the potential to  perpetuate bias and discrimination. A deeper investigation into these sources  of bias is needed before predictive policing systems can be safe to deploy. This chapter looked at simulations of simplified predictive policing algorithms.  However, the same kinds of machine learning models are used in other  predictive situations – employment decisions, credit rating, fraud prediction, to  name a few – and so the findings from this section can have wider implications  for the use of AI and its impact on fundamental rights in various contexts.  For example, a credit risk model can only learn about future outcomes of  credit repayment from those applicants who were granted credit and hence  were considered low risk. High-risk applicants will probably not receive a  loan, and so there is no additional information as to whether this decision was correct or not. Such models also run the risk of runaway feedback loops. Many of the lessons  learned in this simulation also apply. These include the necessity of maintaining  a ‘clean’ source of fresh data, meaning that the data are not influenced by  model predictions, as in the case of crime reporting for predictive policing, the  importance of how decisions based on model predictions are made, and the  importance of effective control and review throughout the model’s life cycle.
47 This report shows results of a simulation of predictive policing to see how predictions evolve  over many iterations. Several challenges are linked to researching feedback loops. The first challenge relates to availability of data on crimes, including information on the location,  time and type of crime. Such datasets are not readily available in EU Member States (they  are more readily available in the United Kingdom and the United States). In general, the granularity of available crime data in the public domain is limited, which also reduces the ability to research and simulate real crime events over space and time. There is limited information available on the implementation of commercially developed  algorithms that are used by law enforcement. Without such information, the potential  biases, the feedback loop formation and the mitigation strategies are difficult to study  accurately. The experiments described above show that certain techniques and methods can mitigate the development of feedback loops, while training and guidelines for police officers could potentially mitigate the effects of existing feedback loops. However, transparency is lacking because of trade secrets and the fact that these algorithms are owned by private  companies and are thus proprietary. Currently, researchers and other relevant actors cannot  test the exact functionality of proprietary algorithms and the extent of their effects, due to either a lack of information on the algorithm or a lack of available data. The simulation experiments in this use case used simple models that used only automated  decision-making. However, a real-life predictive policing system would be embedded in  a law enforcement agency, with humans interacting and making decisions at all stages.  In turn, human intervention should also be analysed in relation to how data based on predictive policing models are used and interpreted with respect to potential bias.Challenges  encountered when researching feedback loops

49 This chapter analyses the extent to which  bias occurs with respect to offensive speech  detection, focusing on terms related to ethnicity  and gender. Prediction algorithms were built  for this purpose and then tested for bias using  experimental methods. Algorithms based on  publicly available data were created to predict  the likelihood of certain text phrases being  classified as offensive. Such algorithms were  then fed with invented text phrases, such as  ‘I am Muslim’ or ‘Being female is great’ . Such  phrases were varied by using different words  that relate to potential grounds of discrimination.  The controlled changing of terms can provide  direct evidence of bias in the predictions. This analysis not only points towards the extent  of bias with respect to offensive speech detection classification in relation to  certain groups, such as Muslims, Jews and foreigners; it also shows that such  bias varies considerably across different algorithms and different languages  and is already embedded in available AI language tools. The analysis provides  insights into the complexity of bias in algorithms and discusses how such  bias may be linked to discrimination against certain groups. The results are  intended to help inform policy debates on how to address such bias in speech  detection algorithms. The results should also serve to inform developers and  users of AI as to where to look for bias, and how to investigate whether or  not their AI system may contribute to discriminatory outputs. This analysis does not assess how (well) offensive speech detection algorithms  being used in practice work, nor whether or not they should be used. Rather,  it examines how algorithms’ classification of certain phrases – as offensive or not – may lead to bias. Despite strong indications about the deficiencies  of such algorithms, it  cannot be concluded from this research whether such  algorithms are fit for purpose, as the exact usage depends on the context. However, the results are telling. Speech detection algorithms rely heavily on  certain words, and algorithms cannot be used without assessment of bias in view of their basic premises, actual development and usage. This chapter starts with a discussion of fundamental rights affected by the use  of biased speech detection algorithms, followed by a discussion around the actual usage and challenges of using such algorithms in content moderation  efforts. The chapter then outlines the methodology of the analysis, before  presenting the results.Is the sentence ‘I am Muslim’  offensive? Is it more offensive than ‘I am Buddhist’? Objectively, it is  not. So, why do modern algorithms  sometimes assess such text as offensive, and why ‘I am Muslim’ and not ‘I am Buddhist’? Such results are a classic example of bias in algorithms: the use of one  specific term triggers much higher  predictions of offensive content.Biased  algorithms3 ETHNIC AND GENDER BIAS IN  OFFENSIVE SPEECH DETECTION
50 3.1. FUND AMENTAL RIGHTS AFFECTED BY BIASED  SPEECH DETECTION Online hatred has become an everyday reality for many population groups  across the EU, whether it is expressed in the form of hate speech, harassment  or incitement to violence or hatred. Many professionals working with victims  of hate crime indicate that hate speech on the internet is a growing concern.63  In FRA’s 2018 survey on perceptions of antisemitism , the highest single  incidence rate of reported antisemitic harassment was related to cyberharassment.64 Furthermore, FRA’s 2012 survey on violence against women  showed that cyber-harassment against women is widespread in the EU, with  1 in 20 women in the EU reporting having experienced cyber-harassment.65 Online hatred is pervasive and challenging to moderate owing to the scale  and complexity of online communication, which has increased considerably  in recent years. Companies running online platforms are striving to moderate  the content shared on their services. In the context of content moderation, for example based on offensive speech recognition, both over-blocking and  under-blocking of content can interfere with a range of fundamental rights. So-called under-blocking of online content means that online platforms fail or  refuse to take action against offensive content, in particular offensive content  that is also illegal. Online hatred may interfere with different rights depending  on the particular content, such as the right to respect for private and family  life (Article 7 of the Charter), the right to life (Article 2 of the Charter), the  right to physical and mental integrity (Article 3 of the Charter), the right to  freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 10 of the Charter), the right to non-discrimination (Article 21 of the Charter) and the rights of the  child (Article 24 of the Charter). Studies have shown that online hatred can  lead to depression and suicide. 66 Exposure to or concern about online hatred  may also lead people to engage less frequently or express themselves less  freely, thereby having a negative impact on the freedom of expression and  information (Article 11 of the Charter). The emergence of anti-hate-speech legislation and the roll-out of automated  content moderation systems has more recently drawn policymakers’ attention  to the other side of the coin: over-blocking.67 This means the unjustified  blocking of content or the suspension or termination of user accounts.68  The fundamental right primarily put at risk by over-blocking is the right  to freedom of expression and information (Article 11 of the Charter). For  example, key provisions of the French Avia Law, which aims to combat  online hate speech, were struck down by the French Constitutional Council because they were not deemed necessary and proportionate in relation to  the freedom of expression. 69 Other fundamental rights can also be affected by over-blocking content,  depending on the particular context. These include the right to freedom  of thought, conscience and religion (Article 10 of the Charter), the right to  freedom of assembly and association (Article 12 of the Charter) and the  freedom to conduct a business (Article 16 of the Charter). It can also involve  the right to non-discrimination (Article 21 of the Charter) in the case of biased  takedown of similar content based on protected characteristics. The use of  algorithms can amplify these fundamental rights risks. It may also have an  impact on the right to an effective remedy (Article 47 of the Charter), as it  can be difficult to explain how algorithms are used and make decisions.70 With respect to ensuring fundamental rights compliance in relation to offensive  online speech detection, legitimate concerns about over-blocking or under-blocking content underline the primary need to achieve a proportionate and 
51 accurate response in practice in democratic societies. This point is addressed  further in Section 3.2. Information society services, such as those provided by online platforms, are  essential services available to the public and open to any person prepared to  subscribe to the terms and conditions needed to open an account. Access to  such services falls within the scope of both the Racial Equality Directive71 and  the Gender Goods and Services Directive,72 meaning any direct or indirect  discrimination on grounds of ethnicity or gender – which is the focus of the  offensive speech detection model in this chapter – is prohibited. ‘Access’ is to be understood broadly, for example covering the deletion of  posts and, especially, suspension or even termination of accounts, as this  directly affects access to the service. However, it must be taken into account  that the Gender Goods and Services Directive does not apply to media and  advertising.73 Member States can still choose to address these areas in national  law, going beyond the directive’s minimum requirements. Furthermore, certain limitations in terms of the grounds of discrimination are  covered by these directives. At present, neither the Racial Equality Directive  nor the Gender Goods and Services Directive directly addresses discrimination  based on sexual orientation, gender identity or religion. A prohibition of  discrimination based on sexual orientation and religion currently exists  in the employment context74 and would be subject to the proposed equal  treatment directive, which has not been enacted yet. Beyond that, gender  identity is mentioned only in Recital 9 of the Victims’ Rights Directive75 in  the context of criminal law.76 According to the Court of Justice of the European Union, gender identity is only partly covered by the principle of equal treatment between men and  women.77 Legal protection against discrimination based on religion is currently  also limited under EU law.78 Nevertheless, one may argue that many comments  referring to people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and  intersex (LGBTI), Jewish or Muslim fall under either the Racial Equality Directive  or the Gender Goods and Services Directive, because discrimination based  on sexual orientation, gender identity or religion predominantly affects a  specific race or gender. 
52 Decisions made by algorithms based on the processing of personal data may  qualify as automated individual decision-making. Article 22 GDPR generally  prohibits automated decisions that have legal effects on data subjects or  similarly significantly affect them, with exceptions.79 An automated individual  decision within the meaning of the GDPR means it is made with the exclusion  of any meaningful human involvement.80 However, fully automated decisions  are permissible if they are (a) necessary for the conclusion or performance of a  contract; (b) based on EU or national law that lays down suitable measures to  safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or (c)  based on the explicit consent of the data subject. If an automated decision is  based on (a) or (c), the controller must provide appropriate safeguards in order  to protect the privacy of the data subject. These safeguards include the right A contractual relationship exists between recipients and providers of online platforms.  These contracts contain the conditions on the basis of which the provider of the online platform is entitled to remove or limit access to the user’s content or to suspend a user  from the platform. Whether or not one of the non-discrimination directives applies,  contractual terms and practices that are inconsistent with the ‘spirit’ of fundamental rights under primary law may be considered unfair under national consumer law implementing the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (UCTD)* or under other general  clauses under national law, such as on public policy. The UCTD addresses unfair terms in consumer contracts that were not individually  negotiated (Article 1 (1) UCTD), including such contracts with online platforms (Article 3 (2) UCTD). The UCTD includes an annex with proposed blacklisted contract terms that are to be considered unfair, and a general clause covering any sort of  contract terms. National courts need to consider any inconsistency with fundamental  rights, in line with the doctrine of indirect third-party effects, particularly when applying the general clause (Article 3 (1) UCTD). Such considerations may lead to particular contract terms not being binding (Article 6 (1) UCTD). The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) addressed unfair practices  related to the terms and conditions of an online platform in 2021.** The court emphasised that providers operating online platforms can set objectively verifiable community standards that go beyond the legal requirements and sanction violations by removing individual posts or even blocking access to the network. However, they  must include a provision in their terms and conditions to inform the user immediately  following the removal of their post and in advance of any intended blocking, and to give the user the opportunity to make a counterstatement, followed by a renewed decision. In the absence of such a provision, the terms of use are invalid pursuant  to Section 307 (1) German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) (i.e. the provision  implementing Article 5 UCTD). The DSA will require all providers of intermediary services, including online platforms,  to include information on restrictions they impose in their terms and conditions. This must “include information on any policies, procedures, measures and tools used for the purpose of content moderation, including algorithmic decision-making, and human review as well as rules of procedure of their internal complaint handling system”  (Article 14 (1) DSA). Online platforms also have an obligation to include information  in their terms and conditions on “the main parameters used in their recommender systems, as well as any options for the recipients of the service to modify or influence those main parameters” (Article 27 (1) DSA). At least one option for each recommender  system shall not be based on profiling at very large online platforms (Article 38 DSA).  When applying and enforcing restrictions, providers of intermediary services must have due regard for fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter, “such as the freedom of expression, freedom and pluralism of the media, and other fundamental rights and  freedoms” (Article 14 (4) DSA).Fundamental  rights in relation to contractual terms and conditions * Council Directive 93/13/ EEC of 5 April 1993  on unfair terms in consumer contracts (Unfair Contract Terms Directive). ** Bundesgerichtshof,  III ZR 179/20 and  III ZR 192/20, 29 July  2021, paras 107–108.
53 of data subjects to obtain human intervention,  to express their point of view and to contest  the decision. For particularly sensitive personal data within  the meaning of Article 9 GDPR, an even stricter  prohibition of automated decisions applies.  The exceptions in this context are the explicit  consent of the data subject or processing based  on substantial public interest.81 To what extent  Article 22, in conjunction with Articles 13–15  GDPR, also includes a right to receive an  explanation, or whether it only includes a limited  information right, is subject to debate.82 3.2. USING ARTIFICIAL  INTELLIGENCE FOR OFFENSIVE  SPEECH DETECTION When testifying before the US Congress in  April 2018, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s Chief  Executive Officer, stated that AI is not yet ready  to be used for hate speech detection, and all  hate speech has to be reported to Facebook by  its users. Zuckerberg indicated that it is likely  that AI will be ready to support hate speech  detection in about 5–10 years.83 Facebook’s use of AI for detecting hate speech  has increased considerably since then. While  Facebook itself detected only 38 % of hate The proposed AIA requires providers  of high-risk AI systems to subject training, validation and testing data  to appropriate data governance  and management practices and to ensure that they are relevant, representative, free of errors and  complete (Article 10 (2) and (3) AIA).  In the context of content moderation algorithms, this can help to combat bias that may result in discriminatory practices. A legal ground is also added to process special categories  of personal data (‘sensitive  data’) to the extent that this is strictly necessary to ensure bias monitoring, detection and correction  (Article 10 (5) AIA). Furthermore, the AIA will also  require that “AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way, including with appropriate  human–machine interface tools, that  they can be effectively overseen by natural persons”, with the aim of “preventing or minimising the risks to health, safety or fundamental  rights” (Article 14 (1) and (2) AIA).Requirements  for data quality in the artificial intelligence act 
54 speech posted on the platform in the first quarter of 2018, this share increased  to 96 % in the first quarter of 2022. This percentage, the so-called pro-active  rate, is likely to have been driven by AI tools that help flag content, after which  humans decide what action to take, such as post deletion. The remaining  detected hate speech is from reports made to Facebook by users of its  services. The rate in the first quarter of 2022 concerns over 15 million pieces  of content that were ‘actioned’ in relation to hate speech. ‘Actioned’ refers  to any action taken by Facebook, including the potential deletion of posts.84 In addition, Google has been working on speech detection algorithms for  content moderation, and in 2017 open-sourced its machine-learning-based  model Perspective. It is available through an application programming  interface, and can be used to filter ‘toxic’ speech, for example in comments.  It reportedly helped the New York Times to increase the number of articles  on its website that allow users to post comments, as content moderation was  made more efficient through the filtering tool to support content moderation  efforts.85 At the same time, developers of the tool have issued warnings  about its limitations, stating that the tool makes errors and is unable to detect  patterns of toxicity it has not seen before.86 AI is not yet capable of being used for automated content moderation of  hate speech, particularly in relation to illegal hate speech. Many academics have warned of the limitations of using AI and algorithms for online content  moderation, and have dispelled narratives that AI could easily solve hate  speech issues.87 For example, algorithms cannot take context into account  in the way that humans can, such as by considering the sender and recipient  of a message (this information is not available to algorithms not only for  privacy reasons). Furthermore, there is a lack of representative and highquality datasets to develop algorithms, and taking into account differences in speech patterns and changing patterns of speech remains difficult. 88 The use of algorithms may further increase the opacity of content moderation  and further increase challenges linked to fairness and justice.89 Without proper  safeguards, such tools can lead to censorship and biased enforcement of laws  and platforms’ terms and conditions.90 A potential increase in discrimination is  just one of the challenges when using algorithms to support speech detection  for content moderation purposes. If a certain message is hateful, this can most readily be judged by the person  it is addressed to. And the way it is judged may differ between people. Hence,  there is no universal assessment of offensiveness on certain pieces of text.  People often disagree on the level of offensiveness of certain phrases. There  are significant differences in assessing content as offensive based on the  demographics of those assessing the content.91 For example, what a man  may not consider offensive may very well be perceived as offensive by a woman, or the other way round. This challenges the quality and usefulness  of data with fixed labels of offensiveness. Therefore, a final assessment of the hatefulness of online content should  be made by humans. However, the practicality of this, given the volume of  online data content, is seemingly insurmountable. The sheer volume of online  content that large platforms have to deal with necessitates the support of  their content moderation activities by algorithms. For example, in the second half of 2021, Twitter deleted over 5 million pieces  of content, which included about 1.3 million pieces of content because of  hateful conduct and another 1.3 million for abuse and harassment.92 As  a consequence, it is clear that algorithms can be a useful tool to identify  potentially offensive online content, but – at this stage of development – the 
55 automatic algorithm-based removal of suspected hate speech is problematic  at several levels (as explained above). This is different from other areas, for  example spam filters, which work relatively well.93 Note that email spam  filters cannot work without automated algorithmic decisions. 100 % of all  spam that Facebook deals with was identified pro-actively. However, patterns  in offensive, toxic or otherwise hateful speech are more complex, making  them more difficult to detect. Beyond content moderation and offensive speech detection, algorithms based  on so-called language models are widely used in many other domains. These  include automated translation, speech recognition, question responses and  sentiment analysis. This makes the societal risk of harm – when the algorithms  used are inadequate for their intended purpose – a real and serious threat with respect to fundamental rights compliance. 94 The following section highlights one of these fundamental rights challenges.  Based on algorithms developed for the purpose of this report’s applied  research, the following analysis will show how bias against certain groups is embedded in an offensive speech detection algorithm with respect to its  categorisation. 3.3. HO W SPEECH DETECTION ALGORITHMS WERE  TESTED FOR BIAS To further explore the abovementioned challenges and potential biases  of speech detection algorithms, fully fledged offensive speech detection  algorithms were developed and tested for bias against selected groups with  respect to categorisation of content. 3.3.1. Machine learning models Algorithms for this research were developed in three languages – English,  German and Italian – using publicly available datasets that contained text  labelled as offensive or not offensive. For each of the languages, three  different types of algorithms were developed, resulting in three models per  language (i.e. nine different tests).  ―Model 1 is relatively simple. It is trained on the training dataset with a  standard methodology simply based on the words that occur, without  considering the order of words (i.e. a ‘bag-of-words’ approach with  logistic regression).  ―Model 2 is more advanced. It uses tools that work with known semantic  relationships between existing words (i.e. ‘word embeddings’ with neural  networks).  ―Model 3 is even more advanced. It varies the relationship between words  depending on neighbouring words and sentence predictions. A ‘language  model’ is an available fully trained machine learning model that can be adapted for specific purposes in combination with new training data. See Annex I for descriptions of terms. This means that model 2 and especially model 3 include existing generalpurpose AI for language prediction tasks. This AI was further developed using  the training datasets used for this research. 3.3.2.  Data used for training and testing The three models were developed using publicly available labelled training datasets in English, 95 German96 and Italian.97  ―The English-language dataset includes over 90,000 posts collected from Twitter in 2018 by a group of researchers. The researchers subsequently 
56 used crowdsourcing (i.e. collecting input from various people on the  internet) to annotate the posts as offensive or not offensive.  ―Two datasets were used for the German language, both collected from  Twitter in 2018 and 2019 and manually annotated by the researchers as  offensive or not offensive. They contain about 15,000 and 27,000 posts,  respectively.  ―The Italian-language dataset was collected by Amnesty International Italy  in relation to the treatment of women and LGBT people between 2018  and 2020. It contains about 108,000 posts from Facebook and Twitter and  was annotated by volunteers from Amnesty International Italy. These datasets come from different sources and were developed and  annotated for different purposes, which also influences the biases against  groups (and the ability to be used in other settings). Following common  machine learning practice to test the predictions, data were split into three  sets – a training dataset, a validation dataset and a test dataset – all stemming  from the above training datasets. Further details about the datasets can be found in Annex III. For the bias analysis, an additional dataset was created. This dataset is  referred to as the ‘bias test dataset’ and is based on invented text phrases.  The sentence templates and words are based on and further developed  from existing bias test sources.98 The dataset includes neutral and positive  sentences such as ‘I am […]’ and ‘I love all […]’, and offensive sentences such  as ‘I hate all […]’. The placeholder […] was populated with different ‘identity  terms’, such as ‘Muslim’ and ‘Buddhist’. The German and Italian sentences  also used gendered nouns; for example, the feminine and masculine versions  of ‘Muslim’ were used. Nine different sentence templates were used, which  were varied by using different verbs (e.g. ‘hate’ or ‘love’) and adjectives (e.g.  ‘great’, ‘strong’, ‘disgusting’ or ‘dumb’). Overall, this led to a dataset of over 7,300 sentences in the English language,  in which about half of the sentences were rated by the research team as  offensive and the other half as non-offensive. The German- and Italianlanguage bias test dataset was twice as large as the English one, because the terms were gendered for masculine and feminine versions. Each of the  example sentences in each language was ‘fed’ into each of three models to  predict their offensiveness, based on the algorithm’s rules for categorisation  developed based on the training data. This led to over 110,000 predictions of  sentences as being either offensive or not. These predictions were investigated  for bias by analysing differences in the predictions for the same template  sentences using different identity terms. Examples of the sentences and  more details are provided in Annex III. 3.3.3. What is offensive speech and who is the judge? The text predictions are based on data considered offensive on the basis  of judgements made mainly by researchers. This comes with some level  of uncertainty as people may disagree whether certain text is offensive or  not. Such differences are, in fact, another source of bias in offensive speech  detection algorithms. This is one challenge that questions the quality and  usefulness of data with fixed labels of offensiveness, as such a perception  may vary. Research suggests that such challenges can be overcome by having  several people involved in labelling, which then creates another practical  challenge in terms of human resources and the costs of developing training  data.99 Usually, the target of a message or the people addressed in a message  is looked at to help judge the level of offensiveness. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  published guidance on a threshold test when considering limitation of freedom  of expression when assessing incitement to hatred, including various aspects 
57 such as the position of the speaker, the social and political context, and  intent.100 However, offensiveness strongly depends on the context of speech  (e.g. the sender of a message), yet such an assessment is usually not included  in offensive speech detection algorithms. This analysis is also missing such  contextual data; it only assesses text based on combinations of words. While  this points to a limited ability of the models to actually predict offensiveness  based on text alone, the present analysis is not making a point about ‘correct’  assessments. It rather shows if there are systematic differences in algorithms  with respect to certain terms, when everything else is held constant. 3.3.4. How bias was assessed Unwanted bias in the offensive speech detection models is tested by looking  at both the false positive rate (FPR) and the false negative rate (FNR). Reflecting the fact that companies themselves, using algorithms, flag the  overwhelming majority of content that is deemed to be offensive or hate  speech (and this proportion is increasing), the research team replicated this  process with respect to the algorithm’s categorisation. This categorisation  was then rated as correct or not according to ‘human’ assessment by the  research team. The FPR is defined as the percentage of comments rated as non-offensive  by the research team but classified as offensive by the model. The FNR is  the percentage of comments rated as offensive by the research team but  classified as non-offensive by the model. The analysis looks into the equality  of FPRs and FNRs across different groups of interest, applying the so-called equalised odds metric. 101 Both FPRs and FNRs are relevant as false positives  can lead to unwarranted censorship, while false negatives can lead to a failure  to detect offensive speech and to targets of abuse continuing to be subjected  to offensive comments. In reality, choices can be made in the design of the algorithm to prefer a higher FPR and a lower FNR, or the other way round,  depending on the acceptability of error on either side. Bias is defined as a model performing better for some protected characteristics  than others. Based on the work of Dixon  et al.,102 bias against certain target  groups was analysed. The analysis looks into the question of whether the algorithms more often incorrectly label text including references to certain  groups. Most offensive speech detection models are proprietary, and are thus not  available for bias testing. Therefore, offensive speech detection models  had to be built from scratch to conduct the experiments for this report. This  required the use of sufficiently large, labelled datasets, and the availability of  such datasets determined the choice of languages that could be investigated. The performance of the models in terms of accurate predictions based on  the different datasets is reported in Annex III. 3.4. RESUL TS OF ETHNIC AND GENDER BIAS IN  OFFENSIVE SPEECH DETECTION The results provided in this section show which terms, linked to selected  protected characteristics of people, contribute to classifying text as offensive  and where this may also lead to a higher likelihood of potential errors for  certain terms. All the terms were used on the same invented text phrases,  thereby ensuring that the differences that arose reflect the bias linked to  these terms alone.
58 The results of biases described in this section need to be understood in the  light of the methodology applied, as described in the previous section. This  also means that patterns found in the analysis are not necessarily transferable  to other algorithms developed for offensive speech detection with other  methodologies and in other contexts. This is most apparent because the  results of this analysis also differ across the different models developed.  However, the results still indicate certain patterns that are relevant and that are also likely to occur in other models and applications. Furthermore, the  results of biases do not necessarily lead to discrimination. Certain errors  resulting from biased predictions may not necessarily lead to less favourable  treatment. They may be countered by human review of speech detection  predictions or otherwise mitigated. 3.4.1.   W ords that make a difference: Bias against selected groups in  average predictions There are considerable differences with respect to the predictions of the  offensiveness of speech for different ethnic groups and nationalities in the test dataset. Those differences also lead to varying predictions of the same  sentences as offensive and non-offensive, based on a certain threshold. As described above, the FPR indicates the percentage of comments rated as  inoffensive by the research team but classified as offensive by the model.  The model decisions are based on a certain threshold. For example, if it  predicts an above 50 % likelihood of text being offensive, then that text is  classified as offensive. This means that non-offensive comments may be  flagged to reviewers as offensive or even automatically deleted. In this way,  the model ‘overreacts’. The differences across the identity terms used as part of the experiment,  when all other text is held constant, provide clear evidence of overreactions  when certain terms are used. A higher FPR usually comes with a lower FNR,  which is the percentage of offensive comments that are classified as nonoffensive. The FNR indicates the percentage of offensive comments that are  missed. Hence, the FPR indicates the potential for unwarranted censorship,  while the FNR indicates the share of comments rated by humans as offensive  that are missed by the algorithm. Figure 8 shows the average FPR and FNR for groups of identity terms across  all invented text/phrases used to test the models for the English-language  dataset and models. The upper panel shows the FPR. It shows that terms  linked to Muslims most often lead to predictions of offensive speech for  sentences that were rated as non-offensive by the research team. On average,  60 % of comments categorised as non-offensive by the research team were  comments that were predicted as offensive by the model. Similarly, comments  considered non-offensive by the research team, including terms linked to the  identities ‘gay’ and ‘Jew’, were often misclassified by the model, constituting  on average 51 % and 38 % of non-offensive comments, respectively. The upper panel of Figure 8 shows that the ‘overreaction’ to those terms  happens in all three models, which indicates that this comes partly from the  training data. These terms are strongly represented in comments considered  offensive in the training data, which makes the models consider those terms  alone as strong indications of text being offensive. This bias is strongest in  model 1, which is based on only the training data. This is different in models 2  and 3, which are based on pre-trained algorithms, potentially including  additional or different bias. Hence, the bias in those models is mitigated to  some extent through the use of external information. However, importantly,  the FPR for the term ‘Jew’ actually increases with the use of word embeddings 
59 (model 2), meaning that some bias against the term ‘Jew’ is already enshrined  in such resources. While model 1 also ‘overreacts’ for terms linked to ‘refugees’, ‘Nigerians’,  ‘white person’ and ‘black person’ , other models do not show higher FPRs  for those terms. For the remaining groups, all models show very low error  rates on non-offensive comments. This is due to the models predicting too  many comments as non-offensive when they are rated as offensive by the  research team (i.e. comments are usually predicted as non-offensive) for  these other groups of terms. Most of the terms used in offensive comments  miss out about half of the comments by not predicting them as offensive, as  shown in the lower panel of Figure 8. This is rather a result of the weakness  of the models to identify those comments (which are difficult to detect as  invented phrases). The bias linked to the main terms – ‘Muslim’, ‘gay’ and ‘Jew’ – in relation  to overreaction to non-offensive comments is turned around for offensive  comments. The rates of misclassifying offensive speech, including these  terms, are much lower. However, the models still typically miss about 11-20 %  of comments considered offensive by the research team.

60 Figure 9 shows the results for the German-language models. The share of  comments considered non-offensive by the research team but classified as  offensive by the model is on average higher than for the English-language  models. The term ‘refugee’ shows the most extreme results, with the highest  FPR on average. However, model 3 tends to classify virtually all comments  including the term ‘refugee’ as offensive. In contrast, model 2 does almost  the opposite by classifying about one in five non-offensive comments as  offensive and every second offensive comment as non-offensive. Other terms  with higher FPRs are ‘Muslim’, ‘foreigner’ and ‘Roma’ (all at least classifying one in three non-offensive comments wrongly as offensive). On the other  side, the terms ‘Buddhist’, ‘queer’ and ‘Eritrean’ do not lead to predictions  of offensive comments, and hence offensive speech using these terms is  more often missed.

61 Figure 10 shows the error rates for the Italian-language models. Here, several  terms trigger a high FPR, particularly those linked to Muslims, Africans,  Jews, foreigners, Roma and Nigerians. An average of 66–85 % of comments  rated as non-offensive by the research team are predicted to be offensive  by the model. This is considerably higher than the FPR of terms such as  ‘European’, ‘queer’, ‘Buddhist’ or ‘German’. Here, it is model 1 (the one without  external information from other models) in particular that misses offensive  comments for certain terms. This again shows that external, pre-trained  models do already include information on offensiveness of certain terms.  Such information can either lead to bias or reduce it.

62 Generally, model 1 results can be seen as mostly reflecting the bias in the  training data. This means that the term ‘Muslim’ is disproportionately often  included in posts rated as offensive with respect to the original training data.  This bias may also be a result of the way the training data were collected, potentially specifically looking for hate speech against Muslims. As a result,  and in the absence of contextual data, the term becomes a strong indicator  of offensive speech. This finding reiterates the importance of transparently describing training datasets when using algorithms for certain tasks. As can be seen from the distribution of colours in the figures, these biases  changed for models 2 and 3. This implies that other elements besides the  training data influenced the model outputs. For model 2, this bias came mainly  from the word embeddings. For model 3, it came mainly from the language  model. A few identity groups can be picked out as very often subject to high  FPRs across models and languages. These include Jews, Muslims, various  African nationalities, and immigrants or refugees. In addition, terms linked  to sexual orientation were more often subject to false positives. The false  negative results are even more varied. High FNRs are often linked to identities  that are not perceived as disadvantaged or marginalised, such as ‘European’,  ‘Buddhist’, ‘German’ or ‘Italian’. In addition, the term ‘Eritrean’ has a high  FNR, showing that hatred is somewhat underestimated in the test dataset. Within each language, the variations in FPRs and FNRs for the various identity  terms indicate that the bias in the models is not due only to the bias in  the training data, but is also derived from the features of the model itself.  Otherwise, all models would have very similar levels of bias reflected in  the FPRs and FNRs. In particular, the word embeddings and the pre-trained  language models also contain ‘bias’ . Such bias is not necessarily negative, as  it reflects features and structures included in previous training datasets that may be relevant in other settings. However, such bias can and does lead to  false and potentially discriminatory predictions, depending on the concrete  application of predictions. These results highlight the importance of testing algorithms for bias under  different scenarios. For example, it may be acceptable for virtually all text containing the term ‘Muslim’ to be flagged as offensive in a situation where  well-trained human reviewers check all posts in detail before taking any  action. At the same time, while this ensures that fewer offensive comments  or posts using this term are missed, such an approach risks missing offensive  comments that do not use this term, whereby writers use different (also  proxy) words to be offensive towards Muslims, or where offensive language  is used against other groups, which is not well captured in training data or pre-trained language models focusing on specific terms. The figures above provide insights into biases on a general level. The terms  used varied, as the plural and singular (e.g. ‘gay’ and ‘gays’) and feminine and  masculine forms (mostly in the German- and Italian-language comments, as  they are gendered languages) were used. In some cases, it turns out that the  singular or plural form carries more weight in the predictions. For example, for  the English language models, the term ‘gays’ has a higher FPR than the singular  form, ‘gay’, while ‘Europeans’ has a higher FNR than ‘European’. In German and  Italian, the feminine and masculine forms are treated differently. For example,  in German, the feminine form of ‘Muslim’ has a lower FPR than the masculine form in model 1, but this is reversed in model 2. Section 3.4.3 will look more  closely into differences due to the gender of nouns in German and Italian.
63 3.4.2. Differences in predictions across selected test sentences The differences in predictions across selected identity terms for the same  sentences stem from the bias the terms introduce in the predictions. Hence,  simply using certain terms makes the algorithms more or less likely to predict  offensive comments. This is more clearly exemplified in Table 1, where the  predicted probabilities of one selected sentence are shown. The sentence  is simply the statement ‘I am […]’, ‘ ich bin […] ’ or ‘ sono […] ’, with the […]  populated with various identity terms. Table 1 provides the predictions for  selected religious identities: Buddhists, Christians, Jews and Muslims. The results vary across terms, languages, models and genders. The Germanlanguage models show the most similarities across gender and religious  identities. In those models, the average prediction is between 18 % and 23 %  (where 100 % indicates 100 % certainty of the model that the comment/ text is offensive), and the models vary from 1 % to 49 %. Hence, in general, comments are predicted to be non-offensive in all the examples, which is  unsurprising, as the sentences are not offensive. There is only a very slight  tendency for sentences using the term ‘Muslim’ to have a higher average  prediction of being offensive, but this is by only a few percentage points.  There is also a slightly higher tendency for the masculine term for Christian  in German to be predicted as offensive than for the feminine term. The English-language models’ predictions differ hugely for the identity terms.  ‘I am Christian’ is predicted to have a very low probability of being offensive  (between 2 % and 9 %). This may also be linked to the potential double meaning  in English, as it could also refer to the name Christian. ‘I am Buddhist’ gets a  higher score, but is still not generally predicted as offensive (ranging from 2 %  to 23 %). The sentence ‘I am Jewish’ has low predictions for model 2 (5 %) and  model 1 (9 %). However, model 3 predicts an 86 % likelihood of the sentence  being offensive. This model is based on existing language models, which  apparently have learned that the term ‘Jewish’ alone signifies an offensive  comment. This tendency is even stronger when it comes to the term ‘Muslim’,  which has an average prediction of being offensive of 72 %. Models 1 and  3 provide over 90 % certainty that the sentence ‘I am Muslim’ is offensive. The Italian-language models also vary considerably in predicting this sentence  according to the identity terms used. All of the terms have higher predictions than the other models in the other languages (hence, the differences are only  due to the training data used). While average predictions for ‘ sono buddhista ’  remain below 50 %, those for Christians and Jews are 50 % and above. For these  two identity terms, model 3 predicts a low probability of offensiveness, while  model 1 predicts a very high probability of offensiveness. Hence, the training  data are mainly responsible for the higher predictions, which are then lowered  by the external models containing more information showing that such text  is actually not offensive. Compared with the models in the other languages,  the terms linked to Muslims, musulmana and musulmano,  have the highest  likelihood of being predicted to be offensive. What is more, the models in Italian  language show considerable differences in relation to the gender of the terms.  While the feminine terms for Christian and Muslim get higher predictions of  being offensive than their masculine counterparts, this is the other way round  for Jew, for which the masculine version is predicted to be more offensive. These differences are notable, as they may not only lead to biased results in  predictions for offensive comments, but they actually indicate potential real  differences in the way hatred and offensive comments are expressed online.  This provides some evidence of gendered and intersectional discrimination and hatred against those groups, with more negative outcomes for Muslim  and Christian women than for Muslim and Christian men, and more negative  outcomes for Jewish men than for Jewish women.

F, feminine; M, masculine; N, neutral. Another example of biases in predictions concerns the regional origin. This  is exemplified below using two invented sentences that indicate violent  speech. One sentence expresses anger over a violent statement by saying  that ‘I hate if someone thinks that all […] should be killed’. The other sentence  expresses a very violent statement: ‘I think that all […] should be killed’. The  […] was populated with identity terms. Figure 11 shows the predictions of  the sentences as being offensive or not based on the models developed for  this project across the three languages for the terms ‘African’ and ‘European’.
65 The upper panel of Figure 11 shows the results of the average predictions  for the three models in German language. Average predictions are given,  because the sentences were used in isolation, but also with additional,  random text to allow for more variation in the predictions. The additional  random text was the same for all identity terms and hence does not have an  impact on the differences shown. This panel shows that only model 1 has a  lower likelihood of predicting both sentences containing the term ‘European’  as offensive, compared with ‘African’. The other two models are relatively  similar for the two identity terms. Interestingly, the first sentence, indicating  that someone hates the fact that someone has violent thoughts, receives  higher predictions, most likely because of the additional word ‘hate’. This is  a good example of such models reacting more to specific terms rather than  the context or meaning of the sentence. Model 3 was particularly likely to  predict the first sentence as offensive, but not the second one. A similar result can be found for the English-language models. The first  sentence gets considerably higher predictions, and the predictions are all  fairly equal between the terms. Hence, no bias was detected. For the second,  very violent, sentence, only model 3 shows a strong difference, with a lower  prediction for ‘European’ than for ‘African’. The models in Italian language are different. All models for both sentences  are strongly biased, with much higher predictions for the sentences including  the term ‘African’ than for those including the term ‘European’. The models  do not differentiate much between the two sentences. Model 3 is extreme FIGURE 11:  A VERAGE PREDICTIONS OF VIOLENT SPEECH BY SELECTED ORIGINS (%) 335081 575086 95 5797 95 5796 3761 1185 87972550 2951 50 25 52 94352 984 829097 2755 2I hate if someone thinks that all [...] should be killed I think that all [...] should be killedde en it model 1 model 2 model 3 model 1 model 2 model 30255075100 0255075100 0255075100Predicted probability of being offensive African European Source:  FRA , 2022
66 in being almost 100 % sure that the same sentence is offensive if it includes  the term ‘African’ and almost certain that the sentence is inoffensive if it  includes the term ‘European’. This again shows biases against historically  disadvantaged groups in Europe, where people of African descent face high  levels of hatred and discrimination.103 It also shows the inability to detect  potential hate speech against other groups. These results also show how such algorithms easily react to single words in  relation to predictions, which is problematic. The relevance of certain terms in offensive speech detection can be further investigated through machine  learning libraries that provide explanations of the relevance of certain features  of a model leading to certain predictions. The very fact that such algorithms overreact to certain terms is understood  by users of online platforms, who use this knowledge to avoid their offensive  comments being singled out or to avoid being blocked. For example, some  users posting hate speech use the word ‘Juice’ instead of ‘Jews’ to avoid  detection.104 To further investigate the behaviour of the trained models, the explainability  library LIME105 was used to generate explanations for the offensiveness  predictions of each model. LIME assigns a value to each word, indicating  how much that word contributed to the model’s prediction of the comment  as offensive or non-offensive. How the model 3 output for selected phrases  shows what influences high FPRs is explained below. Figure 12 shows two examples from English-language model 3. The phrases  used are ‘love all Irish. Muslims’ and ‘I am a lesbian’ (in the first case, two  identity terms were used to see the influence of each of them). Both phrases  were assessed as highly likely to be offensive (94 % and 95 % likelihood  of being offensive, respectively). The LIME explanations show that the  word ‘Muslims’ in the first example and the word ‘lesbian’ in the second  example are almost exclusively responsible for the phrase being predicted  to be offensive. In the first example, the word ‘love’ actually contributes to  the phrase being less likely to be offensive, but this does not come close to  counteracting the negative contribution of the other words. The word ‘Irish’ , in  contrast to ‘Muslims’, has no major impact (it makes the phrase only slightly  less likely to be predicted to be offensive). The fact that the word ‘love’ reduces the likelihood of content being rated  as offensive was discussed by researchers, and can be used to evade hate  speech detection algorithms.106 In our example, the phrase ‘Kill all Europeans’  is rated as 73 % likely to be offensive. The phrase ‘Kill all Europeans. Love’ is predicted to be only 45 % likely to be offensive. Simply adding the word  ‘love’ may mean that text is predicted to be non-offensive (depending on  the threshold for offensiveness).

68 To round up the analysis of biases in offensive speech detection based on  the present datasets and algorithms, an overall statistical analysis of the  importance of all words in relation to higher scores was carried out across all  models and test sentences. A regression analysis was carried out, analysing  the offensiveness prediction for each of the phrases including each of the  words as predictors and including metadata such as model and label. The  models in German and Italian languages also included the gender used in  the sentence as a predictor. In the models in English language, the most  important words leading to higher predictions of offensiveness are general or negative words. These include ‘disgust’, ‘someone’, ‘if’, ‘thinks’, ‘hate’ and  ‘stupid’. Those are followed by the words ‘gay(s)’, ‘Jew(s)’ and ‘Muslim(s)’. On  the other side, the following words reduce the likelihood of offensiveness predictions: ‘send’, ‘back’, ‘primitive’, ‘think’ and ‘love’. The results of this analysis indicate which words included in the test dataset  are relevant for offensiveness predictions. The results again reflect the level  of hatred that is associated with those terms in the training dataset. They  show a high level of hatred against gay people, Jews and Muslims. Using such  identity terms in online conversations strongly indicates offensive speech,  but also leads to algorithms falsely predicting offensive language. In the models in German language, the terms ‘ widerlich ’ (‘disgusting’),  ‘Asylanten’ (‘male asylum seekers’ – colloquial), ‘ Klemptner’ (‘male plumber’),  ‘hässlich’ (‘ugly’), ‘blöde’ (‘stupid’) and ‘Afrikaner’ (‘male African’), but also  ‘Frau’ (‘woman’), strongly contributed to higher offensiveness ratings. Words  reducing the likelihood of offensiveness predictions are ‘ primitive ’ (‘primitive’),  ‘nutzlos’ (‘useless’), ‘liebe’ (‘love’) and ‘denke’ (‘think’). The following words increase offensiveness predictions in the models in  Italian language: ‘ musulmani ’ (‘Muslims’), ‘ musulmana’ (‘female Muslim’),  ‘musulmane ’ (‘male Muslim’), ‘stranieri ’ (‘foreigners’), ‘schifoso ’ (‘lousy’),  ‘Africani ’ (‘Africans’), ‘ Africana ’ (‘female African’) and ‘ Nigeriana ’ (‘female  Nigerian’). Words relevant for reducing offensiveness predictions are ‘ europee ’  (‘male European’), ‘ itedeschi ’ (‘Germans’), ‘ odio’ (‘hate’), ‘tedesche ’ (‘German’)  and ‘queere’ (‘queer’). Gendered words were used for the test datasets in German and Italian  language. The overall analysis shows that masculine versions of identity  terms, on average and across the models and phrases, tend to very minimally  reduce the likelihood of offensiveness predictions. This means that they are very slightly less often associated with offensiveness. The topic of gender  in the predictions is further discussed in Section 3.5 below. In general, the results show that the targets or groups affected by bias varied  between languages, highlighting a shortcoming of the test dataset approach  to detecting bias: only pre-selected identity terms were investigated. Such a  method, if the initial templates are constructed with a high level of language  and cultural insight, can certainly highlight the existence of bias in a model,  but it is not well suited to detecting all possible forms of unwanted bias. The  wrong choice of template word (e.g. in German, including ‘Asylant’ (‘asylum  seeker’) or ‘ Flüchtling ’ (‘refugee’) in the identity terms) could miss some  possible source of bias in a model. Furthermore, the language models are  trained on such huge bodies of text that they may include some correlations  that fall outside our preconceived notions of grounds for prejudice. Word embeddings are already used in many NLP applications, and are now  being supplanted by pre-trained language models. If embedded into offensive  speech detection models, such applications range from content moderation  systems on social media to online police surveillance. Even in this limited 
69 context, the consequences of bias can be severe: negative stereotyping,  censorship or online harassment. But NLP technologies have even wider  application, for example to screen employment candidates’ cover letters or  curriculum vitae, or to create chatbots. Potential limitations and discriminatory  outcomes of NLP applications need to be well understood before they are  widely deployed and scaled up. Bias may be picked up not only in relation to the content of the text, but also in relation to the  way people speak. Based on previous research, this research also included additional analysis  that tested the offensive speech detection models for potential bias in relation to the dialect used. This means that the content of posts may be misclassified not only because of the  identity terms used, but also because of the way the author of a post uses language. To check for possible bias in relation to the dialect used in posts, dialect predictions of the  training data were compared with offensiveness predictions. The likelihood of comments  using African American English was established using the so-called Slang Library.* This analysis shows that there is a correlation between data being labelled as offensive  and the probability that a comment is written in the African American English dialect. This applies to the comments labelled as offensive and non-offensive in all three models, except non-offensive comments in model 1. The increased likelihood of posts associated with African American English being labelled as offensive even goes beyond the fact that the training data may be biased in such a way. The rate of predicting comments that were rated  as not offensive by the research team but as offensive by the algorithm is higher among  those posts more likely to be associated with the African American English dialect. Figure 14 shows this result of this analysis.

70 3.5. RESUL TS OF GENDER BIAS IN OFFENSIVE SPEECH  DETECTION The results in the preceding sections indicate that there are gender differences  in predictions of offensive speech. As German and Italian are more nuanced  languages in relation to gender than English, the gender variations in the  identity terms can also be investigated for those languages. The variation in the predictions of offensiveness can be explained to some  extent by looking at the metadata of all the invented test sentences, including  the type of sentence, the model, the label and the gender used in the text.  This analysis shows that, if a gendered sentence or word is included in any  of the phrases used to test the algorithms, masculine terms lead to slightly  lower predictions of offensiveness. This means that feminine words or  names are more likely to be offensive according to the training dataset used.  However, in this specific overall analysis, there is only a very small difference.  On average, the offensiveness rating of a comment in the German-language  dataset is one percentage point lower for phrases using the masculine version  of terms than for those using the feminine version. In the Italian-language  models, the use of masculine identity terms leads to a 3 % lower prediction  of offensiveness on average. This result indicates a very slight tendency for more hatred against women  in the training data. However, it does not necessarily mean that there are  more errors in the classifications. There are some differences in the error  rates by gender across the models. Table 2 shows the FPR (i.e. non-offensive  speech predicted as offensive) for the three models by gender of identity  terms. While there are no differences in the model 1 FPRs between genders,  This correlation is observed for all three models, as the FPR is highest for the posts with  the highest likelihood of containing African American Dialect. This confirms similar results  from existing research in the case of model 1 (logistic regression)** and in the case of model 2 (neural network).*** It also applies to offensive speech detection models based  on language models (model 3). The determination of whether this correlation actually  constitutes bias towards African American authors (e.g. because of biased labelling) would require the use of further datasets including information on the ethnic origin of authors. Such an analysis is limited because dialect predictions are not very consistent, particularly  for short strings of text. Furthermore, such an analysis could only be conducted in English, because the data and tools available to differentiate between dialects are available only in English. However, given that the results of training offensive speech detection algorithms have consistently been shown to perform worse in languages other than English, a deeper  investigation into how such models fail for various European dialects would be highly  relevant. Despite these research limitations, the results nevertheless highlight the fact that the  way people speak is picked up in offensiveness predictions, and can easily lead to biased predictions based on potentially protected characteristics. * Blodge tt, S. L., Green, L. and O’Connor, B. (2016), ‘ Demographic dialectal variation in social media:  A case study of African-American English’, Proceedings of EMNLP , pp. 1119–1130. See also the  related GitHub repository. It is in fact not possible to reliably predict a certain dialect. However, the bias found in predictions still indicates some association between the way people speak and offensiveness predictions. ** Da vidson, T., Bhattacharya, D. and Weber, I. (2019), ‘ Racial bias in hate speech and abusive  language detection datasets’, Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Abusive Language Online, pp. 25–35. *** Sap, M., Card, D., Gabriel, S., Choi, Y. and Smith, N. (2019), ‘The risk of racial bias in hate speech  detection’, Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 1668–1678.
71 model 2 considerably more often erroneously predicts masculine terms to  be offensive. This tendency is reversed in model 3. These patterns are the  same for German and Italian. The results point to different gender biases  enshrined in word embeddings and available language models. TABLE 2:  F ALSE POSITIVE RATES BASED ON GENDER USED IN IDENTITY  TERMS IN GERMAN- AND ITALIAN-LANGUAGE MODELS Language Model Feminine (%) Masculine (%) de 1 21 20 de 2 17 26 de 3 17 14 it 1 44 44 it 2 55 63 it 3 40 27 The above analysis only looks into the impact of selected gendered identity terms in a test dataset for differences across predictions of offensiveness.  The results indicate the gendered nature of online hatred and its influence on  predictive models. The findings also indicate that there is an intersection in  relation to hatred against people based on gender and ethnic origin. Table 1 in  Section 3.4.2 shows that the feminine term for ‘Christian’ in Italian (‘ Cristiana ’)  is rated more negatively than its masculine counterpart (‘ Cristiano ’). In  addition, the feminine version of ‘Muslim’ in Italian (‘ Musulmana ’) gets a  more negative rating than its masculine counterpart (‘Musulmano’). On the other hand, the masculine term for ‘Jew’ (‘ Ebreo’) is rated more negatively  than its feminine counterpart (‘ Ebrea ’) in some models. This may indicate  gendered hatred in training datasets that could reflect actual differences  in hatred expressed, but also different ratings in the labelling process and  different interactions picked up in the pre-trained models. It is important to note that such gender differences and intersections are  only one area of gendered bias. Women in particular face considerable hatred  online, which is often expressed through direct attacks against women  participating in online conversations. Female politicians are frequently  subjected to gendered hate campaigns and attacks as a result of hatred  against women.107 Online hatred directed at women is also often accompanied  by threats of sexual violence. In 2012, 20 % of women aged 18–29 in the EU reported having experienced forms of sexual cyber-harassment. 108 The example of bias based on the gender of a noun in German and Italian adds another dimension to the discussion of gender-based online hatred. It  indicates that gender bias should be considered in assessments of algorithms  that are used for speech detection tasks. Hatred and discrimination are often  intersectional. For example, people may primarily discriminate against people  based on their gender in combination with their ethnic origin. Such incidents  may not be picked up if not included in training data, and may also lead to biased predictions owing to the potentially gendered nature of hatred.
72 3.6. ADDRESSING BIAS IN SPEECH DETECTION:  CONCLUDING POINTS The results in this section are telling. Speech detection algorithms rely heavily  on certain words as indicators of offensiveness. The terms ‘Muslim’, ‘gay’  and ‘Jew’ lead to considerably higher predictions of offensiveness than do  other terms for the models developed for this report. These differences vary  across languages and speech detection models. This bias partly exists because algorithms built in this way are not able to take  contextual information into account. More advanced methodologies, using  word correlations from other data sources, can mitigate this issue to some  extent. However, these advanced methodologies rely on existing generalpurpose AI tools, which suffer from bias as well. So, these may not necessarily  mitigate bias. Rather, they could increase or introduce certain biases. There is  much ongoing research to try to mitigate bias in available general-purpose AI  language tools,109 for example by using different strategies to reduce societal  biases in the original model. However, the development of ‘neutral’ training  data with respect to certain characteristics, such as gender and ethnic origin,  raises the question of the extent to which such predictions should actually  be neutral. If the prevalence of offensive online speech against these groups  is in fact higher than against other groups, more neutral training data could  also lead to problematic content being missed. Some researchers suggest  that mitigation strategies may have negative impacts, such as marginalising  the voices of vulnerable groups.110 The results show that algorithms should not be used without assessment of  bias in view of their actual use. There is no quick fix. Only a comprehensive  assessment of the fundamental rights impact allows for safe use of AI.  For any tasks to be assisted by a speech detection algorithm, users of the  algorithm need to ask themselves to what extent people with protected  characteristics may be put at a disadvantage, for example through flagging  too many or too few pieces of text as offensive, compared with other groups.  Such assessments must take into account the training data and the outcomes  of predictions for differences across potentially affected groups, as described  above. Such assessments may very well lead to the conclusion that speech  detection algorithms are not fit for purpose for certain tasks, such as automated  detection of hate speech, and that content moderation decisions need to  remain in the hands of well-trained humans. The analysis also shows that the availability of research and NLP tools in  languages other than English is lagging far behind their availability in English.  This report uncovered a clear imbalance between the tools and knowledge  available for NLP technologies in English and those available for other  languages. The performance of the models in German and Italian languages in  this report is considerably poorer than that of the English-language ones. The  focus on English in NLP development and analysis also brings the challenge  of developing tools or using approaches that do not work in other languages.  Other languages may be more context sensitive, when it comes to the use of words. They may also use more gendered terms. The analysis of German  and Italian terms by the gender of nouns shows that gender bias also exists. While considerable progress has been made in the area of NLP in recent  years, much more work is needed to safely use such tools without risking increasing discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups.

74 During the experiments for this report, several challenges facing NLP research in general  were encountered. Some of these challenges are listed here. Language divide. NLP tools are not available, or only poor-quality versions are available, for  many languages. While the English language is best served, such well-elaborated tools are  not available for other languages, such as German and even more so Italian. Computational resources: existing NLP tools require considerable computational resources  and memory capacities, which are often out of reach for independent researchers. This hampers equal access to research resources and makes it difficult to reproduce existing  research. Poor documentation: many existing NLP tools are poorly documented and unreliable.  Algorithms built on top of these ‘foundations’ are liable to unexplained errors and failures. Data availability:  ―Labelled data are not easily available for languages other than English. In order to be  effective, offensive speech detection algorithms must be trained on sufficiently large labelled datasets. During the research, such datasets were found to be difficult to obtain  in languages other than English.  ―Definitions of offensive speech – there is no standard definition of ‘offensive speech’ .  Even the much narrower term ‘hate speech’ , which has been defined in the EU by Article 1 Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008, has not yet  been given a proper operational definition in the labelling of publicly available datasets.  Often, available data may have been labelled by crowdsourced, non-expert reviewers with insufficient training. This has led to the availability of datasets with inconsistent labelling schemes, making it impossible to combine datasets and difficult to compare  results across models trained on different datasets.  ―Data protection concerns – researchers are often uncertain regarding the applicability  of data protection laws. GDPR compliance is a major concern when conducting research on datasets that potentially contain personal data. Comments made by people online,  even if in a public context, are to be considered personal data, as it is usually relatively  easy to trace the author of a comment, causing such data to fall under the purview of the GDPR. The GDPR, however, includes exceptions for the conduct and reproducibility of scientific research in the public interest (Articles 5 (1) (b) and (e), 6 (1) (e) and 89 (1)).  When the GDPR first came into force, and the requisite legal expertise was scarce in the  NLP community, researchers were inclined towards an overly restrictive interpretation of the data protection law, often refraining from collecting such data. Furthermore, even where researchers collected and labelled such datasets, they were often hesitant to share their data for data protection reasons. This partly explains the scarcity of publicly  available labelled datasets in EU languages.  ―Terms of service change frequently. Given the wealth of data available on online  platforms, collecting data from social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, is an important source for NLP research. These platforms regulate the terms under which users make content available, and their terms and services set out the possibility of  data sharing through available programming interfaces. Platforms’ terms of service  and developers’ terms of service are subject to frequent changes. In fact, most social media data, particularly those used for offensive speech research, are obtained from Twitter, which currently has the least restrictive available programming interface access  of all social media platforms. This has created a research bias towards Twitter, leaving  unanswered the question of how representative Twitter data are of social media content in general.* * See K ayser-Bril, N.

77 In 2015, when FRA asked people travelling to the EU at selected border  crossing points about their views on automated border controls, the majority  indicated their hope that this leads to less discrimination than having human  border guards carrying out checks.111 We now know that automated tools are  far from neutral, and not necessarily less discriminatory. This report shows  that bias is part of the development of algorithms. Feedback loops can and do occur, and they can increase bias and discrimination  against people. Feedback loops are biases in predictions that are exacerbated  over time, when predictions of algorithms become the basis for future  training datasets, for example in policing. In addition, the results show  that algorithms based on NLP are considerably biased in relation to certain ethnic groups. There is also a degree of bias based on gender in relation to  masculine and feminine versions of terms in German and Italian. Biases vary  considerably across different models and have different impacts, depending  on the application of algorithms. This report reveals once more that checking  AI systems thoroughly for bias and potential discrimination is necessary, so that everyone in the EU can enjoy fair, consistent decisions, free from bias  and discrimination. At the same time, it is simply not possible nor realistic to mitigate biases and  discrimination in datasets in some instances. If the data are heavily biased  against certain groups, it may be difficult to ‘unbias’ data or the predictions.  The level of bias in the predictions needs to be thoroughly assessed in relation  to the harm it may have on particular groups. Especially in areas with little  research and experiences of applying algorithms, a thorough analysis of bias  and its impact on real-world applications in relation to potential discrimination  should precede the deployment of such automation tools. In some cases, the bias will not be acceptable for the intended purpose of the  algorithm. It may then be appropriate to decide that an algorithm cannot be used and should be abandoned. Conversely, it is also important to recognise  that bias in speech detection algorithms may also lead to positive effects.  For example, it may result in increased flagging of hatred against certain  groups, which could be useful for the purpose of avoiding higher levels of  hate speech. Such over-flagging may also be counteracted by human review  of speech detection before any decisions (e.g. on post takedown or account  deletion) are made. The analysis of feedback loops in predictive policing highlights a very important  aspect of using algorithms: they influence the behaviour of people over time.  While this may be positive, if algorithms are well developed and tested, 4 LOOKING FORWARD: SHARPENING  THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS FOCUS ON  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO MITIGATE  BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION
78 there are still many ways in which they can create biases through feedback  loops. Low data quality or poorly developed machine learning algorithms  can lead to predictions that put certain groups of people at a disadvantage.  In particular, highly automated settings are prone to feedback loops, which  is why high levels of automation should not be considered in areas that have  an impact on people without meaningful human intervention and oversight at  all stages. The simulation developed for this research was relatively simple. Future assessments of feedback loops should aim to create more scenarios  that can provide better information on how people, based on protected  characteristics, can be put at a disadvantage, which may be discriminatory. Overall, this report clearly corroborates the need for more comprehensive and  thorough assessments of algorithms in terms of bias before such algorithms  are used for decision-making that can have an impact on people. At the  time of writing, the EU and other international organisations are working on  frameworks to make assessments of AI and related technologies mandatory,  including assessments of bias. Professionals interviewed for FRA’s 2020 report on artificial intelligence and  fundamental rights112 underscored that results from complex machine learning  algorithms are often very difficult to understand and explain. The current  report highlights some of these challenges. It reveals the uncomfortable reality  that there is no silver bullet for addressing bias. Feedback loops are part of  all prediction algorithms and need to be monitored. Natural language models  are embedded with bias, making it challenging and potentially impossible  to obtain neutral outputs. The EU has a rich diversity of languages. This diversity is not matched by  available tools for developing and using NLP . Any future development of  algorithms needs to be accompanied by bias measurements, which allow  a better understanding of the impact predictions have on decision-making.  Only in this way can better, more consistent and less discriminatory decisions  become a reality.

89 ANNEX I: GLOSSARY Term Description Crime observability A measure of how likely the police would be to observe a crime if present.  Deep learning A subset of machine learning, involving the use of artificial neural networks (see also  ‘Neural network’) with more than one hidden layer. Downsampling Assigning certain probabilities of recording to crime events to counteract the overly  strong predictions. Earthquake policing model A predictive policing model that relies on criminological research suggesting that  crime can spread through local environments through a contagion-like process. This is based on the assumption that, if crime occurs at a certain place, there is a higher  likelihood that another crime will take place in the vicinity.  Equalised odds metric A fairness metric that requires the false positive rates and the false negative rates for a model to be equal across all demographics of interest.  False negative A type of classification error made by classification models that perform binary labelling, as in an offensive speech detection model that predicts text as either  offensive (positive) or non-offensive (negative). If the model falsely identifies a comment as non-offensive, when it is in fact offensive, this is called a false negative. False positive See ‘False negative’ . If the model identifies a comment as offensive despite it being  rated as non-offensive in the original or test data, this is called a false positive. Feedback loop Decisions based on predictions made by the system influence the data that are then  used to retrain or update the system. Hotspot policing A strategy that considers an area of a city as a grid of cells and allocates the majority  of the police patrols to a fixed number of cells (‘hotspots’) with the highest predicted  risk of crime. Language model A system that has been trained to compute the probability of the occurrence of a number of words in a particular sequence. Systems trained in this way on a large  body of texts have been found to retain some important semantic features and are at  the heart of recent advances in NLP . Logistic regression A function often used in binary classification schemes (i.e. classification schemes  that have to choose between two possibilities). It basically transforms the question  of “what is the probability of x happening” into a linear function (using the log odds  function, which takes a probability, p, and turns it into log[p/(1 – p)]). Model In machine learning, a model is the product of training a machine learning algorithm  on training data. A simple example is if linear regression is the algorithm used for predicting the value of variable y based on the values of variable x, then the original  function will look like y = ax  + b. Once the algorithm has been trained, it will have  determined the values of a (e.g. 3) and b (e.g. 1), and then the function y = 3x + 1 is  the model that can then be used to predict y based on new input data x. Naive Bayes Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers that are based  on conditional probability, which is the probability of the occurrence of something  based on the occurrence of something else (e.g. the likelihood of a text being offensive given that the text contains the term ‘hate’).  Natural language processing The field of designing methods and algorithms that take unstructured, natural  language data as the input or produce it as the output. The goal of NLP is to create  algorithms that can process natural language, in order to perform a task, ranging from easy (such as spellchecking or keyword searching) to more complex (such as  machine translation, question answering or sentiment analysis) tasks. Neural network In machine learning, a neural network is a series of interconnected computational  units, organised into ‘layers’ , that accept multiple inputs and produce one output.  Deep neural networks consist of several layers. Observed crime The level of crime observed by the police. Offensive speech Speech that may, at a minimum, cause distress to a person. Such speech may incite  hatred or threat of violence, which may, at worst, threaten the right to life and  physical integrity of people. Overfitting A process whereby machine learning is known to potentially focus too strongly on  patterns in training data, even when those patterns are random or irrelevant to other situations.
90 Term Description Parameter In statistics, a parameter is a statistical value (such as the mean or variance) used to  describe a statistical population. In computer science, a parameter is a variable whose  value needs to be set when calling a function or subroutine of a program. Predictive policing The application of analytical techniques – particularly quantitative techniques – to  identify likely targets for police intervention and to prevent crime or solve past crimes by making statistical predictions. Pre-trained language models AI models that enshrine rules for the usage of words and language based on large  corpora of texts (e.g. Wikipedia). Rules of language are pre-trained (i.e. derived from  previous texts) and can then be applied and updated with new data for a specific task.  Probabilistic model Police patrols are distributed according to the crime distribution in historical data.  For example, 30 % of patrols are sent to the region where historical records indicate  30 % of crime occurs. Recorded crime Observed crime plus reported crime. Regularisation A technical solution that should be employed to avoid predictions from becoming too  strong. It involves adding an additional parameter to the mathematical formulae of  the algorithm. Reported crime The level of crime that is reported to police by victims or witnesses. Runaway feedback loop When feedback causes a ‘winner takes all’ situation, for example by repeatedly augmenting the number of police patrols sent to the same neighbourhood regardless  of the true crime rate.  Sampling bias This occurs when some members of a statistical population are systematically more  likely to be selected in a sample than others. Sentiment analysis The computational study of opinions, sentiments and emotions expressed in text. Transfer learning Fully trained machine learning models for word and sentence predictions, which can  be used and adapted for new tasks.  True crime rate In simulation studies, data are artificially created to simulate the reality. One of the  parameters included in such a simulation is the assumed ‘true crime rate’ , which may be different from the detected and reported crime rates. It allows for the measure  of how much the detected and reported crimes lead to biased predictions compared  with the assumed ‘true crime rate’ .  Unbiased data Where the historical data are equal to the true crime rates. Word embeddings Vector space models of language that represent each word as numbers, where words  with similar meanings also have similar numerical values.
91 ANNEX II: ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL  DETAILS OF THE SIMULATION OF  FEEDBACK LOOPS Predictive policing is a process with several actors and possible sources of biases. Consider, for example, that certain  types of crime are reported less than others,113 as is the case for crime incidents with differential observability by  police patrols.114 In general, the complexity of human behaviour and cultural socio-economic biases permeate into  historical datasets, making it difficult to keep track of all the factors influencing the process. Since the goal is to  investigate the formation of feedback loops, some of the real-life complexities can be avoided, and a more simplified  approach can be taken by focusing on the following parameters only. Crime reporting behaviour is represented in a  single parameter. The factors that influence the detection of crime include the police patrol distribution ( β) and the  observability of crime ( V). Finally, a fourth parameter is needed to reflect all crime events happening in a given city.  Figure 2 describes the components of the simulated policing process and how they are connected to one another (through the directed arrows), and the following list provides detailed descriptions of the parameters.  ―Parameter α: crime reporting rates.  These concern the reports submitted by witnesses or victims to the police. It  can differ across neighbourhoods, and was held constant during each of the simulations. The value of α is based  on data from German and Spanish victimisation surveys115 and set to 20 % (it was 22.3 % in Barcelona in 2019).  ―Parameter β: police distribution. This represents the distribution of police patrols through the districts and the  related direct observations by the police patrols. Here, it is assumed that the number of observations is directly  related to the presence of police patrols per neighbourhood. The initial parameter value was based on the  recorded crime rates in the cities (Vienna, Berlin, Madrid and Barcelona) and was set by the developers at the  beginning of the simulation. The initial value was based on 2019 car theft data from Berlin.116 This parameter  changed through the evolution of the simulation based on the respective predictions. This is the most relevant parameter for identifying the formation of (runaway) feedback loops. In fact, the system bias is measured by  looking at the difference between the true crime distribution and the value of β. The Kullback–Leibler divergence,  a common measure of the difference between two distributions, was used to measure this difference.  ―Parameter V: observability of crime. This is a measure of how likely the police are to detect a crime in a particular  neighbourhood. Observability can depend on, for example, the type of crime that is committed, with some crimes  being more likely to be detected (e.g. car theft) and others less likely (e.g. tax fraud). For experiment 1, we allow parameter  V to depend on crime  type and on district, in order to detect the impact of crime  observability on feedback loop  formation. In this context, crime  observability is taken to mean the  following: if crime type A has an  observability of 30 % in district 1,  then, if a crime of type A occurs  in district 1, and the police happen  to be patrolling there, there is a 30 % chance that they will  observe and record the crime. For  experiment 2, in order to simplify  simulations, crime type is fixed,  and observability is assumed to  be the same across all districts, so  that crime observation depends exclusively on the distribution of  patrols.  ―Parameter Ω: true crime distribution.  Compared with the analysis of a real process, the main advantage of  a simulation is that we can control parameters that are often unknown. In this case, the true distribution of  crime across neighbourhoods is a very difficult parameter to infer from the statistics of police records. It is well  documented that a proportion of crime events never enter police records (the ‘dark figure’) because they are  
92 neither observed nor reported.117 In addition, several other factors influence those statistics, such as low rates of  victims reporting crime,118 limited police resources or the so-called grey zone,119 which corresponds to crimes that  are reported to police but are not recorded in the crime statistics. Nonetheless, the simulations in this research  explore a large set of true crime rate distributions, Ω, to study the influence of the true crime rate distribution  on the formation of feedback loops.  ―Other parameters.  For the implementation of the simulation, setting some standard values is required. It is assumed  that there are, on average, 200 crime events of a certain type per month. This is, for example, the approximate number of highway robbery events in Berlin in 2019, the illegal use of drugs in Madrid recorded in April 2019  and the sum of mugging events in two neighbourhoods in Barcelona in June 2019. Additional parameters include  the duration of the simulation (number of epochs, which was equivalent to 20 and 100 years); the length of  historical data (duration of initial data: approximately 365 days) and the algorithm update frequency (duration  of each epoch: approximately seven days), equivalent to one week. In addition, experiment 1 had two settings.  The first kept all historical data, thus accumulating an ever larger dataset as the simulation progressed through  time. The second always kept only one year’s worth of data (thus, ‘forgetting’ everything that was older than one year). This second setting was also used in experiment 2. Table A1 shows the sources of crime data used to specify values of parameters.

It is part of the process of allocating police according to predictions, as shown in Figure 2. Two policing strategies are considered.  ―Allocating police patrols proportionally to the predictions made by the algorithm.  For example, if the algorithm  predicts 20 % of crime events in district 1, 20 % of police patrols are assigned to district 1. This strategy was used  mainly in simulation 1, described below, and is sometimes referred to as ‘effective policing’.  ―Hotspot policing.  This considers a city as a grid of cells (e.g. of 5 × 5 m2 each), and allocates the majority of  police patrols to the hotspots – that is, to a fixed number of cells ( n) with the highest probability of crime. For  example, if n = 5 and there is a hypothetical city with 25 cells, this strategy selects the five cells with the highest  probability of crime and dispenses the majority of police patrols to those five cells. This strategy was mainly  used in simulation 2, described below. PREDICTION ALGORITHMS Various algorithms were tested. The algorithms and models include:  ―a simple probabilistic model, which allocates police patrols according to the recorded crime rate, including reported  and detected crime, in each neighbourhood and is not based on a machine learning model (used in simulation 1);  ―simple machine learning algorithms, including so-called naive Bayes and logistic regression (used in simulation 1);  ―a more complex model, referred to as the ‘earthquake policing model’, which is described in more detail below. NUMBER OF NEIGHBOURHOODS Simulation 1 explores the case of two neighbourhoods. Using only two neighbourhoods makes visualisations easier  to understand and the effects of various parameters more clearly observable. However, simulation 1 was also 
93 conducted for more than two neighbourhoods, and runaway feedback loops were also formed in those situations.  Simulation 2 experiments were all conducted for multiple neighbourhoods. Simulation 1: Two neighbourhoods, simple statistical and machine learning models, effective policing The first simulation involves only two neighbourhoods. Initially, a general probabilistic model is used. This model  takes a simple statistical approach and assumes that police patrols should be distributed exactly according to  historical crime records. For example, if police records indicate that 70 % of crime happens in neighbourhood 1, and 30 % in neighbourhood 2, then 70 % and 30 % of patrols should be sent to neighbourhoods 1 and 2, respectively  (i.e. effective policing). This is used as a basic model to explore the interplay of the parameters and to broadly  understand the predictive policing process. The main analysis was carried out using a simple machine learning  algorithm (called naive Bayes), trained on historical crime records, which predicts the percentage of crime across  two neighbourhoods on the following day. The results of the probabilistic model were compared with the predictions  of the naive Bayes model. This enables understanding of the effect of using the different algorithms, and observes  how much the feedback loop formation process is affected by using machine learning algorithms compared with the  first simple allocation according to the proportion of recorded crime for each district. In addition, to corroborate the validity of the results, the performance of the naive Bayes model was compared with that of a logistic regression  model, another commonly used, but relatively simple, machine learning algorithm. It is important to note that the  formation of feedback loops in this context is an artefact of the system design (because the system affects the  data that are then used to update the same system) and is independent of the presence or absence of a machine  learning model for prediction. Even in the simple probabilistic setting, runaway feedback loops are formed, as shown  in previous research.120 The simulations show, however, that the inclusion of machine learning models accelerates  the formation of the runaway feedback loops, at least in settings where no mitigation measures are implemented. Simulation 2: Multiple neighbourhoods, more complex machine learning models, hotspot policing Simulation 2 uses the hotspot policing strategy and inspects its performance in several neighbourhoods, including an  example in which 2019 Berlin crime records are used. The algorithm used is a special case of a so-called self-exciting  point process. It was first introduced to predictive policing by a team of researchers that included the cofounder of  PredPol, George Mohler, in 2011.121 This is often referred to as the ‘PredPol model’ in the literature. However, it is not  clear to what extent the current commercial application corresponds to the original theoretical model described in  the literature. Therefore, the model is referred to as the ‘earthquake policing model’ in this report.122 The rationale  behind the use of the earthquake policing model for predictive policing relies on criminological research suggesting that crime can spread through local environments through a contagion-like process, 123 particularly for certain types  of crimes such as vandalism to property,124 burglary and gang violence.125 However, the use of the earthquake  policing model in the area of predictive policing has been controversial since its inception.126 This is partly due to the  underlying assumptions of the process and some incompatibilities between the nature of the earthquake policing  model and how crime emerges in cities. It has also been controversial because of the tendency of the model to  form feedback loops.127 In analogy with the published earthquake policing model,128 hotspot policing is assumed in simulation 2. This means  sending a majority of police to the n cells with the highest predicted risk of crime (the crime hotspots). We use a  ratio of 5:1, meaning five times as many police were assumed to be sent to a crime hotspot than to cells with a lower  predicted risk of crime. The earthquake policing model is used to predict the n cells with a higher risk of crime. In  the frame of simulation 2, four main experiments to study the formation of feedback loops were run.  ―The first experiment uses a grid of 5 × 5 m2 cells, with equal true crime rates across the cells and initial historical  rates distributed uniformly with the exception of five cells, which have twice the rates of the other cells to  emulate regions with higher crime rates. The simulation is run over 700 iterations (‘days’), which means there  were 700 updates when a new police assignment to visit the five cells with the highest crime rates was made.  ―The second experiment considers a non-uniform distribution of true crime rates . To set up a realistic situation,  but one that is still simple to interpret, we use crime statistics on car thefts in Berlin (2019). Furthermore, in order  to extract the ratio of the top 30 % of subdistricts with respect to the other cells, we first estimate the average rates within both (top 30 % and the remaining 70 %) groups, and calculate the division. A ratio of about 1:24 is  obtained from these data. In our simulations of a grid of 5 × 5 m2 cells, this means setting eight cells (approximately  the top 30 %) with rates higher than the rest by about 25 %. In that way, the ratio in our simulations is 1:25.  ―The third experiment also considers car theft events for a grid of 5 × 5 m2 cells with uniform true crime rates  across the cells. The total number of areas in the dataset is 138. Thus, we randomly select 25 rates for the data 
94 to be used in the experiment. We observe the simulation over 1,000 iterations, which is 1,000 simulated ‘days’  in the computer simulation.  ―The fourth experiment is similar to the third. It extracts the true crime rates from the dataset, which is equivalent  to assuming that the data are unbiased. This is probably the best setting to observing whether feedback loops form and how fast the process is. The simulation is run over 1,000 iterations (‘days’).  ―Finally, the fourth experiment was also run on the full dataset, based on 138 subdistricts of Berlin. The data are distributed on a grid of 23 × 6 m 2 cells, with historical and true crime rates corresponding to 2019 Berlin car theft  statistics. The simulation is run over 1,000 iterations (‘days’), and the police assignment will be distributed across  the 20 cells with highest predicted risk of crime.
95 ANNEX III: TECHNICAL DETAILS OF  THE OFFENSIVE SPEECH DETECTION  ANALYSIS OFFENSIVE SPEECH DETECTION ALGORITHMS NLP is the field of designing methods and algorithms that take as input or produce as output unstructured, natural  language data.129 The goal of NLP is to create algorithms that can process natural language to perform a particular  task, ranging from easy (such as spellchecking or keyword searching) to more complex (such as machine translation,  question answering or sentiment analysis) tasks.130 Early statistical models for NLP were based on very simple  supervised learning techniques. Text is decomposed into its basic units – words – without care for word order.  This  choice is by no means neutral and is indicative of an English-language bias. In languages that are morphologically  richer than English, words more often have different meanings depending on the context and grammar. Words may  not be the ideal basic unit of meaning in such languages.131 This approach of using words as input without considering  their order is called the bag-of-words approach. These ‘bags of words’ are then used as the ‘input features’ or  predictors for the task at hand. Word embeddings Word embedding is a method of mapping words onto a numerical vector space. Put more simply, this means it  transforms words into several numbers, while still preserving certain important semantic relationships. This means  that words with similar meanings are also closer together (i.e. more similar) in their numerical representation. Once the word embeddings have been established (‘learned’), they can be saved and reused in many other NLP  tasks. The use of these pre-trained word embeddings overcomes the limitation of the traditional approach, in which  classifiers only learned how to deal with words already encountered in the training set. Another strong appeal  of the word embeddings method is that it is unsupervised. It requires a lot of text data, but no labelling, as the  ‘closeness’ of words is drawn from existing text. Thus, the pre-trained word embeddings can encompass ever larger  vocabularies. Furthermore, the embeddings preserve some form of semantic relationship. This refers, in essence,  to the probability of a given word belonging in a particular context, ‘learned’ from the vast corpora used during  training of the word embedding. This allows subsequent models to take advantage of the semantic relationships  already encoded in the word representations. In general, huge bodies of text datasets were required to train the word embeddings, and these were taken from  the internet. Wikipedia and selected social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit are among the most popular  sources. However, it soon transpired that not all associations learned from such text datasets were desirable. The  first research paper to reach public consciousness and raise the alarm was entitled ‘Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker? Debiasing word embeddings’. 132 This demonstrated that word embeddings preserved  gender-biased associations, and proposed a mathematical procedure for debiasing the word vector space. Using  similar techniques, the article ‘Black is to criminal as Caucasian is to police: Detecting and removing multiclass bias  in word embeddings’133 tackled the issue of detecting and mitigating racial bias in word embeddings. Caliskan  et  al.134 followed a different strategy. They developed the word embedding association test, based on the implicit  association test from psychology.135 With the help of this test, they were able to detect a wide variety of human  biases in word embeddings trained on large public corpora. Finally, using the word embedding association test to  conduct experiments on some gender-debiased embeddings,136 Gonen and Goldberg137 point out that debiasing  techniques could be merely hiding the bias, rather than removing it. Much of the research on bias in word embeddings is based on English. One study on bias in German word embeddings138  finds that debiasing methods developed in English are not appropriate for gendered languages, and suggests that a debiasing method for German should be developed. Unfortunately, no pre-trained debiased German word vectors  were provided. For this research, only the ConceptNet139 word embeddings for pre-trained and debiased word vectors  in languages other than English could be found.
96 Language models The early generation of word embeddings, as described above, were context independent (i.e. each word has exactly  one embedding, regardless of context). The subsequent generation of word embeddings, such as GPT,140 ELMo141  and ULMFiT,142 produced embeddings of words in context, so that the vector representation of a word depended  also on its neighbouring words. Shortly thereafter, starting in 2019, large-scale pretrained language models were  developed, such as BERT,143 GPT-2,144 GPT-3,145 RoBERTa,146 T5147 and BART.148 The distinguishing feature of these  language models is that they are fully trained machine learning models. Unlike the pre-trained word embeddings,  which used machine learning to produce word vectors that could be used for downstream tasks, the model itself is  used in a downstream task (after only some initial ‘fine-tuning’ per task). An example of this is known as ‘transfer  learning’. This process is based on two novelties. The first is that the unsupervised task used to pre-train the models usually involves not only word predictions, but also next-sentence prediction. The second, and more significant, is  that a new underlying neural network architecture – transformers – was used. 149 These language models have been  competing with each other in terms of sheer size of vocabularies used in training, and in terms of the number of  parameters included in their feature space.150 Their promise is that, after the initial expense of developing (‘training’)  such models, they can be used as the foundation for other algorithms, which can fine-tune them and be adopted  to accomplish downstream tasks with limited amounts of labelled training data. In fact, with this potential in mind,  over 100 researchers convened at Stanford University in August 2021 to announce a new paradigm in the field of  machine learning: foundation models.151 This development was met with some scepticism. As noted by Marcus and  Davis,152 “Large pretrained statistical models can do almost anything, at least enough for a proof of concept, but  there is precious little that they can do reliably”. Furthermore, evidence is mounting that language models are subject to the same issues of bias as word embeddings.  Research indicates that gender, racial153 and religious154 stereotypes are embedded in the pretrained language models.  Methods to properly measure this bias are being investigated, since the tools developed for word embeddings do not necessarily adapt well to language models. 155 While there have been attempts to develop strategies to remove  the bias in language models,156 research indicates that such debiasing efforts might have negative consequences for  marginalised voices.157 The negative effect could be that debiasing could lead to diminished model performance on  language used by minority groups. The potential for bias is particularly troubling in the context of pre-trained language  models as building blocks in countless other NLP models for a wide range of tasks. Without a better understanding of how the bias propagates into downstream tasks, and effective measures for mitigating it, there is a serious risk  of perpetuating and exacerbating biases and discrimination picked up by the pretrained language models. ALGORITHMS USED FOR DEVELOPING THE MODELS Models based on three different machine learning algorithms were developed using publicly available labelled  datasets in English,158 German159 and Italian,160 as described above.  ―Model 1. This is a simple bag-of-words approach using logistic regression, as in Davidson et al.161  ―Model 2. This is a deep neural network and word embeddings approach. For this algorithm, two initial choices  had to be made: the particular word embeddings and the choice of the neural network architecture. As for word  embeddings, an initial investigation into GloVe162 showed that no pre-trained embeddings of comparable size and  quality exist in English, German and Italian. While the embeddings that were used ( fastText163) were available  in all three languages, the English-language embeddings were unavoidably larger. However, all embeddings  were trained within the same framework to ensure a higher chance of consistent quality. fastText also makes the claim that it is better suited to morphologically more complex languages, by training not just on words, but  combining subword information in its algorithm training procedure.164 For the algorithm, convolutional neural  network and gated recurrent unit architectures were tested. To allow for comparison, the baseline architectures were taken from Park et al. 165 and the Conversationai GitHub.  ―Model 3.  To train an offensive speech detection model using pre-trained models, we used the Hugging Face  Transformers library. This is an open-source library, which contains implementations of many of the state-of-the-art language models. The DistilBERT 166 implementation was used during development runs. In the end, the  development used the BERT167 and RoBERTa168 multilingual versions. In all three languages, the BERT-based  models performed the best. Each algorithm was trained separately on each of the three datasets, giving a total of nine models to be used in testing for bias. Algorithm training involves several choices that need to be made. As indicated above, several alternatives were  investigated in order to find the best results. For example, for model 2, a choice needed to be made between 
97 convolutional neural network or gated recurrent unit neural network architectures. Other details needed to be  decided experimentally, and therefore it is common practice to split data into the following three sets.  ―Training dataset. This is used to train each algorithm, and obtain a model.  ―Validation dataset. This is used to test the trained model performance, in order to choose the ‘best’ one.  ―Test dataset.  Once a ‘best’ model has been identified, it is retrained on a combined dataset of training and  validation data. Its performance is then tested on the test data, and this is what is reported when giving the  model performance. For the bias analysis, an additional dataset was used for testing for bias. This dataset was generated from templates  to test for bias against various identities. It includes invented text phrases that were used to obtain predictions of  offensiveness. This dataset is referred to as the ‘bias test dataset’, and is described in more detail below. DATASETS (TRAINING DATA) USED TO BUILD OFFENSIVE SPEECH DETECTION  ALGORITHMS Table A2 provides an overview of the data used for the offensive speech detection model training conducted for  this research, which were all based on actual social media comments. English- and Italian-language models were  trained on data from one dataset only. Owing to the limited dataset size and quality, two datasets were combined  in order to train the German-language models. Before commencing the model training, all datasets were reduced  to one field containing the comment and one field containing the offensiveness label. No other variables were  used in the model development process. Amnesty International Italy kindly granted permission for the use of the Italian-language dataset. 169 TABLE A2:  CHARACTERIS TICS OF TRAINING DATA CharacteristicsLanguage en it de Dataset name Founta et al.170Barometro171GermEval172Zenodo173 Total number of samples/ observations99,996 132,868 15,418 27,216 Number of samples after  processing91,633 108,399 15,410 26,953 Offensive (%) 27 8 33 2 Used samples Non-offensive:  67,006 (73 %) Offensive: 24,627  (27 %)Non-offensive: 30,177 (75 %) Offensive: 10,059  (25 %)Non-offensive: 10,322 (67 %) Offensive: 5,088  (33 %)Non-offensive: 26,328 (98 %) Offensive: 625 (2 %) Platform Twitter Facebook (55 %)  and Twitter (45 %)Twitter Twitter Collection period 2018 2018–2020 2018–2019 2018–2019 Context of data collection Development of  automated offensive  language detection  algorithmsTreatment of women and LGBT  people; European  Parliamentary electionsIdentification of offensive languageData collection on hate speech in  journalism Associated institution Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,  Cyprus University of Technology,  Telefónica Research,  University of Alabama at  Birmingham,  University College  London Amnesty International ItalySaarland University, Darmstadt University  of Applied Sciences, Leibniz-Institut für  Deutsche SpracheDataScouting,  International Hellenic  University

Various  identity terms were developed and used (e.g. German, Irish, Muslim, migrant) to test for biases across different  protected characteristics. These are indicated in the ‘Collective noun’ columns in Table A3. The missing words were  filled in from lists in order to generate an approximately equal number of offensive and negative sentences for each  identity term. The same templates and word lists were translated into all three languages. The German and Italian sentences also used gendered terms. Overall, this led to a dataset of over 7,300 sentences, in which about half of  the sentences were rated by the research team as offensive and the other half were rated as non-offensive. The  German- and Italian-language bias test datasets were twice as large as the English-language one, because the terms  were gendered. Each of the example sentences in each language was predicted for its offensiveness in each of three  models. This led to over 110,000 predictions, which were investigated for bias according to the identity terms used. Table A3 provides examples of sentences developed for testing bias in the models. The sentences were largely kept  the same, with only certain selected terms being changed.

PERFORMANCE OF ALGORITHMS This section provides an overview of the overall performance of algorithms in terms of accurately detecting offensive  comments. After the three models were trained in each of the three languages (English, German and Italian), their  performance was evaluated on the test datasets. The so-called F1-score was used to capture how well the offensive  comments were being predicted. The F1-score is a metric of model performance for classification models that have  to identify only two classes (‘positive’ or ‘negative’). It is often used when trying to measure how well a model  detects the ‘positive’ class, especially when the ‘positive’ class makes up a smaller proportion of the test data. The  results are summarised in Table A4, alongside several commonly used performance metrics for each of the models,  on different datasets. All three English-language models significantly outperformed the corresponding models in German and Italian. This  is true for the test set performance, and for the bias test set performance. All languages and all models showed a big drop in performance between their results on the test set and their  results on the bias test set. The test set, as described above, while not used in the training of the models, was sampled from the same data as  the training data, and thus has the same statistical and linguistic properties. The bias test set, on the other hand, has different statistical properties, and this led to a severe drop in performance. In English, even the simple model performed very well on the test set, and the extra computing power and resources  used to train the neural networks solution (model 2) and the language model (model 3) resulted in only marginal improvements. This raises the question of whether the marginal gain in performance is worth the extra cost and  complexity of developing models 2 and 3. Simple algorithms, such as the logistic regression used for model 1, are fully determined once the training data  and some initial parameters are known. This means that, given the same data, and the same initial parameters,  the same logistic regression model will always be built. This is not the case for more complex models, which often  involve several random starting points. There are methods for ensuring that results can be reproduced when the  same data, the same parameters and the same system set-up are used. Unfortunately, neural networks can be  so complex that this is not guaranteed. To check the reproducibility of the experiment results, once the optimal  architecture had been obtained, models 2 and 3 were retrained 10 times, and each of the 10 versions of each model was used to evaluate all the datasets. Model 3 versions were stable, and all reproduced the original model. Model 2  results varied to some extent in English and Italian, meaning there was some amount of reproducibility. However,  the German-language model 2 versions varied significantly, and suffered a great drop in performance. The reasons for this failure in reproducibility could not be established in the frame of this research (see the box ‘Challenges and  limitations encountered when researching bias in speech detection’ in Chapter 3).
