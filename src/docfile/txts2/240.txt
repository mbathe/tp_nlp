4 Abstract  Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers the potential to transform our lives in radical ways. However, n ot only do we  lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even underestimate   what various technologies in AI a re capable of today. Certainly, the translation from scientific papers and  benchmark performance to products is faster in AI than in other non-digital sectors. However, it is often  the  case that research breakthroughs do not directly translate to a technology that is ready to use in real -world  environments. This document describes an exampl e-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI  technologies, by mapping them o nto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (e.g., maturity and availability levels).  We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI and identify different categories in AI to which they can be  assigned. We then introduce new bidimensional plots, called readiness -vs-generality charts, where we see that  higher TRLs are achievable for low -generality technologies focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while low  TRLs are still out of reach for more general capabilities. We include numerous examples of AI technologies in a  variety of fields, and show their readiness -vs-generality charts, serving as a base for a broader discussion of AI  technologies . Finally, we use the dynamics of several AI technology at different generality levels  and moments  of time to forecast some short -term and mid -term trends for AI.  
5 Executive summary   We are still lack the capacity to predict what capabilities and products will become  a reality even in the short  term, a problem that is not particular for AI but any technology, and especially digital technologies. We are not  always successful, even in hindsight , in understanding why some expectations are not met, and why some AI  technologies have limitations  or what kind of new technologies may replace them. Moreover,  although  many  so-called breakthroughs in AI are associated with highly cited  research pape rs or good performance in some  particular benchmarks, research breakthroughs do not directly translate into a technology that is ready to use in real -world environments.   In this paper, we present a novel ex ample-based methodology to categorise and assess s everal AI research and  development technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (representing their maturity and availability). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI, and identify several categories in  AI to which th ey can be assigned. The selection of technologies is representative but not exhaustive : it is based  on our own experience and knowledge  in the area  about their relevance and “general use”. Furthermore, for  some specific cases, we have also considered the a ssociated levels of research activity .  We then introduce new bidimensional plots, called readiness -vs-generality charts, in which we define the  degree of generality (in terms of being able to  function over many diverse specific domains  and tasks ) expected  for a particular technology on the x -axis vs the readiness level (the TRLs) on the y -axis. Generality is a key  element to be recognise d, apart from the readiness levels  since  AI is a field that develops (cognitive)  capabilities at different generality  levels . Consequently, we need to assign readiness levels according to  different levels  of generality: a technology that is specialised for a very specific, controlled, domain may reach  higher TRL than a technology that has to be more general -purpose in terms of it not- being restricted to specific  tasks or scenarios . Therefore, for each technology we define the different levels  of capabilities based on a  comprehensive analysis of the related scientific and industrial lite rature. We also include examples of AI  technologies in a variety of fields and  show their readiness -vs-generality charts  (see Table 1).   Tabl e 1: AI categories and the sample of representative technologies evaluated for each of them.   Category  Technology   Knowledge Representation & Reasoning  Expert Systems   Learning  Recommender Systems   Apprentices by Demonstration   Communication  Machine Translation   Speech Recognition   Perception  Facial Recognition   Text Recognition   Planning  Transport & Scheduling Systems   Physical Interaction (Robotics) Self-Driving Cars   Home Cleaning Robots   Social  & Collaborative Intelligence  Negotiation Agents   Integrating Technology  Virtual Assistants   M ethodologically, the examples  analysed  serve to illustrate the difficulties of estimating the TRLs, a problem  that is not specific to AI. The use of levels  on the x -axis, however, has helped us be more precise with the TRLs  than would be otherwise.  It should be noted that our initial assessmen t has undergone  a profound evaluation  by an independent panel of specialists, recognised in at least one of the technologies (or areas) addressed.   In the charts we see that higher TRLs are achievable for low-generality technologies focusing on narrow or  specific abilities, while low TRLs are still out of reach for more general capabilities.  Furthermore, the shapes of  the curves seen in the charts of the previous section are informative about where the real challenges are for  some technologies . Consequently, it seems that those curves that are flatter look more promising than those  for which there is a steep step at some level  on the x -axis.  We use the dynamics of several AI technology 
  6   examples  at different generality level s and moments of time to forecast some short -term and mid -term trends  for AI. Finally, we illustrate that technological readiness does not mean technological success as well as the  potential  danger s of excessive focus on TRL  when developing new AI technologies  and the conseque nt  criticisms related to the lack of generality of current AI technologies.    Valuable contributions of this work are: (1) the definition of the maturity levels for an illustrative set of AI  technologies through the use of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) a ssessment. (2) The interpretation  of the  nine TRLs (introduced by NASA and adapted by the EU) in the context of AI, and then its systematic application  to different categories in AI, by choosing one or two ex amples in each category. (3) The development of new  bidimensional plots, known as readiness -vs-generality charts, as a trade -off between how general  a technology  is versus its readiness level. (4) The analysis of numerous examples of AI technologies in a variety of fields  by  means of the readiness -vs-generality charts. (5) The  discussion about the future of AI as a transformative  technology and how the readiness -vs-generality charts are useful  for short -term and mid -term forecasting.         
  7   Foreword   This report  is published in the context of  AI WATCH , the European  Commission  knowledge  service to monitor  the development,  uptake and  impact of Artificial Intelligence  (AI) for Europe,  launched in December 2018.    AI has become an area of strategic importance with potential to be a key driver of economic  development.  AI also has a wide range of potential  social implications.  As part of its Digital Single Market  Strategy, the European Commission put forward in April 2018 a European strategy on AI in its  Communication  "Artificial Intelligence for Europe" COM(2018)237.  The aims  of the European AI strategy announced in  the communication  are:   — To boost the EU's technological and industrial capacity and AI uptake across the economy, both by the  private and public sectors     — To prepare  for socio -economic changes brought about by AI    — To ensure  an appropriate ethical and legal framework.    Subsequently,  in December 2018, the European Commission and the Member States published a  “Coordinated  Plan on Artificial Intelligence ”, COM(2018)795,  on the development of AI in the EU.  The Coordinated Plan  mentions the role of AI Watch to monitor its implementation.    AI WATCH monitors  European Union’ s industrial, technological and research capacity  in AI;  AI-related  policy  initiatives in the Member States;  uptake and technical de velopments of AI;  and AI impact. AI WATCH has a  European focus within the global landscape.  In the context of AI Watch, the Commission works in coordination  with Member States.  AI WATCH results  and analyses  are published on the AI WATCH Portal1.   From  AI Watch  in-depth analyses, we will be able to better understand E U’s areas of strength and areas where  investment  is needed.  AI Watch will provide an independent assessment of the impacts and benefits of AI on  growth, jobs, education, and society.    AI Watch is developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission in collaboration with  the Directorate -General  for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT).    This report addresses the following objectives of AI WATCH : Analysis of the evolution  of AI technologies. As  part of this objective this report particularly aims to introduce  an ex ample-based methodology to categorise  and assess several AI research and development technologies, by mapping them into Technology Readi ness  Levels (TRL) .    1 https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai- watch_en   
  8   1 Introduction     Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to have a transformative effect on almost every aspect of our lives, from the  viewpoint of individuals, groups, companies,  and governments. While there are certainly many obstacles to  overcome, AI has the potential to empower our daily lives in the immediate future. A great deal of this  empowerment comes through the amplification of human abilities. Another important space AI  systems are  taking over comes from the opportunities of an increasingly more digitised and ‘datafied’2 world. Overall, AI is  playing an important role in several sectors and applications, from virtual digital assistants in our smartphones to medical di agnosis systems. The impact on the labour market is already very visible, but the workplace may  be totally transformed in the following years.    However, there is already a high degree of uncertainty even when it comes to determining whether a problem  can be solved or an occupation can be replaced by AI today  (Brynjolfsson et al. 2018, Martínez -Plumed et al.  2020). The readiness of AI seems to be limited to (1) areas that use and produce a sufficient amount of data and have clear objectives about what the business is trying to achieve; (2) scenarios where the suitable  algorithms, approaches and software have been developed to make it fully functional into their relevant fields; and (3) situations whose costs of deployment are affordable (including data, expe rt knowledge, human  oversight, software resources, computing cycles, hardware and network facilities, development time, etc., apart from monetary costs) (Martínez- Plumed et al. 2018a). To make things more complicated, AI is not one  big, specific technology , but it rather consists of several different human -like and non -human- like capabilities,  which currently have different levels of development (e.g., from research hypotheses and formulations to more  deployed commercial applications). At a high level, AI i s composed of reasoning, learning, perception, planning,  communication, robotics and social intelligence. At a lower level, there are a myriad of applications that  combine these abilities with many other components, not necessarily in AI, from driverless c ars to chatbots.   Many products we have today were envisaged decades ago but  have only come into place very recently. For  instance, virtual digital assistants, such as Alexa, Siri and Google Home, are still far from some of the imagined  possibilities, but they are already successfully answering a wide gamut of requests from customers, and have already become common shoulders to lean on in daily life. Similarly, computers that recognise us have been in  our imagination and desiderata for decades, but it is only recently that AI -based face recognition and biometric  systems populate smartphones, security cameras and other surveillance equipment for security and safety  purposes. Machine learning and other AI techniques are now ubiquitous; recommender systems are used to  enhance customers’ experience in retailing and streaming services, fault detection and diagnosis systems are  used in industry and healthcare, and planners and optimisers are used in logistics and transportation. Other  applications, however, have be en announced as imminent, but their deployment in the real world is taking  longer than originally expected. For instance, self -driving cars are still taking off very timidly and in very  particular contexts 3.    The key question is not if AI is envisaged or working in restricted situations, but whether an AI technology is  sufficiently developed to be applicable in the real world, as a viable product leading to public and business  value and real transformation. Only if we are able to answer this question ca n we really understand the impact  of AI research breakthroughs and the time from different stages of their development to viable products.  Policy -makers, researchers and customers need a clear technical analysis of AI capacities not only to determine  what is in -scope and out -of-scope of AI (Martínez -Plumed 2018b), but also what are the current level of  maturity and readiness of newly introduced technologies.     1.1 Objectives and contributions   The aim of this paper is thus to define the maturity of an illustrati ve set of AI technologies through the use of  Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessment. We first interpret the nine TRLs (introduced by NASA and  adapted by the EU) in the context of AI, and then we apply them systematically to different categories in AI,  by    2 https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how -much -data -do-we-create -every -day-the-mind- blowing -stats- everyone -should- read/#277a44c060ba   3 https://www.vox.com/future -perfect/2020/2/14/21063487/self -driving -cars-autonomous -vehicles -waymo -cruise -uber 
  9   choosing one or two ex amples in each category. In order to do this,  we introduce new bidimensional plots,  known as readiness -vs-generality charts, as a trade -off between how general  a technology is versus its  readiness level. We see that, in many domai ns, actual systems proven in operational environments are already  out there, but still showing limited capabilities. For more generality in capabilities, the TRL is still at an earlier  stage. We include numerous examples of AI technologies in a variety of fields and  show their readiness -vsgenerality charts. These are used as exempl ars that work as practical guidelines for anyone interested in  analysing other AI technologies using a similar methodology. The examples selected in this paper are also  sufficien tly representative for a discussion about the future of AI as a transformative technology and how these  charts can be used for short -term and mid -term forecasting. We start this open discussion at the end of this  paper.     1.2 Scope   We potentially consider all AI technologies, as defined by the areas that are usually associated with the  discipline and that is one of the main reasons why we enumerate a list of AI categories that correspond to  subfields in AI. In this regard we follow the AI Watch operational defin ition  (Samoili et al., 2020) which  defines  a concise taxonomy that characterise the core domains of the AI research field ( as well as transversal topics).  This categorisation , which proceeds from the absence of a mutually agreed definition and taxonomy of AI,  is  used as a basis for the AI Watch monitoring activity and has been established by means of a flexible scientific  methodology that allows regular revision. We do not use other characterisations of AI as comprising systems  that act rational ly or act like a human, which may be more restrictive. About the ingredients that make an AI  technology inherently ready, we cover techniques and knowledge, but also ‘compute’, data and other  dimensions of AI solutions. However, other factors affecting pac e and adoption of a technology (e.g, financial  costs of deploying solutions, labour market dynamics, economic benefits, regulatory delays, social acceptance,  etc.) fall outside the scope of this report.     1.3 Intended Audience   This document is addressed to, on one side, researchers and companies writing project proposals and trying to  determine which TRLs they will be able to achieve, and, on the other side, to policy- makers and evaluators  assessing how far a given proposal reaches in the TRL scale. For target readers not familiar with TRLs, this document is self- contained and can also serve as an introduction to TRLs and a way of analysing progress in AI  in terms of TRLs. This approach may represent a more fine -grained  (in terms of AI area -specific and , more  specifically , example- specific  readiness analysis ) and systematic scale (in terms of data collection,  implementation  and analysis ) than using performance in benchmarks, bibliometric analysis or simply  popularity.      The rest of the paper is organised as foll ows. Section 2 reviews the notion of technology readiness level,  borrowed from NASA and adapted in the EU. Section 3 presents the key methodology: we first give the  contours of what an AI technology is in particular, which is determined more precisely by t hose that can be  assigned to one (or more) of the seven AI categories corresponding to subareas in the discipline. This section introduces the readiness -vs-generality charts, which are key for understanding the state of different  technologies, by turning t he conundrum between readiness and generality into a trade -off chart. Section 4  includes one or two examples of AI technologies for each of the seven categories, with a short definition,  historical perspective and the grades of generality that are used in the charts. Section 5 discusses all charts together, finding different dynamics, and considers a prototypical example of AI technology, virtual assistant,  covering several categories. Section 6 closes the paper with an analysis of future trends in AI accor ding to the  evolution of TRL for different levels  of generality. An appendix follows after the references, including a rubric  for the TRLs.     
  10   2 Technology Readiness Levels   Defined and used on -and-off for NASA space technology planning for many years, the Technology Readiness  Levels (TRL) constitute  a systematic measurement approach  that supports consistent assessments,  comparisons, and delimitations about the maturity of one  or more technologies. TRL analysis was originally  used for aeronautical and space projects and later generalised to any kind of project, covering the whole span  from original idea to commercial deployment. The key point behind TRLs is that if we consider a specific  technology and we have information about the TRL in which it is, we can get an idea of how mature it is.  Therefore, the primary purpose of using TRLs is to help decision making concerning the development and  transitioning of technology. TRL asse ssment should be viewed as one of several tools that are needed to  manage the progress of research and development activity within an organisation.   The European Commission (EC) slightly adapted the TRL descriptions to be used in the Horizon 2020 Work  Prog rammes and calls for proposals4. The current TRL scale used by the EC consists of 9 levels. Each level  characterises the maturity of the development of a technology, from the mere idea (level 1) to its full deployment on the market (level 9) 5.   In what follows, we present these nine levels as we use them in this work (see the rubric for further details in  the Appendix, and Table 1 for a summary):     — TRL 1: Basic principles observed  (Have basic principles been observed and reported?) Lowest level of  technology readiness. Research begins to be translated into applied research and development. Examples  might include paper studies of a technology's basic properties.   — TRL 2: Technology concept formulated  (Has a concept or application been formulated?) Invention begins.  Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented. Applications are speculative and  there may be no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumptions. Examples are limited to analytic  studies.   — TRL 3: Experimental proof of concept (Has analytical and experimental proof -of-concept been  demonstrated?) Continued research and development efforts. This includes analytical studies and laboratory studies to physically validate analytical predictions of separate elements of  the technology.  Examples include components that are not yet integrated or representative.    — TRL 4: Technology validated in the lab (Has a component or layout been demonstrated in a laboratory  (controlled) environment?) Basic technological components are i ntegrated to establish that they will work  together. This is relatively "low fidelity" compared to the eventual system. Examples include integration of "ad hoc" software or hardware in the laboratory.   — TRL 5: Technology validated in a relevant environment 6 (Has a component or layout unit been  demonstrated in a relevant — typical; not necessarily stressing—  environment?) Reliability is significantly  increased. The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting  elements s o it can be tested in a simulated environment. Examples include "high fidelity" laboratory  integration of components.   — TRL 6: Technology demonstrated in a relevant environment (Has a prototype been demonstrated in a  relevant environment, on the target or su rrogate platform?) Representative model or prototype system,  which is well beyond that of TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment. This represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness. Examples include testing a prototype in a high -fidelity  laboratory  environment or in a simulated operational environment.     4 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016 -2017/annexes/h2020- wp1617- annex- ga_en.pdf   5 Note that TRLs start from applied research, not covering the fundamental research that may lay t he foundations of future technologies. The latter may be considered as a  “TRL 0” (fundamental research), although this zero level is not contemplated in the original TRL scale, and we will not use it. The lowest level used in this paper will always  be TRL 1.  6 When, in the descriptions, we talk about “relevant environment” we refer to an environment with conditions that are close eno ugh to or simulate the conditions that  exist in a real environment (production). 
  11   — TRL 7: System prototype demonstration in operational environment (Has the prototype unit been  demonstrated in the operational environment?) Represents a major step up from TRL 6, req uiring  demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment. Examples include testing the prototype in operational testing platforms ( e.g., a real -world clinical setting, a vehicle, etc.) .   — TRL 8: System complete and qualified (Has a system or development unit been qualified but tools and  platforms not operationally demonstrated?) Technology proved to work in its final form and under  expected conditions. In most cases, this TRL represents the end of true system development. Examples  include developmental test and evaluation of the system to determine if the requirements and  specifications are fulfilled. By “qualified” we also understand that the system has been certified by  regulators to be deployed in an operational environment (ready to be commercialised).   — TRL 9: Actual system proven in operational environment (Has a system or development unit been demonstrated on an operational environment?) Actual application of the technology in its final form and  under mission conditions, such as t hose encountered in operational test and evaluation. Examples include  using the system under operational conditions. This is not a necessary end point, as the technology can be  improved over the months or years, especially as more and more users can give feedback. But it may also  happen that general use unveils some flaws or safety issues, and the system must be retired, with one or  more TRLs being reconsidered for the technology.     We may group the above nine TRLs in terms of the environment in which the pr oject is developed. In the first  four levels (TRL 1 - 4) the technology validation environment is in the laboratory, in levels TRL 5 and 6 the  technology is being validated in an environment with characteristics similar to the real environment and the last three levels (TRL 7 - TRL 9) deal with the testing and validation of the technology in a real environment 7. It  can be seen graphically in Table 2 below  (column “Environment”).   Given the type of research, technological development and innovation being addressed, it should be noted that the first four  levels would address the most basic technological research involving, mostly, laboratory results.  Technological development would then be carried out from the levels TRL 5 - TRL 6 until the first prototype or  demonstrator is obtained. Technological innovation projects would be between TRL 7 to TRL 9 since technological innovation requires the introduction of a new product or service on the market and for this it  must have passed the tests and certifications as well as all relevant approvals. T hese levels  would involve  deployment or large -scale implementation. These  concepts are shown in the column “Goal” of Table 1.   If we want to assess the life cycle of the technology to be developed in terms of outputs produced 8, TRL 1 to  TRL 3 go from a first novel idea to the proof of concept. Subsequently, the technological development would be addressed (TRL 4 -  TRL 7) until it s validation. Finally, we would have its placing on the market and deployment  (TRL 8 - TRL 9). This is shown in Table 2 below , column “Product/Evaluation”.   Finally , one should also consider the results that each of the maturity levels would bring.  Table 2 below  shows  this in the column “Outputs”.   Last but not least, although TRLs have several advantages such as providing a unified and common framework  for the understanding of the status of a technology , as well as helping to make decisions concerning techn ology  funding and transition, there are some limitations. Readiness does not necessarily fit appropriateness or  feasibility: a mature technology (e.g., an automated or self -driving train) may possess a greater or lesser degree  of readiness to be used in a particular context (e.g., underground 9, airports10, etc.), but the technology may not  be ready to be applied to other contexts (e.g., general railways). We will deal with this issue later under the  concept of generality.   Some disciplines have introduced variants or specific TRL scales, e.g., changing gra nularity (Charalambous et al.  2017), while others have given extra criteria for the particular discipline but keeping the original 9- level scale  (Bucner et a. 2019). We will stick to the original scale here, and instead of giving a prescriptive refinement of    7 https://www.solarsteam.ca/TRL -file  8 https://www.cloudwatchhub.eu/exploitation/readiness -market -more -completing -software -development   9 https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/europes -longest -driverless -subway -barcelona -goes -operation  10 http://www.mediacentre.gatwickairport.com/press -releases/2018/18_03_16_autonomous_vehicles.aspx

  13   3 Methodology   As the purpose of this paper is to determine a way to evaluate the TRLs of different AI technologies, it is key to  be sufficiently general so that we could potentially consider and review any relevant and significant AI -related  developments, covering both industry and academia. In this regard, we should first define what we mean by an  AI technology, and whether this can capture new inventions and developments from all players related to  innovation and production. Note that AI is not a single technology, but  a research discipline in which different  subareas have produced and will produce a number of different technologies. Of course, we could just  enumerate a list of technologies belonging or involving AI, but it may well be imbalanced and nonrepresentative of the full range of areas in AI. Therefore, in order to be able to cover a good representation of  AI technologies that have spun off from academic or industrial research, we will identify subfields and  recognise the relevant technologies they comprise.   It is also very important to recognise that apart from readiness levels, AI is a field that develops cognitive  capabilities at different generality levels  (e.g., voice recognition for different degrees of versatility and  robustness can have  different TRLs).  Consequently, we need to assign readiness levels according to different  levels  of generality: a technology that is specialised for a very particular, controlled, domain may reach higher  TRL than a technology that has to be more general -purpose (performing  in a wide range of different  scenarios   and/or different tasks ) or even  open -ended  (performing in uncontrolled scenarios) . In order to represent the  twin importance of these two concepts , in the last subsection we introduce the readiness -vs-generality char ts,  which will be applied over a subset of relevant AI technologies in the following sections.   3.1 What is an AI technology?   In any engineering or technological field, a particular technology is defined as the sum of techniques, skills,  methods,  and processes used in the resolution of concrete problems  (Crabb 1823) . Therefore, technology as  such  constitutes an umbrella term involving any sort of (scientific) knowledge that makes it possible to design  and create goods or services that facilitate adaptation to th e environment, as well as the satisfaction of  individual essential needs and human aspirations. The simplest form of technology is the development and use  of basic tools, either in the form of knowledge about techniques, processes, etc., or embedded into  technological  systems.   Artificial intelligence (or more precisely the technology that emerges from AI) is usually defined as a “replacing  technology”, or more generally as an “enabling technology” (Gadepally et al. 2019). Enabling technologies lead  to impo rtant leaps in the capabilities of people or  society overall. For instance,  writing or the  computer  are  such enabling technologies, as they replace or enhance human memory, information transmission or  calculation. Definitely, AI introduces new capabilities, which can replace or augment human capabilities. It is  important not to confound an AI system wit h the product of AI itself. For instance, if a generative model  creates a painting, a poem or the plan of a house, the product the AI technology creates is not the painting, the poem or the plan of the house, but the generator, an AI system, which incarnat es the autonomous ability. On  the other hand, a tool such as a machine learning library is not an AI product, but a tool that allows  people to  create AI products; in this case, systems learning from data represent the autonomous ability.   The technologies t hat emerge from AI are also catalogued as “general -purpose” (Brynjolfsson et al. 2017)  defined as those that can radically change society or the economy, such as electricity or automobiles. This  definition, however, is not necessarily associated with how many different uses a technology has 11, so we  prefer the alternative term “transformative technology”. Consequently, we see AI technologies as  transformative (Gruetzemacher & Whittlestone 2019). Clearly, a technology cannot be transformative if it does  not reach critical elements of society or become mainstream. This is not possible if the technology does not  reach TRL 9. As a result, many promising technologies in AI will only become transformative when they reach  this TRL 9, and this is one reason why i t is so important to assess how far we are from this final level to really  determine the expected impact of AI on society.   All this is very well, but we still need a definition of AI technology. Although there are many different views on this, the overall research goal of AI is usually associated with the creation of technology that allows computers  to function in an intelligent manner. However, assessing “intelligent behaviour” is still a matter of controversy and active research (Hernández -Orallo 2017). T herefore, we simply assume that an  AI technology is any sort of    11 Actually, whethe r an AI technology is general- purpose or not will be considered by the term “generality” below. Some AI technologies are actually very specific.  
  14   scientific  or industrial  knowledge derived from the research and development in any subareas of the field. Of  course, this depends on how well the contours of AI are delimited (Martínez -Plumed  2018b). Therefore, in this  document, when we talk about an AI technology, we may indistinctly refer to a particular method used or  introduced in an AI subdiscipline (e.g., autoencoder), a distinctive application area (e.g., machine translation), a  specifi c product (e.g., optical character recognition system), a software tool or platform (e.g., decision support  system), etc.   3.2 Categories of AI technologies   AI is not one big, specific technology. Rather, it consists of several main areas of research and development  that have produced a variety of technologies. In other areas, the identification of technologies is performed  through different methods, depending on the goal of the technology: craft or industrial production of goods,  provision of services, or ganisation or performance of tasks, etc. However, the common phases in the invention  and development of a new technology start with the identification of the practical problem to be solved. In the case of artificial intelligence, we can assimilate this fir st stage of the identification of technology with a given  cognitive capability that we want to reproduce or create mechanically. These capabilities are usually grouped into areas of AI. Therefore, before starting to analyse the maturity levels of these dif ferent AI technologies, we  will introduce those main fields of research in AI and what sort of relevant technologies they comprise. This  categorisation is inspired by the operational definition of AI adopted in the context of AI Watch (Samo ili et al.,  2020), which proposes a concise taxonomy that characterises the core domains of AI research, as well as some  transversal areas. In our case we focus on a list of seven categories, leaving out those more philosophical or  ethical research areas related to AI. Th e categories selected are defined as follows:     — Knowledge Representation and Reasoning : This subarea of AI focuses on designing computer  representations (e.g., data structures, semantic models, heuristics, etc.) with the fundamental objective to  represent k nowledge that facilitates inference (formal reasoning) to solve complex problems. Knowledge  representation is being used, for instance, to embed the expertise and knowledge from humans in  combination with a corpus of information to automate decision proces ses. Some specific examples are IBM  Watson Health (Ahmed et al., 2017), DXplain (Hoffer et al., 2005) and CaDet (Fuchs et al., 1999).   — Learning : A fundamental concept of AI research since its inception is the study of computer algorithms that  improve automa tically through experience (Langley, 1996). While the term “learning” refers to more  abstract, and generally complex, concepts in humans (such as episodic learning), today we tend to  associate learning by computers with the prominent area of machine learni ng, in a more statistical or  numeric fashion, such as implemented in neural networks or probabilistic methods (techniques that are  now used in many of the other subdisciplines below). Machine learning involves a myriad of approaches,  tools, techniques, and  algorithms used to process, analyse and learn from data in order to create  predictive models, identify descriptive patterns and ultimately extract insights (Flach 2012, Alpaydin 2020).  These general algorithms can be adapted to specific problem domains, s uch as recommender systems (in  retail or entertainment platforms), understanding human behaviour (e.g., predicting churn) or classify images or documents (e.g., filtering spam).   — Communication : Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the AI subfield concerned with the research of  efficient mechanisms for communication between humans and machines through natural language (Clark  et al. 2013, Goldberg 2017). It is mainly focused on reading comprehension and understanding of human  language in oral conversations and  written text. There is considerable commercial interest in the field:  some applications of NLP include information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question  answering and language generation. Today, NLP, for instance, can be used in adv ertising and market  intelligence to monitor social media, analyse customer reviews or process market -related news in real time  to look for changes in customers’ sentiment toward products and manufacturers.   — Perception: Machine perception is the capability o f a computer system to interpret data from sensors to  relate to and perceive the world around them. Sensors can be similar to the way humans perceive the  world, leading to video, audio, touch, smell, movement, temperature or other kind of data humans can  perceive, but machine perception can also include many other kinds of sophisticated sensors, from radars  to chemical spectrograms, to massively distributed simple sensors coming from the Internet of Things  (IoT). Computer vision  (Szeliski 2010) has received  most attention in the past decades and deals with  computers gaining understanding from digital images or, more recently, videos. Many applications are 
  15   already in use today such as facial identification and recognition, scene reconstruction, event detectio n or  video tracking. Computer audition  (Gold et al. 2011) deals with the understanding of audio in terms of  representation, transduction, grouping, use of musical knowledge and general sound semantics for the  purpose of performing intelligent operations on audio and music signals by the computer. Applications  include music genre recognition, music transcription, sound event detection, auditory scene analysis,  music description and generation, emotion in audio, etc. Speech processing is covered by both perce ption  and communication, as it requires NLP. Finally, tactile perception, dexterity, artificial olfaction, and other  more physical perception problems are usually integrated into robotics (see below), but are needed in a wide range of haptic devices too an d many other applications.   — Planning  and search : This AI subject  related to decision theory (Steele et. al., 2016) is concerned with the  realisation of strategies or action sequences aiming at producing plans or optimising solutions for the  execution by int elligent agents, autonomous robots, unmanned vehicles, control systems, etc. Note that a  planning problem can be reduced to a search problem  (Russell  & Norvig , 2002). However,  the actions to be  planned or the solutions to be optimised are usually more complex than the outputs obtained in  classification or regression problems , due to the multidimensional and structured space of solutions (e.g., a  Markov Decision Process). In ter ms of applications, although planning has had real -world impact in  applications from logistics (Kautz et al., 2000) to chemical synthesis (Segler et al. 2018) or health (Spyropoulos, 2000), planning algorithms have achieved remarkable popularity recently i n games such as  checkers, chess, Go and poker (Silver et al., 2016, 2017; Brown et al., 2019), usually in combination with  reinforcement learning.   — Physical interaction (robotics) : This area deals with the development of autonomous mechanical devices  that can perform tasks and interact with the physical world, possibly helping and assisting humans.  Although robotics as such is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science (including remote controlled robots with no autonomy or cognitive behaviour), AI typically focuses on robots (Murphy 2019)  with a set of particular operations and capabilities: (1) autonomous locomotion and navigation, indoor or  outdoor; (2) interaction, working effectively in homes or industrial environments, perceiving humans, planning their motion, communicating and being instructed to perform their physical procedures; and (3)  control and autonomy, including the ability for a robot to take care of itself, exteroception, physical task  performance, safety, etc. As examples of well -known applications of robots with AI we find driverless cars,  robotic pets or robotic vacuum cleaners.   — Social abilities ( collective intelligence) : The broad category covering social abilities and collective  intelligence has to do with Multi -Agent Systems  (MAS), Agent -Based Modelling (AB M), Swarm Intelligence   as well as other related topics such as G ame Theor y (in  auctions , networks, economics, fairness  equilibria ,  etc.). , where collective behaviours emerge from the interaction, cooperation and coordinatio n of  decentralised self- organised agents (Shoham et al., 2008).  In general terms, here we include those  technologies that solve problems by distributing them to autonomous “agents” that interact with each  other and reach conclusions or a (semi -)equilibrium  through interaction and communication. This area  overlaps with learning, reasoning, and planning. For instance, recommender engines are well -known  applications where group intelligence emerges from collaboration (Chowdhury et al., 2010).     The above  catego risation is sufficiently comprehensive of the areas of AI (and the capabilities that are being  developed in the subject ) to have a balanced first -level hierarchy where we can assign specific technologies to.  Of course, there will be some technologies that may belong to two or more categories (we will include an  example in the discussion), but we do not expect to have technologies that cannot be assigned to any category.   Finally , note that A I technologies may be also categorise d in the form of applications o r program mes developed  to perform specific tasks  (weak AI) . Actually, AI has been used to develop and advance numerous fields and  industries  and, therefore, we can find a wide range of examples of AI  applications in areas such as healthcare   (e.g., medical diagnosis ), marketing (e.g., online assistants), automotive and transportation (e.g., self -parking  and cruise controls ), finance (e.g., electronic trading platforms ), media  (e.g., deep fakes ), military ( e.g.,  unmanned combat aerial vehicles ), educa tion ( e.g., digital assistants/tutors ), and more.  These are all high profile examples whi ch, underneath, are using different precise AI techniques  (belonging to the above list of  seven categories) to successfully perform their tasks. In this sense,  whatever the categorisation we use for AI  technologies, any subsequent TRL analys es would draw similar conclusions  as we are following an example based approach for TRL evaluation choosing one or two examples in each of the considered categor ies. 
  16     3.3 TRL ass essment in AI: readiness -vs-generality charts   In order to assess the readiness levels of AI technologies, we also face an important dilemma between the  readiness level and the ability  to act and successfully perform in real-world , open -ended (uncontrolled)   scenarios. If we describe a generic technology (e.g., a robotic cleaner), we will have a very different assessment  of readiness depending on whether the specification of the AI system requires more or less capabilities12. For  instance, if the robotic clea ner is expected to clean objects, by removing them and placing them back, and also  to cover vertical and horizontal surfaces, when people and pets are around, then the readiness level is expected to be lower than a vacuum cleaner roaming around on the floo r, with a particularly engineered  design that avoids some of the problems of a more open -ended situation. Of course, one can specify all these  technologies separately, and identify different clusters of functionalities , as we see below in Figure 1 (left).  These technolog ies are mostly independent and can reach different TRLs (shown in different darkness levels).  Progress would be analysed by seeing for how many of them the TRLs increase. However, the overlaps are not  systematic and high TRLs could be obtained by covering the whole space with very specific solutions.                 Figure 1 . Left: we can consider different instances of the technology covering different niches, each of them solving a set of  tasks, situations and conditions that are not hierarchically related to each other. Each cluster of functionality achieves a  different TRL (shown with different darkness levels) that is mostly independent of the other niches. Right: we choose a  decomposition of the space such that each instance of the technology that we analyse is a superset of the previous  instances. We call these instances “ levels  of generality”, as they are broader than the previous ones, containing them.      A different way of organising this space is a hierarchical generality model of technology , as illustrate d in Figure  1 (right). In many areas, as we will see in the following sections, there is some meaningful way (many times  more than one) to arrange the space of tasks, situations,  and conditions in a hierarchical way. I f we are a ble to  select one hierarchy that is a total order  (i.e., each  pair of instances  are comparable ), then  any instance is a  subset of a more general instance and, thus, we will be able to talk about different levels  of generality of the  same technology. This e nsures that no smaller task or situation is left out.  Also, t he idea of levels  is a good  representation of the fact that, very often, progress is cumulative.   Note that the higher generality is , the lower the expected readiness level becomes  and vice  versa.  This will help  understand the common situation where a technology is stuck at TRL 7, but reducing the scope of the  technology , i.e., less general, or focusing on a specific functionality can  lead to a product with TRL 9. Robotic  vacuum cleaners are a good example of this. By limiting the scope of the technology, whether it be the task   (only floor vacuuming) or  the range (simple trajectories), the system is more specialised (o r narrow),  with the  successful outcome that these devices are found in many homes today (TRL 9).     12 Note that we should not confuse capability  (or functionality) with sophistication (or complexity): using a more sophisticated system  does  not guarantee further  capabilities.     
  17   Another advantage of the hierarchical generality model of technology is that the total order allows the levels  to  be considered as an ordinal magnitude that c an be represented in a Cartesian space along with another ordinal  magnitude, the TRL . Thus , we can  use two -dimensional plots13 (readiness -vs-generality charts) with the degree  of generality anticipated  on the x -axis and the readiness level (the TRLs) on th e y-axis. Figure 2 illustrat es this  idea with an example.     Figure 2 . Readiness -vs-generality charts showing the different levels of capabilities (more specific to more general) on the x axis and TRL s on the y -axis. Typically, the points will form a “curve” with a descending curve. Progress towards really  transformative AI will be achieved by moving this curve to the top right .    As we move right on  this plot, we have a system or application  (i.e., an AI technology ) that is more generally  applicable. As we go up the  plot, product  readiness increas es, in term of being used  in the real world. Such  a  plot can be applied to any technology (e.g., a pencil is both general and ready, as a writing device), but  determining the balance between generality and readiness  is key in artificial intelligence, since many  technologies sacrifice generality for performance in a particular niche of applicat ion to reach some narrow  readiness. Only reaching the top right corner will generate really transformative technology14. For instance, a  robotic vacuum cleaner moving around our floors has reached TRL 9 but  has not transformed society. A fullyfledged robo tic cleaner would do  so, affecting millions of jobs and the way homes are organised for cleaning,  recycling and even decoration.  The shape of these charts may reveal some important information. A steep decreasing curve that reaches high  TRL levels for onl y low capabilities may show that important fundamental research is required to create — probably new — AI technologies that reach higher levels of generality . A flat curve that reaches only medium  TRL for a wide array  of capabilities may mean that reaching a  commercial product or general use may depend  on issues related to safety, usability or  societal  expectations about the technology, and not so  much about  rethinking the foundations of the technology. Nevertheless, a case- by-case analysis may lead to differ ent  interpretations. The next section presents the respective readiness -vs-generality chart for an illustrative set of  AI technologies.   Before presenting the case -by-case analysis,  we need to fix some criteria to determine the x -axis and the  precise locat ion of each point on  the chart. Unfortunately, there is no standard scale for levels of generality  that could be used for all technologies. For each technology, levels of generality are established by looking at the historical evolution of the technology, which means  that some l evels  (e.g. word recognition for reduced  vocabularies) did not get traction, while others (e.g., speech recognition for reduced vocabularies) can be    13 Both magnitudes (generality and TRL) are ordinal rather than quantitative, so technically a grid would be a more accurate representation than a Cartesian plot. Also, we  connec t the points with segments, but this does not mean that the intermediate points in these segments are really meaningful.   14 Here we refer to  the concept of Radically Transformative AI (RTAI) from (Gruetzemacher et al., 2019)  which is referred to  as “AI capabilities  or products which lead to  societal change comparable  to that precipitated by the agricultural or industrial revolutions ”. We may find examples of RTAI  in the literature such as high- level machine  intelligence (Grace et al. , 2018), comprehensiv e AI services (Drexler , 2019) or a broadly capable system  (Gruetzemacher, 2019).  
  18   identified as an early milestone in this technology. In all technologies,  we can identify different dimensions that  can help us define the l evels . For instance, two dimensions  are commonly involved in the definition of the  levels of generality: how many situations the technology can cover (environments, kinds of problems), which  can be as sociated with task generality, and the diversity of conditions for these situations (e.g., quality of the  information, noise, etc.), which can be associated with robustness. The first dimension (i.e. situation covered)  can unfold into two or more parameter s (e.g. for speech recognition: size of vocabulary and number of  languages) . In our hierarchical generality model of technology , we merge all of them into one single ordinal  level . There are of course cases where more challenging versions of the technology  cannot easily be reduced to  such a  unidimensional scale, but we can  still try to find a scale of levels  that go from lower to higher generality.  In a few cases, we will simply reuse some pre -established standard level s (usually defined at a development  level rather than at a  capability  level ) that have been used in the past for  that particular technology, or even  used as standards, as happens with machine translation ( see the four basic types of translation  (Hutchins et al.  1992) ) and self -driving cars  (see the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) definition  of six  levels of car autonomy70).   Once the space is defined by the generality levels  and the nine readiness levels, we locate the points in the  following way. First, we follow the rubric in the appendix. Second, for each level , we identify the highest TR L  according to the best player (research team or company) as per 2020. The reasoning behind this choice — e.g.,  instead of choosing an average — is due to the fact that on AI technologies being digital, which means that they  are quickly imitated by other pla yers. Indeed, the possible slowing factors such as patents are usually  compensated by open publication platforms such as arXiv15 and open software platforms such as github16, not  to mention the common mobility  of key people in AI between academia, in dustry and especially key tech  giants, bringing the technology with them, and spreading it to other players.   Finally, even using this generality -vs-readiness space and the rubric in the appendix, there will be cases where  we struggle to assess the TRL prec isely. This can be caused by partial information about the technology, a  definition of the TRLs that is not crisp enough, or the literature -based  definitions for the levels  of generality. It  may also be the result of the authors of this report not being  experts in each and every subarea in AI (although  some detachment may also be positive). In other cases, this is caused because our assessments have been  overseen by several experts (see the list in the acknowledgements at the beginning of the document) and  occasionally there were some minor discrepancies. For all these cases we will use vertical error bars. We hope  that some of our assessments could be replicated by other groups of experts and  build these bars as proper  confidence bands from the variance of results from a wider population of experts.   3.4 Methodology summary  The methodology developed in this report to define the maturity of AI technologies through the use of  Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessment covers the identification of AI technologies through to the assessment of their maturity levels:   1. Identification o f relevant AI technologies . Based on the categorisation of AI technologies in section  3.2, we have  assign ed specific (illustrative) technologies t o each AI area. The selection of technologies  is based on our own experience and knowledge about their relevance and “general use”. Furthermore, for some specific cases, we have also considered the associated levels of research activity (e.g.,  number  of related papers, results, benchmarks , challenges, tasks, etc.) behind a particular technology.  For the latter we have used the information provided in the AIcollaboratory  (Martínez -Plumed et al.  2020a, 2020b, 2020c) .   2. Analysis of the TRLs for AI technologies.  We introduce and use  two-dimensional plots called  readiness -vs-generality charts in which we define the degree of generality of specific AI technologies  on the x -axis vs the readiness level (the TRLs) on the y -axis.  For each technology we define the  different levels  of capabilities based on a  comprehensive analysis of the related scientific and  industrial literature .  3. Expert panel evaluation . Our initial assessment undergoes a  thorough assessment by an independent  panel of specialists, recognised in at least one of the technologies (or areas)  addressed. The experts  are asked to follow the rubric i n Appendix A to estimate the particular level in the scale  for specific    15 https://arxiv.org/   16 https://github.com/ 
  19   technologies.  Furthermore, experts provide further information on the technology in question, such as  signposting the most relevant research documents and publications which may help f ocus the analysis  onto the most appropriate  works, highlighting also any pertinent issues relating to the different  technologies.   4. Integration  and evaluation . Both our evaluations and the (qualitative) feedback and discrepancies  provided by the panel of ex perts are then used to derive error bars in the readiness -vs-generality  charts for each technology. The results are then summarised, and a briefing is produced subjected to  further series of reviews and revisions. Note that a wider group of experts, using more extensive  training on the TRLs and usual methods for aggregation or consensus of opinions (such as the Delphi   method (Bernice 1968) ) would bring more robustness to the TRL  estimates, including a systematic way  of deriving the error bars.   
  20   4 TRL Assessm ent for Representative AI Technologies   In this section, we select some illustrative AI technologies to explore how easy and insightful it is to determine  the TRL for each of them. We will examine the technologies under the categories presented in section 3 .2, and  we use readiness -vs-generality charts for each of these technologies.     4.1 Knowledge representation and reasoning   Reasoning has always been associated with intelligence, especially when referring to humans. It is no wonder that the first efforts in AI were focused on building systems that were able to reason autonomously, going from  some premises to conclusions, as in  logic. We select one AI technology in this category, expert systems ,  because of its historical relevance and representativeness of reasoning systems .   4.1.1 Technology: Expert Systems   Expert systems, as introduced in the 1980s, is a traditional AI technology th at humans can use to extend or  complement their expertise. Expert systems are usually good at logical reasoning and receive inputs as facts that trigger a series of chain rules to reach some conclusions (typically as facts or statements). Expert systems  are still fuelling many AI systems today, sometimes under the name “knowledge -based systems”, such as some  digital assistants or chatbots. In the early days of expert systems, the rules, i.e., the expertise encoded by the  expert system, were usually created by experts manually, but nowadays knowledge can be extracted from  document repositories or other sources such as the web or Wikipedia  (Mitchell et al., 2018; Gonçalves et al.,  2019). Modern systems can also revise their knowledge more easily than it was po ssible in the past. Such  systems can deal with vast amounts of complex data in many application domains (Wagner 2017).   Figure 3 . Readiness -vs-generality chart for expert system technology. While TRL 9 has clearly been reached for narrow  systems with static and certified knowledge (early commercial systems and many expert systems still in place today), a very  low TRL is estimated f or expert systems dealing with general, broad knowledge and common sense. Current development is  taking place at an intermediate level  of expert systems, where knowledge is still narrow, but is changing, uncertain and  updatable. Error bars are shown at thi s level  because of doubts in the autonomy of some of these systems (e.g., IBM  Watson).     Because of the evolution of expectations and capabilities of expert system technology, the x -axis of Figure 3  uses three different generality levels  of expert systems:      
  21   — Level  1 - narrow static and certified knowledge : manually codifying narrow expertise knowledge, reason  through bodies of specific knowledge, explain the reasoning, draw complex conclusions, etc.   — Level  2 - narrow dynamic and uncertain knowledge : automat ed knowledge refinement (belief revision,  reason maintenance (Reinfrank 1988), etc.), reason under uncertainty, actionable insights, etc.   — Level  3 - broad knowledge, common sense and meta -cognition : introspective and broad knowledge,  common sense, creative responses.     For the first level , early academic systems such as MYCIN (Shortliffe 2012) or CADUCEUS (Banks 1986)  progressed from research papers to prototypes in relevant environments (TRL 7) in the 1970s and 1980s.  Because of the excitement and expectatio ns of expert systems in the 1980s, some commercial systems were  used in business -world applications, reaching TRL 9. For instance, SID (Synthesis of Integral Design) was used  for CPU design (Gibson et al, 1990). The success  of former Expert Systems in TRL 9 also unveiled some  limitations (e.g., narrow domains, manual knowledge acquisition, lack of common -sense  knowledge, no  revision, etc.). Today, many knowledge -based systems, usually coding business rules in database management  systems as procedures or tri ggers, actually work as expert systems at this first level . Consequently, even if the  term expert system is in disuse today, systems with these capabilities are still operating at TRL 9, as shown in  Figure 3.    The second level  represents a new level of ex pectations raised after the limitations of the 1980s. A new  generation of expert systems was sought to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck and be robust to change and uncertainty. They have been integrating automated rather than manual knowledge acquisition, and  are deployed in a variety of industrial applications, such as health/diagnosi s (Hoffer et al., 2005) ,  control/management/monitoring (Jayaraman et al., 1996), stock markets (Dymova et al., 2012), space  (Rasmussen 1990), etc. However, many o f these systems do not meet the expectations of robustness and selfmaintenance completely, and some of the features of lev el 2 are not fully autonomous (requiring important  human maintenance). Because of this, we consider them more like market -ready resea rch being tested and  demonstrated in relevant environments, and thus covering different TRLs (from TRL 5 to TRL 9, ranging from  prototypes to commercial products). This is reflected by the error bars in the figure. This can also be applied to  a new generat ion of systems such as IBM Watson (Ahmed et al., 2017), which has already been validated and  demonstrated in specific operational environments (e.g., health). Watson, in a limited sense, could be  understood to be a powerful expert system, also combining a number of different techniques for natural  language processing, information retrieval, hypothes is generation, etc.   At the third level  of generality , we are talking about systems incorporating broad knowledge and common  sense reasoning over that knowledge,  including reasoning about what the system does not know (beyond  assigning probabilities to their conclusions, as Watson does).  While capturing and revising knowledge automatically for a wide range of domains has been illustrated in research papers and la b prototypes (Mitchell  et al., 2018), nothing resembling true common sense reasoning has been shown even at a research level 17, and  that is why we assign TRL 1 to this level  (although it is more likely  a fundamental research stage even before  this level).   The schism between levels  2 and 3 (and the lack of progress on  this schism in the past years) suggests there is  still fundamental research to be done  until AI systems exhibit more human- like common sen se reasoning, being  capable of predicting results and drawing conclusions that are similar to expert humans.   Of course, expert systems are  not the only technology in the knowledge representation and reasoning  category. Automated theorem provers, B oolean s atisfiability problem  (SAT) solvers , belief revision engines,  truth maintenance systems, etc., as well as other different types of deductive and inference engines, are  successful technologies that could also be analysed to determine their TRLs at different  generality levels .        17 Despite  the recent success of NLP systems in Winograd Schema Challenge (context -based pronoun disambiguation problems) (Levesque et al, 2012), an alternative of  the Turing Test (Turing, 1950), several criticisms question whether improved performance on these benc hmarks represents genuine progress towards common sense -enabled systems (see, e.g., Trichelair et al., 2019)  
  22       4.2 Learning   Learning is probably the most distinctive capability of systems that adapt to their environment. Systems that do  not learn are brittle and cannot cope with any situation that was not accounted for  beforehand. In the case of   AI technologies, we want to consider systems that are not the result of the capability (e.g., a static classifier  built with a machine learning technique that is no longer learning), but systems that continually improve with  experience. We choose two tech nologies in this category: recommender systems that are constantly updating  their recommendations as new data comes in, including new items, and more sophisticated apprentices by  demonstration, which learn by observing how a (human) expert performs a task.  Both are good ex amples of AI  technologies that represent learning systems .   4.2.1 Technology: Recommender Systems   A recommender system (Ricci et al., 2011) is a type of information filtering system that aims to provide a way  to quickly show users or users different types of topics or information items (e.g., movies, music, books, news,  images, web pages, etc.) that they are looking for as well as to discover new ones that may be of their  interest.  A recommendation service should help cope with the flood of  information by recommending a subset of  objects to the user by predicting the “rating” or “weight” that the user would give to them. Recommender  systems are based on the idea of similarities between items (i.e., an item is recommended based on interest of   a similar item) or users (i.e., an  item is recommended based on what a similar customer has consumed), or a  combination between them both.   Figure 4 : Readiness -vs-generality chart for recommender engines technology. TRL 9 reached for those very well -known  recommender systems based on user feedback and used in a variety of areas such as playlist generators for video and music  services or product recomm enders.  Current developments going beyond explicit feedback and using non- explicit latent  attributes have already demonstrated their value in operational environments. Lower TRLs (TRL 2 to TRL 6) are estimated  for more complete and flexible recommender sy stems being able to perform deeper personalisation  using various  dimensions of data. Finally, recommendation content generation  would be a future direction in the field, with still little or  no research nowadays.     Because of the evolution of expectations and capabilities of recommender systems technology, the x -axis of  Figure 4 uses four different generality levels  described in the following:     — Level  1 - Direct feedback -based recommendations: Personalised recommendation based on explicit  rankings/feedback ( click, buy, read, listen, watch...) over users/items and contexts.   
  23   — Level  2 - Indirect feedback -based recommendations: Recommendations beyond explicit feedback with  latent attributes representing categories that are not obvious from the data.   — Level  3 - Cont ext-aware highly personalised  recommendation: User -based and context -aware  personalised optimisation/recommendation balancing competing factors such as diversity, context,  evidence, freshness and novelty, and using direct/indirect feedback, adding value -aware  recommendations, etc.   — Level  4 - Content generation recommendation : Recommendations of what new items/content should be  created to fill missing needs and add value.     For the first level  of generality , we find those recommender systems able to find expli cit similarity in users and  items (making use of either or both collaborative filtering and content -based filtering (Ricci et al., 2011)) based  on explicit feedback. Here we find a number of commercial systems that are or have been used in business world a pplications, reaching TRL 9. For instance, we find the Pandora’s Music Genome Project (Howe 2009) or  the Stitch Fix’s fashion box18 as examples of content -based recommender systems. Also, the engines used in  Amazon, Netflix (Gomez -Uribe, 2015), YouTube (Davidson, 2010), Spotify19 or Linkedin (Wu et al., 2014) were  (at the beginning of their  development) examples of collaborative filtering -based approaches20. Finally, there  are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating as well as to   explore research articles and experts (Chen et al., 2011), collaborators (Chen et al., 2015), and financial services (Felfernig et al ., 2017).   For the second level , more effective methods are currently being developed  to look at similarity beyond explicit  feedback as well as latent attributes (e.g., by using matrix factorization (Koren et al., 2009) or deep learning  embeddings (Zhang et  al., 2019)) revealing relationships that have not yet been realised. Research behind  these more advanced and flexible approaches has increased exponentially in the past recent years 21 with  notable examples such as those from Zillow22, Netflix23  and Airbnb (Grbovic, 2018) already demonstrated with  success in operational and real -world environments (TRL 9).   Although successful, recommender systems still need to account for and balance multiple (competing) factors  such as diversity, context, popular ity/interest, evidence, freshness and novelty (Amatriain et al. 2016), to, for  instance, make sure the recommendations are not biased against certain kinds of users and thus going beyond  being simple proxies of accurate rating predictors. Furthermore, mult i-dimensional rating would  also be a step  beyond (Shalom et al.,2016) for recommender systems being able to optimise and personalise the whole user  experience (e.g. using a product, website, platform, etc.) via deep personalisation  and using various dimens ions  of data. In this regard, recommendations and optimisations should be based on the understanding of a user’s  browsing or attention behavior. All this would correspond with the third level of generality  in Figure 4, being  still a matter of research and prototyping (TRL 2 to TRL 6) with some approaches and examples found in the  literature (see e.g., Leonhardt et al. 2018, Ahmed et al. 2012, Kang et al. 2019) .  Regarding the fourth level  of generality , we are including further innovations for recommendation systems  such as recommending new items/products/services/contents that do not exist and should be created to ﬁll  missing needs aiming at increasing, for instance, the  value of the company or platform. G enerating the content  of a recommendation  is still a research matter, including proof -of-concepts validated in lab (TRL 2 to TRL 4)  with some ideas already published such as  automatic food menu generation (Bianchini et al. 2017), music    18 https://algorithms- tour.stitchfix.com/   19 https://towardsdatascience.com/how -spotify -recommends -your -new -favorite -artist- 8c1850512af0   20 Note that, currently, some of these companies use more advanced neural- based approaches (see e.g ., Covington et al, 2016)   21 E.g.,  The leading international conference on recommendation systems (RecSys) started to organize regular workshops on deep learning in 2016.   22 https://www.zillow.com/tech/embedding -similar -home -recommendation/   23 https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639  
  24   generation (Johansen 2018), simple fashion design24 (Kang et al. 2017,  Kumar and Gupta 2019) or even  artificially generated comments (Lin et al. 2019).   As a final note, and in terms of current advances, some authors (Ekstrand et al. 2011, Konstan et al. 2013, Beel  et al. 2016) have found that current research in recommender systems is stagnated because it is not providing  meaningful contributions neither in terms of more advanced capabilities, nor regarding practical applications.  The main reasons regarding the little impact of the research in the area are mainly the difficul ty to reproduce  recommender systems ’ research results, the lack of consistent and standard evaluations, the inexistence of  comprehensive experiments and the necessity of establishing best -practice guidelines for recommender systems research. Hence, practit ioners and operators of recommender systems may find little guidance in the  current research when looking for which recommendation approaches to use to address their specific tasks and  problems.     4.2.2 Technology: Apprentice by Demonstration  Recommender systems are complex systems involving different types of information. However, in some way, they do not differ much from a classification problem powered by statistical correlations and patterns. In the  case of humans, learning is usually associated with more complex phenomena, such as episodic learning, the  creation of abstract concepts and the internalisation of new procedures. Many of these areas are still at a preliminary stage in AI (as they have always been!), but some others are beginning  to show more progress in  recent years. Learning by demonstration (Schaal 1997) is one of these types of learning that is more complex  than a classical supervised or unsupervised machine learning problem, or even a generative model. Learning by  demonstrati on, and the related learning by imitation (Miller et al., 1941), is the way in which culture is  transmitted in apes, including humans. It is also very relevant in the workplace, as many tasks are just taught   by an expert illustrating a procedure to an appr entice, sometimes with little verbalised instruction involved.  More recently, with the popularity of short videos demonstrating simple tasks such as fixing a bike brake to  cooking a fried egg, learning by demonstration is becoming the preferred way of inst ruction for many people.  Consequently, progress in this area could have a significant impact on society.   Learning by demonstration is more technically defined in AI as learning a procedure or a task from traces, videos or examples of an operator (usually a human) performing the task. We limit our study here to tasks  where the actions are discrete and relatively simple, to avoid overlapping with the robotics category. For instance, a videogame with a finite number of “action keys” is an example of this techn ology, or a spreadsheet  automation  that learns a simple program me snippet to perform an operation. A full operator in a factory is  ruled out here because all the propriosensory complexity being involved. Consequently, we are referring to a technology that is usually known more specifically as programming by demonstration (Cypher 1993) or  programming by example (Lieberman 2001). However, more recently, the combination of deep learning with  reinforcement learning has developed new techniques, such as deep rei nforcement learning, that are able to  learn from the interaction with the environment. Soon, some of these techniques evolved to take advantage of  traces (Sutton et al., 1998), or recorded interactions performed by a human or an artificial expert (Silver e t al.,  2016,  Mnih et al., 2016, Harb et al., 2017).     24 https://towardsdatascience.com/the -future -of-visual- recommender -systems- four -practical -state -of-the-art-techniques -bae9f3e4c27f  
  25     Figure 5 : Readiness -vs-generality chart for learning by demonstration. We see that level  1 reaches TRL 9, especially because  of the possibilities of deep reinforcement learning using human traces. level  2 also reaches TRL 9 in some domains, such as  spreadsheet automation (although not in others, but we represent the maximum here, as we do in all other charts). Finally,  level  3 requires learning systems that can process background knowledge in any domain, which is still at a very preliminary  stage (TRL 2) with the principles and their envisaged applications.       The x-axis of Figure 5 uses three different generality levels , defined as follows:     — Level  1: Many examples, no background knowledge or common -sense  needed for a particular domain : In  this ‘simple’ case, a system can learn from a particular configuration of perceptions and actions (e.g., vi deo  games) and learn from thousands of traces of humans (or other systems) succeeding or failing at the task.  Note that this is supposed to be more efficient than learning without traces, or necessary in some  environments for which we lack a simulator, and  a database of recorded cases is required (e.g., protocols,  treatments, etc.).   — Level  2: Very few examples, background knowledge needed, working for a particular domain : When few  examples are available, learning needs to rely on background knowledge. Here, we assume that only one  domain (i.e., particular scenario or task) can be handled, by embedding sufficient background knowledge  into the system or in the domain -specific language used for the representation of the policies and  procedures.   — Level  3: Very few  examples, background knowledge needed, working for any domain : In this case we  want the system to handle virtually any domain. In order to reach this generality, we need the flexibility of changing the background knowledge from one domain to another, or a  system that has wide knowledge  about different areas, so that it can understand traces, videos, demos, etc., for different domains. For  instance, the system should be able to automate a task, e.g., in a sales office or in a newspaper editorial  office.     Given these levels , we can now assign the TRLs. For level  1 we can use as evidence the progress of deep  reinforcement learning from traces. For instance, AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016) was able to learn how to play go  but used some hints from human traces. S imilarly, many deep reinforcement learning algorithms use traces  (Mnih et al., 2016, Harb et al., 2017). Because new variants of these algorithms are open source and already  implemented 25, with more modest resources than in the original paper, this puts  us in TRL 9, at least for the    25 See, e.g., https://github.com/openai/baselines   
  26   video game case. If we want to create an agent that can learn to play different Arcade games from observation,  this can be done, and no background knowledge about the games is needed.   In level  2, the challenge comes from the limited number of examples. Humans usually need just one  representative example to get the idea of a new task. This is possible because they have contextual information  and background knowledge about the elements and basic actions that appear in the demonstrated task. This  domain knowledge can be hardcoded into the system, either as rules or in the language itself used to express  the learned procedures. We also assign a TRL 9 because of some successful systems in the domain of  spreadsheet automation. In particular, Flash Fill (Gulwani et al., 2012) is based on a particular domain specific language that enables Microsoft Excel users to illustrate a simple formula with very few examples. The same  idea has been brought to other domains, although each system re quires a particular DSL for each domain  (Polozov et al., 2015).   Finally, for level  3, we would like the same system to be able to learn tasks in different domains. This would  mean that this apprentice could be applied for traces or videos in any domain and could replicate the task  reliably. This level  is still in its inception, even if there has been research for decades (Muggleton 1992; Olsson  1995; Ferri et al., 2001; Gulwani et al. 2015). While some systems have been applied to toy problems, we do not fi nd evidence beyond having the technology concept formulated, and this is why we assign TRL 2.   Clearly, progress in this final level  would have a major impact in many daily tasks that are repetitive and would  not need programming or writing scripts or code snippets by hand. Such a system would have a transformative  effect on the labour market and the work of programmers, among other pr ofessions. Because the challenge  may depend on symbolic representations (for knowledge representation) and it has been explored for decades, we do not expect a breakthrough to high TRL 9 in the near -term future.     4.3 Communication   Computers exchange informatio n all the time, but their format is predefined and formal. However, humans  exchange information and knowledge in much more complex ways, especially through natural language. One big challenge of computers and AI has been developing tools that allow humans and machines to communicate  more smoothly in natural language, and more generally about tools that can do some tasks related to language  processing. We have chosen two AI technologies that are very significant in natural language processing:  machine transl ation  and speech recognition. These are two examples of AI technologies that represent systems  that (help) communicate.    4.3.1 Technology: Machine Translation   Machine translation (MT) is the automatic translation of texts from one language into another language by a  computer program me. While human translation is the subject of applied linguistics, machine translation is seen  as a subarea of artificial intelligence and computer linguistics. At a basic level, although originally machine  translation was based on sim ple substitutions of the atomic words of one natural language for those of  another. Through the use of linguistic corpora, more complex translations can be attempted, allowing for more  appropriate handling of differences in linguistic typology, sentence re cognition, translation of idiomatic  expressions and isolation of anomalies. This translation process can also be improved thanks to human intervention, for example, some systems allow the translator to choose proper names in advance, preventing  them from b eing translated automatically. MT services have become increasingly popular in recent years, and  there is an extensive range of MT software and special tools available, enabling fast processing of large volumes of text.    
  27     Figure 6 : Readiness -vs-generality  chart for Machine Translation (MT) technology. TRL 9 has been reached for the first two  types of MT (MAHT and HAMT). Currently, FATM approaches have reached a crucial moment, with powerful market -ready  products such as Google Translator or DeepL, and a li vely research community developing and testing new systems at the  expense of the improvements in neural -based approaches. The two FAHQT levels, either at controlled or uncontrolled  scenarios, are estimated to have very low TRW due to the current limitation s in the area of MT.      In terms of capabilities of MT, we define five levels  of machine- assisted translation (see Figure 6) following the  different types of translations already defined in the literature (Hutchins et al. 1992). While the level  of  autonomy is key in the first three of these types, and quality in levels  3 and 4, and these two factors are not  necessarily aligned with levels  of generality, we prefer to keep the original scale as the most interesting  (challenging) levels  are 4 to 5 and do correspond with varying generality:     — Level  1 - Machine -assisted human translation (MAHT):  The translation is performed by a human  translator who uses a computer as a tool to improve or speed up the translation process.   — Level  2 - Human -assisted machine translation (HAMT):  The source and/or the target language text is  modified by a huma n translator either before, during, or after it is translated by the computer.   — Level  3 - Fully automatic (automated) machine translation (FAMT) : This represents automatic production  of a low -quality translation from the source language without any human intervention.   — Level  4 - Fully automatic high -quality machine translation in restricted and controlled domains  (FAHQMTr) : This represents automatic production of a high -quality  translation from the source language  without any human intervention in restricted and controlled domains.    — Level  5 - Fully automatic high -quality machine translation in unrestricted domains (FAHQMTu) : This  represents automatic production of a high -quality  translation from the source language without any  human intervention in unrestricted domains.     For the first two levels , it is clear we already reached TRL 9 levels, with a myriad of translation products 26 as  well as dictionaries27 and, thesaurus28 in the market, helping to combine machine and human- based  translations.     26 https://www.sdl.com/ , https://www.memoq.com/  or https://www.wordfast.net/   27 https://www.wordreference.com/   
  28   In terms of current developments in FAMT (third level  of capabilities), we have a number of successful MT  software and applications, Google Translator being the flag bearer in FAMT  (TRL 9). In some instances, MT  services can replace human translators and dictionaries, and provide (imperfect but satisfactory) translations  immediately. This is the case when getting the general meaning across is sufficient, such as with social media  updates, manuals, presentations, forums, etc. In this regard, current MT software and applications29 are best  suited when we need quick, one -off translations and accuracy is not of importance. Also, MT applications are  particularly effective domains where formal (structured) language is used.  Finally, it should also be noted that  although the technology has reached a TRL 9, MT is currently a hot area in AI in which a lot of advances are being achieved using new neural -based approaches (Sutskever et al., 2 014), which have largely overcome the  classical statistical approaches.   In this setting, the fourth and fifth levels  correspond with the ultimate goal of MT: FAHQMT . As already  commented, MT produces more usable outputs than when translating conversations  or less standardised text.  However, when aiming at professional translations of complex texts, business communication, etc., MT does not constitute, currently, a genuine or satisfactory alternative to qualified specialist translators 30. A number of  scholars questioned the feasibility of achieving fully automatic machine translation of high quality in the early  decades of research in this area, first and most notably Yehoshua Bar -Hillel (Yehoshua, 1964). More recently,  some research (TRL 1 to TRL 3) is b eing carried out for restricted scenarios (see, e.g., Muegge 2006),  corresponding with the fourth level . Level  5 is still considered a utopia in MT (TRL 1) in the short or mid -terms .  The most obvious scenario is the translation of literary texts: MT system s are unable to interpret text in  context, understand the subtle nuances between synonyms, and fully handle metaphors, metonymy, humour ,  etc.  4.3.2 Technology: Speech Recognition   Speech recognition comprises those techniques and capabilities that enable a system  to identify and process  human speech. It involves sub- areas such as Speech Transcription (Seide et al. 2011) and Spoken Language  Understanding (SLU) (Tur et al. 2011), among others, but we will focus on the former. Although speech  recognition first came o n the scene in the 1950s with a voice -driven machine named Audrey (by Bell Labs),  which could understand the spoken numbers 0 to 9 with a 90 percent accuracy rate (Juang et al., 2005),  nowadays, speech recognition program mes can recognise a virtually limit less number of spoken words, aided  by cognitive and computational innovations (e.g., pure or hybrid neural models combining statistical approaches).     28 https://www.thesaurus.com/   29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_machine_translation_applications   30 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation 
  29     Figure 7 : Readiness- vs-generality chart for speech recognition technology. TRL 9 has clearly been reached  for narrow  systems with limited voice commands or conversational interface such as those shown by the widespread VAs like  Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, etc. Current research is going towards more advanced speech capabilities including vocabulary  size, spe aker independence and attribution, processing speed, etc. Low TRLs are estimated for systems showing native speaker language understanding capabilities .    Because of the evolution of expectations and capabilities of speech recognition technology, the x -axis of Figure  7 uses four different generality levels :    — Level  1 - Limited voice commands : Predefined instructions or voice commands in the recognition system  with a particular (formal) syntax using, e.g., limited speech dictionaries.   — Level  2 - Large -voca bulary continuous speech recognition systems : Restricted -domain speech recognition  systems with larger vocabularies for the spoken (formal and informal) words and phrases, some interaction  with the user, high levels of robustness and accuracy of data, endpoint detection, no speech timeout, etc.   — Level  3 - Free speech recognition in restricted contexts : Open -ended vocabulary (formal and informal),  far-field (remote) sources, speaker attribution, full transcription from any audio/video source, and able to  deal with noise, echo, accents, disorganised speech, etc.   — Level  4 - Native -level free speech recognition in unrestricted contexts : Native -speaker multi -language  recognition in adversarial environments, involving complete processing of complex language utte rances,  spontaneous speech, confusability, speaker independence, etc., under (possibly) adverse conditions.     For the first level , we find those voice recognition systems allowing predefined and limited system proprietary  voice commands to perform specific instructions. We are able to find this technology in the market (TRL 9)  since the 1980s in different products and applications, from voice -controlled operating systems (see e.g., the  “Speakable Items” (Wallia 1994) in Mac OS in the 1990s) to toys (see, e.g., the Worlds of Wonder's Julie doll31  in the 1980s) or in -car voice recognition systems (Tashev et al., 2009)   For the second level , common applications today include voice interfaces in robots, digital assistants or specific  software such as voice dict ation, voice dialling or call routing, domotic appliance control, preparation of  structured documents, speech- to-text processing, and aircraft (e.g., direct voice input allowing the pilot to  manage systems). Note that although all the above speech recognit ion-powered products and software are  market -ready products (TRL 9) with high levels of robustness and accuracy, the capabilities achieved by these    31 http://www.robotsandcomputers.com/robots/manuals/Julie.pdf   
  30   systems are still limited to restricted domains, also having problems with noise environments, different  accents, disorganised conversations, echoes, speaker distance from the microphone, etc.    Level  3 is still largely in research and evaluation phases; it is limited in that current approaches (e.g., language  models and acoustic models) cannot handle the comple xities of a free speech recognition application in  unrestricted contexts with multiple speakers for a myriad of languages and different regional accents for the  same languages. Furthermore, even in controlled contexts with a limited dictionary, there is st ill a lack of  accuracy with common misinterpretations. Therefore, we can say that the technology achieving these  capabilities is still a matter of research, prototyping and testing (TRL 3 to 7).   Finally, much more advanced capabilities in terms of a compl ete natural (multi -)language recognition in  complex and unrestricted scenarios (as adult native speakers would do for their mother tongue) is still a long term goal today for the research in the area (given the state being at TRL 1 to TRL 3). Working under  adverse  conditions (e.g., noise, different accents, complex language utterances, etc.) will be eventually solved in the short or medium term as they are problems that can be addressed with larger datasets and models. However,  more complex scenarios such a s language -independent speech recognition including the understanding of nonexplicit information such as the use of prosody, emotions, meaningful pauses, intentional accents or even “mind reading” (e.g., speaker intention modelling) are clearly more long -term goals in the field.     4.4 Perception   Perception is a capability that we find in most animals, to a greater or lesser extent. In humans, vision is usually  recognised as a predominant sense, and AI, especially in the recent years, has given this predominance  to  machine vision32. Even if we just cover vision below, we select two important technologies, facial recognition   and text recognition, with very different perception targets, representing two good examples of AI technologies  that incarnate  systems tha t perceive.   4.4.1 Technology: Facial Recognition  A facial recognition (or identification) system is a technology capable of recognising or verifying a person from a  digital image or a frame from a video source. In general, these systems work by comparing select ed facial  features from a given image (i.e., an “unknown” face) with faces within a database. An added difficulty is that  this process may be needed in real time and, possibly, in adversarial scenarios. In recent years, facial  recognition has gained a lot of attention, becoming an active research area and covering various disciplines  such as image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision and neural networks. Facial recognition could  also be considered within the field of object recognition, where th e face is a three- dimensional object subject  to variations in lighting, pose, etc., and has to be identified based on its 2D projection (except when 3D  techniques are used).   Because of the evolution of expectations and capabilities of expert system techno logy, the x -axis of Figure 8  uses three different generality levels  of expert systems:    Level  1 - Recognition under ideal situations : gender, age or identity recognition from high -quality stand still  full-frontal  faces in controlled scenarios (illuminatio n, camera and person are controlled).   Level  2 - Recognition under partially controlled situations : gender, age or identity recognition from low -quality  frontal faces (~20 degrees off) possibly in less controlled scenarios: illumination and camera are contr olled, but  not the person (e.g., railway stations or airports check- ins).   Level  3 - Recognition under uncontrolled situations : gender, age or identity recognition at pose variations, in  low-resolution and poorly illuminated from (partial) facial photos/vid eo in uncontrolled scenarios: neither the  camera, nor the illumination, nor the person is controlled, such as in open spaces where pictures may be taken  using smartphones, dashcams, etc. The recogition must be robust to person characteristics such as race,  sex,  etc., as well as changes in hairstyle, facial hair, body weight, and the effects of aging.     32 This predominance is perhaps exaggerated, at least with a view of AI as achieving intelligent behaviour.  Blind people from birth are the proof that full cognitive development is possible without sight.  
  31     Figure 8 : Readiness- vs-generality chart for facial recognition technology. TRL 9 has been clearly reached by facial  recognition systems in controlled, ideal environments, with a number of systems being used for different applications  (control, security, advertising, social media, etc.). Facial recognition systems under less controlled situations (such as in   crowded train/metro stations or airports), and regardless of the expression, facial hair or age of the people, are also  currently being tested and demonstrated in operational environments (TRL between 7 and 9). Lower TRLs are estimated  when this sort of systems perform in totally uncontrolled scenarios having to deal with, for instance, pose variations, low  quality/resolution, bad lighting, etc., and with people of various race, sex and other personal characteristics (e.g., facial  hair,  body weight, accessories, etc.).       Regarding the first  level , most current facial recognition systems excel in matching one image of an isolated  face with another in very controlled situations, such as when checking a driver’s license or a passport. In this  regard, nowadays we find lots of market -ready facial  recognition applications (TRL 9) related to security, law  enforcement or surveillance (helping police officers identify individuals33, find missing people34, etc.); retail and  advertising (e.g., enabling more targeted advertising by predicting peopl e’s age and gender35), social media  (e.g., to automatically recognise when its members appear in photos), financial services (e.g., digital payments, online account access 36, etc.), boarding controls in airports or train stations37, among others. At present  development levels, these systems are also able to detect people’s gender (see, e.g., Mansanet et al., 2016), age 38 and even emotions (see, e.g., Ko 2018) with accuracy levels of over 99%39 40. However, these systems sti ll  rely on full frontal face images with little or no change in illumination and orientation angle to achieve those high levels of predictive accuracy.   As for the second level , facial recognition outside of a controlled environment is no simple task. It i s true that  the technology is being evolved and designed to compare and predict potential matches of faces regardless of  their expression (see Samadiani et al., 2019 for a review), facial hair (see, e.g., Xie et al., 2018), and age (see    33 https://www.interpol.int/How -we-work/Forensics/Facial -Recognition   34 https://www.independent.co.uk/life -style/gadgets -and-tech/news/india -police -missing -children -facial -recognition- tech -trace -find- reunite -a8320406.html   35 https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/03/privacy -tesco -scan -customers- faces   36 https://findface.pro/en/solution/finance/   37 https://www.a irportveriscan.com/   38 https://labs.everypixel.com/api/demo   39 https://paperswithcode.com/task/face -recognition   40 https://neurosciencenews.com/man -machine -facial -recognition- 120191/   
  32   e.g., Park et al., 2010). Also, there are currently a number of initiatives testing and demonstrating their  capabilities in different operational and real -world scenarios (TRL 7 - 8) such as railway stations, airports,  stadiums, etc., with different goals (e.g., security, co ntrol, etc.)  (Galbally  et al. 2019 ). However, at this level  of  generality, the technology is having two major drawbacks: (1) performance: facial recognition is still much more effective in “constrained situations” than for more general and uncontrolled scenarios where illumination, pose/angle/position and expressi on are the three major uncontrolled parameters that makes  facial recognition a hard task; and (2) restrictions: current plans to install facial recognition systems in crowded  public places for, e.g., surveillance reasons, are suffering from criticisms from  civil society organisations as well  as bans from the authorities 41 (approval is needed for TRL 8), although there are some surveillance and security  systems currently operating (TRL 9)  in less privacy -concerned countries such as China (see, for instanc e, the  YITU Dragon Eye products used in Shanghai Metro42).  A further step in generality, corresponding with the third level  in Figure 8, involves addressing more complex  factors (in uncontrolled scenarios) such as inadequate illumination, partial or low  quality image or video (e.g.,  only one eye is visible), multiple camera angles, poses or image variations (e.g., the subject is not looking  straight into the camera), obstructions (e.g., people wearing hats, scarfs, sunglasses), etc. Furthermore, a drop  in performance is obtained for facial recognition systems when trying to recognise people of different race or  sex (Grother et al., 2019), this being a challenge for these systems. In terms of development, there are  currently some research initiatives producing new methods for partial and unconstrained face recognition,  although it is still work in progress (TRL 1 to TRL 3) and recognition accuracy can be as low as 30% -  50% in  some cases (Elmahmudi, at al., 2019).   4.4.2 Technology: Text Recognition   Text Recognit ion is the process of digitising text by automatically identifying symbols or characters from an  image belonging to a certain alphabet, making them accessible in a computer -friendly form for text processing  program mes or similar. Text recognition involves both offline recognition (e.g., input scanned from images,  documents, etc.) and online recognition (i.e., input is provided in real time from devices such as tablets,  smartphones, digitisers, etc.). Here we will focus on the former. Large amounts of written, typographical,  or  handwritten information exist and is continuously generated in all types of media. In this context, being able to  automate the conversion (or reconversion) into a symbolic format implies a significant saving in human  resources and an i ncrease in productivity, while maintaining or even improving the quality of many services.  Optical character recognition (OCR) has been in regular use since the 1990s, developed significantly with the  widespread use of the fax by the end of the 20th centur y. Today, they are already in wide use, but the  possibilities and requirements have evolved with a more digital society.   Figure 9 tries to model the evolution of expectations in terms of the different capabilities of text recognition technology through the  following levels  of generality:     — Level  1 - Template -based typewritten and handwritten character recognition:  recognition of typewritten  and handwritten character  in structured documents (e.g., postal systems, bank -check processing,  passports, invoices, e tc.).  — Level  2 - Free -form handwritten character recognition : recognition of (non -)separable/segmentable  handwritten characters with automatic layout analysis in unstructured documents.   — Level  3 - Free -form unconstrained handwritten word recognition:  recogn ition of unconstrained  (non)separable/segmentable  handwritten words  in unstructured documents.   — Level  4 - Complex non -pundit -readable text recognition : recognition, interpretation and deciphering of  non-pundit -readable media (e.g., ancient or badly dama ged) unconstrained texts in any format.     41 Some examples include: https://www.euractiv.com/section/data -protection/news/german -ministers- plan -to-expand- automatic -facial -recognition- meets- fierce criticism/ , https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/facial- recognition- ban-san-francisco.html  or https://sciencebusiness.net/news/eu -makes- move -ban- use-facial recognition- systems    42 https://www.yitutech.com/en   
  33     Figure 9 . Readiness -vs-generality chart for text recognition technology. TRL 9 has been clearly reached by OCR systems. For  free-form character recognition, current developments in machine learning and computer vis ion are improving the  performance of these systems, where we may find prototypes for testing and demonstrating new capabilities as well as  market -ready products (TRL 5 to TRL 9). More advanced capabilities in terms of unconstrained, free- form recognition o f  handwritten text is still a matter of research and development (TRL 2 to TRL 6). Very low TRLs are estimated for text  recognition systems addressing the interpretation and deciphering of non -human- readable media.     For the first level  we find the simples t (and common) form of character recognition: template -based optical  character recognition (OCR). OCR as a technology has been instrumental in automating the processing of  managing physical typewritten documents. For instance, enterprises using OCR softwar e can create digital  copies of structured documents such as invoices, receipts, bank statements and any type of accounting documents that needs to be managed. Passports, , and other forms of structured documentation that need to  be managed are also the tar get of OCR software. The accuracy of these systems is dependent on the quality of  the original document, but levels are usually around 98% or 99% for printed text (Holley 2009), which is good  enough for most applications, or 95% when addressing, for instance, very specific handwritten recognition task  such as postal address interpretation (see, e.g., (Srihari et al 1997)). Most commercial products and software  are of this type (TRL 9) 43.    Currently, OCR technology has been improved by using a combination of machine learning and computer vision algorithms to analyse document layout during pre -processing to pinpoint what information has to be extracted.  This technology is usually called “Inte lligent Character Recognition” (ICR) and targets both unconstrained  typewritten and handwritten text, imposing new challenges to the technology. This represents thus the second  level  of capabilities in Figure 9. Because this process is involved in recognis ing handwriting text, accuracy levels  may, in some circumstances, not be very good but can achieve 97 -99% accuracy rates in structured forms when  handling capital letters and numbers (Ptucha et al., 2019) which are easily separable/segmentable, but it fail s  when addressing more complex scenarios such as unconstrained texts or non- separable (e.g., cursive)  handwriting. However, these error rates do not preclude these systems from massive use, with plenty of ICR  products and software currently in the market 44 (TRL 9). It is also an active area of research (see, e.g., Bai et al.,  2014; Oyedotun et al., 2015; Yang et al.,2016; Ptucha et al., 2019;) where new alternatives (e.g., neural  approaches) are being developed and assessed.   The third level  of capabiliti es represents further advancements in this sort of technology involving recognition  of unconstrained (i.e., non- easily separable/segmentable) and free- form handwritten word (instead of    43 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_optical_character_recognition_software   44 See http://www.cvisiontech.com/library/ocr/text -ocr/intelligent -character- recognition- software.html , https://abbyy.technology/en:features:ocr:icr or  https://www.scanstore.com/Forms_Processing_Software/ICR_Software/  
  34   “character”) recognition45. “Intelligent word recognition” (IWR) technologies46 may fall into this level . IWR is  optimised for processing real -world documents that contain mostly free -form, hard -to-recognise data fields  that are inherently unsuitable for ICR. While ICR recognizes on the character -level, IWR works with  unstructured information (e.g., full words or phrases) from documents. Although IWR is said to be more  evolved than hand print ICR, it is still an emerging technology (TRL 5 to TRL 9) with some products performing  capabilities to decode (scanned) prin ted or handwritten text (see, e.g., Google Vision API47 used in Google  Docs48 and Google Lens app49), as well as number of  prototypes being tested and validated in relevant  environments (Yuan et al., 2012; Acharyya et al., 2013).   Finally, much mo re advanced uses of text recognition systems would be, for instance, to interpret ancient or  badly damaged texts that can only be deciphered by pundits or even not deciphered by humans. In this line  there we nowadays find some efforts in terms of research and projects (see, e.g., Lavrenko et al. 2004, Sánchez  at al. 2013, Granell et al. 2018, Toselli et al. 2019), but without going beyond successful validations and  demonstrations from laboratory to relevant scenarios (TRL -2 to TRL -6).     4.5 Planning   In this AI category, planning usually deals with choosing the best sequence of actions according to some utility  function, and scheduling is about arranging a set of actions (or a plan) in a timeline subject to some constraints.  Not surprisingly, this is one of the a reas in AI that had early successful applications in different domains. We   choose transport scheduling systems as a well -delineated example of an AI technology that represents systems  that plan.    4.5.1 Technology: Transport Scheduling Systems   Transport scheduling refers to those tactical decisions associated with the creation of vehicle service schedules  (also called “timetabling”) aiming at minimising the net operating costs (Boyle 2009). In order to determine an  appropriate vehicle schedule, there are also othe r factors having a direct effect on the operating costs: the  number of vehicles required, the total mileage and hours for the vehicle fleet as well as the crew schedule.  These activities are usually assisted by software systems with or without direct inter action with the planner in  charge. This sort of systems take as input several parameters, including the frequency of service in different  routes, the expected travel times, etc., as well as different operating conditions and constraints (e.g.,  “clockface” values, vehicle reutilisation/repositions, layovers, coordination of passenger transfers, number of  vehicles, etc.), to  generate high -quality solutions (e.g., departure times).   Because of the evolution of the expectations and capabilities of transport sc heduling technology, the x -axis of  Figure 10 uses three different generality levels  described as follows:     — Level  1 - Specific -purpose offline scheduling: all the information is available beforehand with no  uncertainty, which can be used as an input and an optimised schedule is output. The particularities of the  domain are embedded into the system and only the data is given as an input.   — Level  2 - Specific -purpose online scheduling/rescheduling:  all or part of the input information comes in  real time, with u ncertainty in measurements or in the information (e.g., a train that should arrive at 3:30  but arrives at 3:40). Still, the particularities of the domain are embedded into the system.     45 Note that the transcription at further levels (e.g., line or paragraph) goes beyond this technology as it  involves other technologies such as (joint) line segmentation  (Bluche 2016)   46 https://www.efilecabinet.com/what -is-iwr-intel ligent -word -recognition- how -is-it-related -to-document -management/ , https://content.infrrd.ai/case -studies/globalinvestment -firm-uses -infrrds -intelligent -data -processing   47 https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/handwriting   48 https://docs.google.com/   49 https://lens.google.com/ 
  35   — Level  3 - General -purpose online scheduling/rescheduling:  the informati on also comes in real time and  with uncertainty, but the system is now designed to be extended with new subsystems that have different  specific behaviours. For instance, a train station scheduling system can include the behaviour, utilities and  constraints  of bus and metro subsystems connecting with the station, as well as events in the city, and  optimise globally.     Figure 10 : Readiness- vs-generality chart for transport scheduling system  technology.  The range of software systems that  are able to perform offline and online scheduling for particular domains implies a TRL 9 for the first two levels. More  general -purpose scheduling systems have a lower TRL, between 3 and 7.       Although, traditionally, tran sport timetables have been manually generated (e.g., using time -distance diagrams  (Chakroborty et al., 2017) where schedules are manually adjusted to meet all the constraints), this process can  take a long time and it is unfeasible when dealing with high -loaded transport networks. At the first level  of  generality, computer -based scheduling and planner systems have appeared over the last decades to provide  automated and optimised transport scheduling for vehicles and drivers. These systems have been launched,  after years of research, for different areas of application (TRL 9) including, among others, (a) trains (Ghoseiri  et al., 2004, Ingolotti et al., 2004, Abril et al. 2006) with a huge number of commercial products such as RAILSYS 50,  OTT51 or MULTIRAIL52; (b) flights (Feo et al, 2009), also with a myriad of commercial applications such as  FLIGHTMANAGER53, OASIS54 or TAKEFLIGHT55; (c) buses and shuttles (Gavish et al., 1978), with software  platforms as GOALBUS56, TRIPSPARK57 or REVEAL58; (d) maritime transport (Meng et al., 2014) with commercial  software such as MJC259, or MES60: or (e) road transport (Törnquist 2006), with software products such as    50 https://www.rmcon -int.de/railsys -en/  51 https://www.via -con.de/en/development/opentime table/   52 https://www.oliverwyman.com/our -expertise/insights/2013/jan/multirail- pax- _-integrated- passenger -rail-planning -.html   53 https://www.topsystem.de/en/flight- scheduling -1033.html   54 http://www.osched.com/   55 https://tflite.com/airline -software/Passenger -Service -System/flight -schedule/   56 https://www.goalsystems.com/en/goalbus/   57 https://www.tripspark.com/fixed -route -software/scheduling -and- routing  58 http://reveal -solutions.net/bus -routing -scheduling -software/bus -scheduling -software -101/   59 https://www.mjc2.com/transport- logistics -management.htm    
  36   PARAGON61 or PARADOX62. Note that all these systems are specialised (or adapted) for performing  in very  particular scenarios, and there is no general -purpose tool.   For the second degree, we consider that the input information can be provided online so an automated  scheduling system needs to process it in real time. The systems should have then two parts: off -line scheduling  (for known information) and on -line re -scheduling. While the former oversees  scheduling vehicles and crews  from known information, the latter has to be applied in response to the new specific needs and/or incidents  that may appear . The schedules have to be dynamically updated balancing the resources (vehicles, timeslots,  crew, etc.) available. Examples of real -time requirements or incidents may be, for instance, to meet specific  travel demands or requests of passengers (e.g., new s tops), to adapt to perturbations or problems regarding  resources/demand (e.g., failures in vehicles), or manage new schedule intervals between new events (e.g., as  volcano eruptions or heavy weather -related issues), etc. Dealing with real -time needs also entails that  scheduling systems have to be able to confront different levels  of uncertainty in terms of measurements or in  the information they are provided (e.g., a train will arrive at 3:30 but it arrives at 3:40). Like in the first level , we  are able to find plenty of research in this regard (see, e.g., Eberlein et al., 1998; Fu et al., 2002; D’Ariano et al.,  2008, Verderame et al., 2010; Wegele et al., 2010; Reiners et al., 2012) as well as market -ready applications  (e.g., MJC263 for road traffic, TPS64 for trains, OPTIBUS65 for bus/shuttles) applied to different transport  scenarios, this implying a TRL 9 for this sort of more capable scheduling systems.   Finally, for the third level , we introduce a further level of generality in terms of these systems b eing able to be  extended to any sort of transport scheduling problem with a combination of other transportation systems and  other constraints and utility functions (e.g., a coach service combined with a train service). However, having  general -purpose scheduling software systems is more difficult due to the varietal intrinsic characteristics of  each scenario (it is not the same scheduling a fleet of trucks based on road- traffic characteristics as scheduling  flights based on airflows, hub bankings and other f light characteristics). However, although the previously  introduced products and software platforms are all domain -specific systems, the task of automating scheduling  or timetabling (as a multi -objective constrained optimisation problem) is a general probl em creating a  feasible/optimised schedule for any kind of service or a combination of them. In (Hassold et al., 2014; Liu et al.,  2016) we can see some general -purpose solutions (at the research level), but they are still being tested and  demonstrated in particular domains. That is why we give a TRL value between 3 and 7.     4.6 Physical interaction (robotics)   Many people have a paradigmatic view of intelligent systems as robots that physically interact with the world.  While a great part of AI applications are d igital, it is those tasks that require physical interaction with the world  and with humans in particular that usually shape people’s imagination about AI. When asking people about AI  systems, navigation (e.g., going from one place to another safely) is an important subgoal of many of these  systems. We have selected two very relevant and different technologies in this category, self- driving cars and  home cleaning robots . Again, when robotics is combined with AI we expect these physical systems not to be  cont rolled by humans (locally or remotely) but be given instructions (e.g., where to go and what to clean) and  follow them autonomously. The following two examples  are good examples of AI technologies that represent  systems that interact physicall y.   4.6.1 Technolog y: Self -Driving Cars   AI is changing the act of driving itself: automated technologies already assist drivers and help prevent  accidents. As vehicle automation is progressively reaching new levels, these technologies are becoming one of    60 https://cirruslogistics.com/products/marine -enterprise -suite/    61 https://www.paragonrouting.com/en- gb/our -products/routing -and-scheduling/integrated -fleets/   62 https://www.paradoxsci.com/transportation- logistics -software -rst  63 https://www.mjc2.com/transport -logistics -management.htm    64 https://www.hacon.de/en/solutions/train- capacity -planning/   65 https://www.optibus.com/  
  37   the greatest forces  transforming modern transportation systems. However, and despite extraordinary efforts  from many of the leading names in tech and in automaking, fully- autonomous66 cars are still out of reach   except in special trial program mes67, and their potential impac t with respect to timing, uptake, and penetration  remains uncertain68.     Figure 11 . Readiness- vs-generality chart for self -driving cars technology. TRL 9 has been clearly reached by many cars in our  roads in the levels between NHTSA levels 0 and 2 of auto mation. For NHTSA levels 3 and 4, current developments from  automobile companies are currently performing research, prototyping and testing with self -driving cars (so TRLs are  between 5 and 7). However, very low TRLs are still estimated for fully self -driving cars requiring no human attention at all.     While a generality scale could be developed in terms of the scenarios a fully -automated car could manage (e.g.,  from simple trips to complex situations), the discussion is usually set at identifying several levels of driving  automation based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required. In particular we use  the US  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) definition of  six levels of car autonomy to evaluate the  self- driving capab ilities of cars69. They released this guidance to both push forward and standardise  autonomous vehicle testing. The ‘NHTSA levels’ (which we use here as levels  of generality) are the following:     — Level  1 (NHTSA  Level 0) - No Automation: A Level 0 car has no self- driving capabilities at all.   — Level  2 (NHTSA Level 1) - Driver Assistance : A Level 1 vehicle can assist with either steering or braking, but  not both at the same time.   — Level  3 (NHTSA Level 2) -  Partial Automation : A Level 2 vehicle can assist with both steering and braking at  the same time.   — Level  4 (NHTSA Level 3) -  Conditional Automation : The vehicle itself controls all monitoring of the  environment (using sensors like LiDAR).   — Level  5 (NHTSA Level 4) -  High Automation : At Levels 4 and 5, the vehi cle is capable of steering, braking,  accelerating, monitoring the vehicle and roadway as well as responding to events, determining when to  change lanes, turn, and use signals.     66 We do not want completely -autonomous vehicles choosing where to go. By autonomous, we usually mean a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment  and  moving safely with little or no  human input, apart from the destination and preferences commands.  67 https://www.vox.com/future -perfect/2020/2/14/21063487/self -driving -cars-autonomous -vehicles -waymo -cruise -uber   68 https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive -and- assembly/our -insights/ten- ways -autonomous -driving -could- redefine -the-automotive -world   69 https://www.sae.or g/news/press -room/2018/12/sae -international- releases -updated -visual- chart -for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels -of-driving -automation%E2%80%9D standard -for-self-driving -vehicles  
  38   — Level  6 (NHTSA Level 5) -  Full Automation : This level of autonomous driving requires absolutely no human  attention.     For the first level  (level 0), there is no automation at all as the human does all the driving at all times.  Realistically, until recently, most vehicles were Level 0 (TRL 9). In turn, in the second level  (level 1) we find  some assistance systems for driving and maintenance such as  the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) that is in  charge of handling the braking systems to, for instance,  keep a specified distance from the car in front of you,  but it has no other control ove r the car (e.g., steering). In this regard, most, if not all, brands and automobile  groups (e.g., PSA, VAG, General Motors, Daimler, etc.) incorporate ACC to their models nowadays (TRL 9).   Moving to the third level  (level 2), the vehicle may assist with bo th steering and braking at the same time but it  still requires full driver attention, and the driver must be ready to take over at any time. Combining adaptive  cruise control (from Level 1) with lane centering (or auto steer, a mechanism that keeps a car c entered in the  lane) capabilities met the definition of Level 2. Tesla’s Auto -Pilot70 feature, as seen on the Model S, X, and 3,  currently falls into the Level 2 category (TRL 9).   As for the fourth level  (level 3), the driver’s attention is still critical but they can leave the handling of some  (critical) functions such as braking, and delegate them to the autonomous system in the vehicle when  conditions are safe. Many current Level 3 vehicles require no human attention to the road at speeds under 37  miles per hour. Audi and others have already announced Level 3 autonomous cars to launch in 2018, but it has  not actually happened due to the restrictive regulatory, technical, safety, behavioral, legal and business -related  complications (TRL 8).   At the fifth le vel (level 4), although the vehicle is capable of steering, braking, accelerating, it would first notify  the driver when there are safe conditions to take over the driving task, and only then does the driver may  decide to switch the vehicle into autonomous   mode. However, vehicles reaching this level of autonomy cannot  determine between more complex and dynamic driving scenarios (e.g., traffic jams). In terms of developments, Honda has announced it is working towards a Level 4 vehicle by 2026 71. Uber and Go ogle’s Waymo have also  announced they have been working on Level 4 vehicles, but the reality is all their cars require safety drivers and they are currently testing their vehicles at Level 2 and 3 standards. Waymo is the exception as they are testing  their  prototypes at Level 4 conditions in the Early Access program me 72, but they are limiting the conditions in  which the vehicles are allowed to drive (e.g., in dry weather areas).   Finally, for the sixth level  (level 5), human attention should not be required at all and, therefore, there would  be no need for pedals, brakes, or a steering wheel. The autonomous vehicle system would control all critical  tasks, monitoring of the environment and identification of unique driving conditions like traffic jams. In this  regard, although no commercial production of a level 5 vehicle exists, some of the aforementioned companies  such as Waymo, Tesla or Uber are currently working towards this goal. As successful  proof -of-concept we find  Nuro73 has been partnering with Krogers  to test small cars that handle deliveries (within a short distance in a  small, controlled area). Also,  Waymo cars are navigating the streets of Arizona with no one behind the wheel74,  but fully self -driving cars are not here yet (TRL 1 to 3).   In general terms, and even if the technology is ready, most cars still sit between levels 1 and 3, typically with few or limited automated functions. There are some exceptions, such as certain Tesla models and Google’s  Waymo featuring a limited set of self- driving ca pabilities (e.g., enabling the car to steer, accelerate and brake  on behalf of the driver), but still these are research projects in initial or testing/trial program mes 75. Indeed,  note that almost every major car manufacturer is currently performing resear ch and testing with self -driving  cars. This is yet another indication that manufactures have not even met the expectations (Narla et al. 2013) or    70 https://www.tesla.com/autopilot   71 https://hondanews.com/releases/honda -targeting -introduction- of-level- 4-automated -driving -capability -by-2025   72 https://waymo.com/apply/   73 https://www.reviewgeek.com/1717/two -ex-googlers -want -nuro -a-new -self-driving -car-to-handle -your -deliveries/    74 https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo -fully -driverless -car-self-driving -ride-hail- service -phoenix- arizona   75 https://emerj.com/ai -adoption- timelines/self -driving -car-timeline -themselves- top-11-automakers/   
  39   the media announcements made just a few years ago76 77 78 79 claiming that by 2020 we all would be  permanent b ackseat drivers80. This provides very gloomy evidence of the complexity and difficulty of the  driving tasks (with the high level  of reliability required (König et al. 2017)), and that even those simplest  subtasks (e.g., tracking other vehicles and objects around a car on the road) are actually much trickier than they  were thought to be.   4.6.2 Technology: Home cleaning robots   Home cleaning robots were one of the expectations of early AI and robotics. Home chores are at the same time  considered to require low quali fication and seen as a nuisance for which automation would represent a  liberation. Many partial (non -AI) solutions have gone in this direction during the 20th century such as washing  machines, non- robotic vacuum cleaners,  and dish washers. However, robotic cleaners started to flourish as late  as the 1990s81. They are currently used for helping humans with many kinds of simple domestic chores such as  vacuum cleaning, floor cleaning, lawn mowing, pool cleaning or window cleaning.    Figure 12 . Readiness -vs-generality chart for home cleaning robot technology. W hile TRL 9 has been clearly reached by  those specialised robots for dusting, vacuuming, mopping etc., lower TRLs are estimated when considering more complex  house- cleaning tasks involving manipulation, flexibility, interaction,  or coordination at any level .    However, despite their popularity, we can analyse how far we are from reaching the original goals if we analyse  these technologies by their level  of generality. We identify the following three levels :    — Level  1 - Specialised cleaning tasks:  In this level  we consider a robot that is able to do a particular cleaning  task in a very specific way, such as dusting, vacuuming, mopping, doing the windows or cleaning the  swimming pool, and other tasks that do not require manipulating new and diverse sets of object s (just    76 https://www.wired.com/story/gms- cruise -rolls -back -target -self-driving -cars/   77 https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/the -most- important -self-driving -car-announcement -yet/556712/   78 https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota -aims -to-make -self-driving -cars-by-2020 -1444136396   79 https://www. autotrader.com/car- shopping/self -driving -cars-honda -sets- 2020 -as-target -for-highly -automated -freeway -driving -266836   80 https://www.theguardian.co m/technology/2015/sep/13/self -driving -cars-bmw -google -2020 -driving   81 An early example of this is the 2001 Electrolux robot vacuum cleaner https://www.electroluxgroup.com/en/trilobite -advert -elubok115- 2/  
  40   well-defined objects such as walls and windows, and avoiding obstacles). In this case, the robot has a  physical configuration that exploits the particularities of the task, either as a roundish device moving on  the floor or a small autonomous drone  doing the windows.   — Level  2 - Specialised cleaning tasks manipulating objects : Here we consider that the task is still specific but  involves the manipulation of a variability of household objects, including removing and putting back  decorations and many other items, fold laundry, iron clothes, etc. (beds do not have a predefined size or  location, clothes are very different, etc.). The robots, still purposed for a single task, may have different  shapes and sizes for each application.   — Level  3 - General clean ing: in this final level  of generality we expect the same robot to do many home  chores. This means that the robot may have a more flexible physical configuration (probably with some  type  of robotic limbs) and a sophisticated interplay between perceptors and actuators. At this level  we are  not implying that these robots must  be humanoid, clean exactly as humans do or use the same  instruments (broom, vacuum cleaners, etc.).     Looking at Figure 12, for level  1, a clear evidence of TRL 9 can be found in the roundish robotic cleaners that  roam around our houses vacuuming and sometimes mopping the floor. Many models exist, with some simple  perception and navigation capabilities.  Most of the innovations in the last decade have been towards better  identifying walls and avoiding stairs using built -in sensors for autonomous navigation, mapping, decision  making and planning. For instance, they are able to scan the room size, identify obstacles and perform the  most efficient routes and methods. Some of them include capab ilities from other categories (such as, speech  recognition for voice commands or even basic conversation capabilities). However, they are still at this level , as  they are not able to manipulate objects. A similar situation happens with other specific tasks  such as windows  cleaning82, pool cleaning, lawn mowing or car washing.   The second level  involves the manipulation of objects, which requires more advanced recognition of the  environment and dexterity. There are current prototypes83 to fold laundry (Bersch et al, 2011; Miller et al.,  2012) or iron clothes84 (Estevez et al., 2020). More complex tasks such as making the bed or clean the  bathroom85 are still a bit below working prototypes. Nevertheless, considering the best situation of all these  specific case s, we have evidence of a TRL 3.   Finally, the third level  is still in very early stages, and we do not have evidence to assign a value beyond TRL 1.  About the near future, innovations  are required at level  2, before moving to significant progress at level  3, with  general -purpose service robots (Walker et al., 2019), which would become the real transformation drivers.  Nevertheless, technology companies working on home robots (e.g., iRobot, Amazon, Samsung, Xiaomi, etc.) are still fighting for some other comp etitive advantages at level  1. For example, they add video conferencing and  voice assistants to their devices rather than the ability to actually manipulate objects or diversify the physical  tasks they can do. While some specialisation may be positive in t he long term for cleaning (as any other  activity), and there are some marketing and economic interests for going in this direction, having dozens of  different gadgets at home has some limitations in terms of maintenance, sustainability and adoption. In the   end, we could even envision the possibility that a robot at level  3 could replace dishwashing machines, vacuum  cleaners and other specialised devices towards a more general home cleaner, especially in small apartments.     4.7 Social and collaborative intelligence   One of the key characteristics for the success of some species and human collectives is that they act as swarms,  herds or social communities. Being able to interact successfully and collaborate with a diversity of other agents  is an important capability that AI has focused on quite intensively, particularly in the area of multi -agent    82 https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/best- window -cleaning -robots/   83 https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L -3768535,00.html    84 https://hel loeffie.com/   85 Some simple products (https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/giddel- toilet -cleaning -robot/ ) and incipient prototypes already exist  (https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/this -bathroom -cleaning -robot -is-trained- in-vr-to-clean -up-after -you/ ). 
  41   systems (Wooldridge 2009). In the last category of this section, we again look for a technology that has limited  overlap with some other categories ( e.g., a robotic swarm would belong to this category and the previous one).  Accordingly, we choose a paradigmatic case of this kind of social and collaborative agents, the technology about negotiation agents . This AI technology is representative of systems that collaborate socially .   4.7.1 Technology: Negotiation Agents   Negotiation is a complex decision -making between two or more peers to reach an agreement, such as an  exchange of goods or services (Jonker et al. 2012). Even if decision theory (Steele et al. 2016) , game theory  (Myerson 2013) and multi -agent theories (Janssen 2002) are consolidated disciplines, many promises for the  technology of negotiation agents are usually expressed as partial automation, i.e., as assistants for a negotiation. Here, we do not wa nt to consider a third dimension about the level of automation, so we will  cover the levels  of generality and the levels of readiness assuming full autonomy: agents that negotiate  autonomously (Jennings et al. 2001). Of course, guidelines and supervision m ay be given by humans (apart  from the objective functions), but these agents should operate autonomously — the typical example is a stock  market agent doing transactions in the night. For instance, this was  the assumption of the automated  negotiating agent s competition (Baarlag et al. 2015), although the latter has incorporated new challenges over  the years 86 (e.g., preference elicitation, human -agent negotiation; supply chain management, etc.).   By negotiation we also consider trading agents (Rodríguez -Agui lar et al. 1998, Wellman 2011) and we are  transparent on the techniques that are used (argumentation techniques87 or others), but we are a bit more  specific than some umbrella terms such as “agreement technologies” (Ossowski 2012, Heras et al. 2012). In th e  end, the history of this area dates back to decision theory and game theory, which can find optimal policies  when the protocol is known as well as the behaviour of other agents (Parsons et al. 2012). Things become more  complicated in situations where age nts can reach local optima instead of more desirable equilibria, or the rules  of the game change during operation. In more general multi -agent systems, especially heterogeneous multi agent systems (Perez et al. 2014), things become even more complicated as  one has to consider that other  agents may have different functions (proactiveness, involving different goal -directed behaviours) or they may  even change. Finally, a more open -ended situation happens when there is bounded rationality, usually given by  reso urces or by constraints imposed by real -time scenarios (Rosenfeld and Kraus 2009) and cases where theory  of mind is needed for negotiation or coalitions (Von Der Osten et al. 2017).     Figure 13 : Readiness -vs-generality chart for negotiation agents technolo gy. Level  1 reaches TRL 9, with some negotiation  bots running in simple scenarios. Level  2 is more challenging, and TRL ranges between 3 and 5. Finally, level  3 is still far  ahead in the future, with an estimated TRL between 1 and 3.     86 https://web.tuat.ac.jp/~katfuji/ANAC2020/    87 Note that considering “argumentation” as a negotiation technique is debatable; different views can be found from the area of computational argumentation, where  negotiation is considered one of the multiple types of argumentative dialogues (see McBurney et al. 2002)  
  42   The levels  we will use for negotiation agents are as follows:     — Level  1 - Homogeneous agents with stable trading rules:  agents can get good trading and negotiation  results if they maximise their utility and choose the immediate best action, independently of the other   agents, or assuming all agents behave equally (homogeneous multi -agent system, with similar utility  functions but possibly different parameters). The market rules are fixed and specific (e.g., a stock market  trader), with no (frequent) local maxima and de adlocks.   — Level  2 - Homogeneous agents with complex trading rules : the trading rules become more complex and  the global regulations can change. Local maxima and deadlocks are frequent and agents should act or  coordinate to avoid them. Here we still assume all agents behave equally (i.e., homogeneous multi -agent  system, with similar utility functions but possibly different parameters). There is no need to model different capacities as all the other agents are assumed to work under perfect rationality wrt. th eir  functions.   — Level  3 - Heterogeneous behaviour with complex trading rules : Here we can now have agents with  bounded rationality, changing goals and erratic behaviour, adversarial or malicious agents, including humans with very different motivations. At this level , we expect agents could benefit from a diversity of  social strategies for negotiation such as persuasion, alliance -building, decoys, lying, manipulation, etc. This  requires modelling the capabilities, goals and mind states of other agents, possi bly in terms of BDI (beliefs,  desires and intentions).     Note that the generality increases mostly because of the complexity and diversity of the trading rules and the  other agents.   Early negotiation agents can be found at level  1 using the basics of decisi on theory (Parsons et al. 2012), and at  this level many negotiating agents do not even need AI (Lin and Kraus 2012) but are coded manually with a few  rules. Many of these systems populate restricted scenarios, such as the electricity grid, where participants must  follow some strict regulations (which try to avoid deadlocks and shortages), but still leave enough flexibility for  trading and rewarding those agents that behave more intelligently in the “smart grid” (Ramchurn et a. 2012).  Still today, some syste ms exist at the macro -level, i.e., companies in electricity markets (Pereira et al. 2014),  illustrated with real -data simulations , but the generalised use of smart agents at homes is still very incipient.  Clearly, the area where trading agents are a develo ped product is in the stock and the currency markets, and  more recently in cryptocurrencies. While they reach high TRLs at this level , there is the question of whether  they really help their users (or owners) make profits 88. Another common case both in research and with  commercial applications is auction sniping as ha ppens with online platforms such as ebay (Hu and Bolivar  2008). According to all this, we can assign TRL 9 to this level .  Level  2 expects the global regulations to change and the utility fun ctions to have different values. These two  aspects are sometimes referred together as “domain knowledge and preference elicitation” and, per 2017, is  considered a “challenge” (Baarslag et al 2017), with some research in terms of on -line or incremental  preference extraction (Baarslag et al. 2015b, Baarslag et al. 2017b), as well as in domain modeling (Hindriks et  al. 2008, Sanders et al. 2008, Simonsen et al 2012). However, in some scenarios such as e -commerce between  companies, there have been some patents being filed 89 (Krasadakis 2016). Furthermore, in (Fatima et al. 2014)  [chapter 12] a number of applications (e.g., grid computing, load balancing, resource allocation, etc.) can be  found regarding trading agents with bounded rationality and limited knowledge about the domain. Given all  the above, we consider a range between TRL 3 and TRL 5 for this level  as all the activity is still in the research  and prototyping phases.   When it comes to level  3, we have seen much activity at the research levels, with met hods with bounded  rationality and heterogeneous utility functions, working for simulations, with specific contexts (Rosenfeld and Kraus 2009) or theoretically (Sofy and Sarne 2014), or considering volatility of information or partial knowledge  (Adam et al.  2014). Only a few are trying to use mind modelling in a general way (Von Der Osten et al. 2017),    88 https://medium.com/@victorhogrefe/how -effective -are-trading -bots -really -1684acc1f496, https://3commas.io/blog/best -crypto -trading -bot  89 https://medium.com/innovation- machine/a -buyer -bot-negotiating -with- a-seller -bot-7026f79ac51e 
  43   but still in restricted scenarios (games). Because of the lack of working evidence in general settings we assume  a value of TRL between 1 and 3 for this level .   Level  3 captures a wide spectrum of possibilities and could be refined in the future as agents start to have  better mind modelling capabilities. However, if we take the high edge of this level , such as understanding and  performing well in complex machin e-human environments, even if only restricted to trading, these are clearly  challenging scenarios even for human scientists (Rahwan et al. 2019), so we expect a long time to reach high  levels at this level .   
  44   5 Discussion: Rearranging the Generality   After the series of ex amples of AI technologies seen in the previous section, organised into one of the seven AI  categories, we can extract general insights from what we observe in the readiness -vs-generality plots more  globally.   Methodologically, the examples ser ve to illustrate the challenges  of estimating the TRLs, a problem that is not  specific to AI. The use of levels  of generality on the x -axis, however, has helped us be more precise with the  TRLs than would be otherwise. In fact, there is no such a thing as TRL 3 or TRL 7 for machine translation, unless  we also specify the level  of generality ( scope of functionality)  for the technology. This is the first take -away of  this methodology. Of course, the levels  in these examples  could be refined and made even more  granular ,  possibly reducing the error bars in some cases. In those cases where there is no standardised scale for the  generality axis (as for self -driving cars or machine translation), an open discussion in the particular community  to find a consensus wou ld be very welcome.   The shapes of the curves seen in the charts of the previous section are informative about where the real  challenges are for some technologies. Going from 70% to 80% in a benchmark is usually a matter of time and can be circumvented with out a radical new innovation, but in many cases going from TRL 1 to TRL 7, for  instance, needs something more profound than incremental research and development. Consequently, it  seems that those curves that are flatter (see Figures 4 -  recommendation engi nes, 8 -  facial recognition, 10 -  transport scheduling systems and 11 -  self- driving cars) look more promising than those for which there is a  steep step at some level  on the x -axis (see Figures 3 - expert systems, 5 -  apprentice by demonstration, 9 -  text  recognition, 12 -  home cleaning robots and 13 -  negotiation agents). Importantly, the shape of the curves  depends on the definition of levels  in the x -axis (all charts are summarised in the following subsection, see  Figure 15).   Refining one level  into tw o or three more granular  levels  may produce a flatter  curve  (e.g., smoothing the  step  curve s). This is  also a good indication of a way in which an insurmountable level  of generality can be  disaggregated into more gradual steps, which may lead to new research and development tracks taking AI to  high TRLs. This is also what happened in the past with some technologies. For instance, robotic vacuum  cleaners added a small, y et relevant, intermediate step that took the technology to TRL 9, created an  ecosystem of companies and users, which in the end paves the way for more research effort and investment in   the following steps or refinements on the x -axis.   In the opposite direc tion to disaggregation, there is also a unifying trend to consider technologies that, by  definition, are expected to integrate many capabilities. A very good example of these integrating AI technologies is represented by virtual assistants, because they ar e expected to cover a wide range of tasks that  integrate capabilities that are associated with many categories in AI, including knowledge representation and reasoning, learning, perception, communication, etc. Let us explore this technology in particular a nd derive its  readiness -vs-generality charts.     5.1 An integrative  AI technology: virtual assistants   Virtual Assistants (VA), also known as intelligent personal assistants or digital assistants, are applications or devices meant to interact with an end user in a natural way, to answer questions, follow a conversation or  accomplish other tasks. VAs have expanded rapidly over the last decade with many new products and  capabilities (EC Report 2018, Hoy 2018). Alexa, Siri, Cortana or Google Assistant are very well -known examples  of this technology. The idea of a computer humans could meaningfully and purposely  dialogue with is also one  of the early visions of AI (Turing 1950), but as with many early visions, it is taking decades to materialise. Having  a meaningful co nversation is not always easy with humans of different backgrounds, culture,  and knowledge,  and making it purposeful (so that the speaker gets things done) is also a challenge in human communication. It  is no surprise then that these are two important hurdles to overcome when trying to get something similar  with machines .   As said above, domain generality is very important, because we want these systems to do a wide range of tasks . However, this is more a desideratum  than a reality, or even a necessity  for some applications. This is  similar to the cases with other AI technologies analysed in the previous section, such as expert systems. In 
  45   particular, making an assistant for a narrow domain (a telecommunication company assistant or a ticket purchasing service avatar) is easier than a more general  assistant (an executive assistant in the workplace).   Given these considerations, we introduce a tentative three- level  scale for generality of virtual assistants as  shown in Figure  14, which may of course be refined in the future.     Figure 14 . Readiness -vs-generality chart for virtual assistant technology. TRL 9 has been reached for systems that work with  predetermined written queries  (generality level 1) , high TRL are more diverse with open- ended spoken queries (generality  level 2) . Finally, the most advanced level  requires generality in terms of domains, types of interactions and queries from the  user  (generality level 3) . Error bars show some uncertainty in the assessment.      The x-axis of Figure 14 reflects three generality levels  of virtual assistants:     — Level  1 - predetermined written queries in one domain : queries are restricted or should contain some  keywords the system recognises to find the topic and some related information.  Answers are either  template -based or pre -recorded as text (possibly read by synthesisers).   — Level  2 - multi -domain spoken queries : text and voice commands can be received with an unrestricted  language, the answers are constructed and not stored. Questions and queries may cover a diverse range of  domains.   — Level  3 - fully open -ended, with user modelling, routine learning and anticipation : the most advanced  level  requires generality in terms of domains, types of interactions and queries from the user. The sys tem  may be proactive rather than just reactive.     In terms of capabilities, and as show n in Figure 14, the simplest VAs ( generality level  1) are conceived as  straightforward software agents able to perform simple tasks or give straight answers based on temp lates or  predefined commands or questions. We can find examples of this type of VAs in commercial products, in the  form of simple chatbots in customer -service applications on websites a nd other apps for restricted (simple)  domains (e.g., ticket purchase as sistants, VAs for QA of Coronavirus -related content90 91, etc. ). Consequently,  we could assign TRL 9 to these assistants .  Focusing on level  2, these VAs should be able to interpret human speech and respond via constructed complex  answers using synthesised voices, sometimes emulating simple dialogues and conversations. Users may be able    90 https://avaamo.ai/projectcovid/   91 https://www.hyro.ai/covid -19  
  46   to ask their assistants (open) questions (with limited proactivity), control home automation devices and media  playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars with verbal  commands. It seems that TRLs are high in this case too. However, although VAs are seen (and marketed) as  intelligent assistants cap able not just of understanding but of taking decisions and fully supporting humans, t his  vision has not fully materialised yet. Currently, there are a number of VA s in the market, with Google Home,  Amazon Echo, Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana (Hoy 2018) being the main examples . These companies are  constantly developing, testing,  and demonstrating new features and capabilities for their VAs, and we can see  this evolution and improvements as new versions are launched on  the market. Because of this, we plot  a range  of values between TRL 7 and 9, as shown in the figure.   Finally, VAs with level 3 of generality are envisaged  to have more advanced capabilities, including background  knowledge so humans will be able to have (professional) conversations and discussions on any topic, more  advanced dialogue management, or improved reasoning about the world, among other things92. In this level ,  VAs are assumed to understand context -based language complexities such as irony, prosody, emotions,  meaningful pauses, etc. We think this is at a rese arch stage today (TRLs 1 to 3). Note that , even in level  3, VAs  are not expected to perform complex rationales or make sophisticated decisions. This is covered by  technologies such as expert systems or planning. Of course, once  high TRLs are  obtained in these technologies  they may  end up being incorporated  in VAs, as they are usually shipped as integrators  of AI services.     5.2 Delineating  technologies more precisely   From the previous discussion we see how important it is to refine the levels of generality such that levels  are  sufficiently crisp for a more accurate assessment of TRLs. This becomes more difficult as the technology is broader, especially those that are defined by integrating capabilities from different categories of AI, such as the  VA in the previo us section. Precisely because of this difficulty, we have to be wary of the bias and  misconceptions our explicit or implicit assumptions of generality can create.   For instance, many funding calls, especially after the H2020 programme, a sk for a particular TRL. While this is  relevant  in calls that are oriented towards products that can be distributed in the market as the project is  completed, it is important to look at the dynamics of readiness -vs-generality charts and the pressure for  avoiding generality . For the purpose of high TRLs, some research projects may be tempted to solve simplified  versions of the problems or solutions for very narrow domains, with many ad -hoc tweaks, rather than solving  the general problem. These calls even encourage that the tech nology is illustrated in one domain, which is  carefully chosen by the researchers as one in which a very specific set of techniques can really work. But, in the  end, the technology may  not extrapolate to other domains, and its transformative effect may be  very limited.  This is particularly important in calls such as FET (Future and Emerging Technologies 93). Of course, some  bottom -up approaches that work in a particular domain end up being generalisable to other domains, but this  should be  explicit for evalu ation purposes.   This generality issue  is also critical in early stages of research. Research papers and benchmarks should  consider a wide range of domains, especially when new principles and techniques are introduced. Otherwise,  their purported performance  should be scrutinised very carefully. Media and the scientific community itself are  usually more amazed by the first time something is achieved (e.g., beating a human master in Go) than how it  is achieved. For instance, the first publications about AlphaG o (Silver et al, 2016) had more public repercussions  than other research papers that followed generalising the techniques for any board game, and without precoded human knowledge (Silver et al., 2017; Silver et al., 2017b; Schrittwieser et al., 2019).   Figure 15 includes a summarised view of all readiness -vs-generality charts. Note that,  there are many other  ways in which we can look at these plots to compare the twelve AI technologies we have analysed. We can see,  for instance, the highest level with TRL -9 as a simple way of comparing the technologies. Alternatively , we can  just focus on the narrowest (leftmost) level . Although , this would give a much promising view of the state of  the art of AI technologies , it has sometimes been the case that s pecialised early stages have paved the way for  more general versions of the technology.     92 https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook -ai-chief -we-want -to-make -smart- assistants- that-have -common -sense/   93 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020- section/future -and-emerging -technologies 
  47       Figure 15 . A composition of all readiness -vs-generality charts from Figures 3 to 14.      On the other hand, asking for too much generality has the risk of entering an area that is not well understood  yet (Bhatnagar et al, 2017, Martínez -Plumed et al. 2020a, 2020b), and a project or a paper may end up aiming  at some vague understanding of “artificial general intelligence” or slip into dubious terms such as “human- level  machine intelligence”, which cannot be properly evaluated (Hernández -Orallo 2020). In contrast, we think that  the use of TRLs, while at the same time being precise and ambitious on how to certify the position on these  readiness -vs-generality charts, may be  of utmost importance to track the impact (Makridakis 2017) of AI and  anticipate the key transformations of the future. We explore this in more detail in the following subsection.   5.3 Assessing TRLs more precisely: the AIcollaboratory   In this report, we have assessed the TRL of each technology (at a particular level ) by asking experts (including  ourselves) to follow the guideline  in the Appendix to estimate the particular readiness level in the scale. A  
  48   wider group of experts, using mor e extensive training on the TRLs and usual methods for aggregation or  consensus of opinions (such as Delphi) would bring more robustness to these estimates, including a systematic  way of deriving the error bars. However, the estimates would still be based on expert evidence but not  quantitative evidence.   There are some sources of information that allow us to assess TR Ls such as the number of patents or the sales  of particular AI -related products. However, we do not think that this information would be suff icient on its own  to understand or quantify the TRL for many AI technologies, especially considering such data is historical (i.e.  analysing the past), and therefore not ideal to address the future -oriented concerns of this report . Coverage on  the media co uld also be a relevant source, and we could use relevant sources such as AI topics94 (Martínez Plumed et al. 2018b, Hernández -Orallo 2020). However, there is an important source of quantitative  information on the progress in AI: benchmarks and competitions  (Hernández -Orallo et al. 2017).   The relation between benchmarks and TRLs is  more complex  than it may seem . Some AI benchmarks (e.g.,  Atari games) would qualify as “simulated environments'' mentioned in the  description of  TRL 5 or TRL 6,  depending on whether only some components or a complete autonomous system are being assessed through  them. Other benchmarks, such as those used for self- driving cars would qualify as "operational testing  platforms" for TRL 7. O ther benchmarks, e.g., some Kaggle competitions , are about real cases and their models  could be applied directly, showing evidence for TRL 8.  Benchmarks sometimes contain standardized  information regarding elements that map onto different TRLs, and therefore can be useful in a TRL assessment.   We have used these connections in some of the assessments in the previous sections. Doing a more systematic  analysis of all benchmarks in AI, its corresponding technology and what kind of technology readiness level  they  could be associated with , would enable a more quantitative approach to estimating TRLs.   In this regard , we could use the AIcollaboratory95 (Martínez -Plumed et al. 2020a, 2020b , 2020c ) to collect  intrinsic information characterising benchmarks and map out the relationships betwee n them and TRLs . This  initiative was conceived for the analysis, evaluation, comparison,  and classification of AI systems, creating a  unifying setting that incorporates data, knowledge and measurements to characterise them. The  AIcollaboratory  is designed to enable this kind of mapping . For the moment, we leave such  mapping and  quantitative analysis for  future work and out of the scope of this report. It is not just the sheer volume of the  endeavour but also because there are some issues to discuss and solv e first in order to  do this meaningfully  and reliably. For instance, most benchmarks are not just pass or fail  but are accompanied by one or more  metrics, such as the performance level , which depend on the application domain and may even be opposed to  each  other for particular tasks . We should determine the minimum level of accuracy in a given  benchmark that  would  be considered sufficient evidence for the associated TRL to be met.   Defining benchmarks to map onto TRLs could generate tension with assessments of the technology's  generality.  For instance, 70% performance on a face recognition benchmark could be considered useful for  some applications and a proof of TRL7 but it may well happen that most of the remaining 30% errors would   focus on a par ticular niche of the technology (e.g., noisy pictures). Would this be evidence of  TRL7 at that  particular level of generality or, rather, would it indicate the technology belongs to a lower level?  We believe  that performance thresholds to assign a TRL shou ld be much higher (e.g., 99%) to avoid this kind of  specialisation problem. Nevertheless, there are other issues, such as systems being specialised to the  benchmark but not to the real problem (so that a TRL7 would never translate into a TRL9). Despite the se  challenges, we do think that clarifying and utili sing the relationship between benchmark  results and TRLs is a  promising avenue of research, which we hope to develop in future work .    94 https://aitopics.org/  95 http://www.aicollaboratory.org/  
  49   6 AI progress through TRLs: the f uture   The analysis of a readiness -vs-generality chart may constitute a useful tool to understand the state of the art of  a particular technology. However, can it be useful  for anticipating the future?   In the first place, as we already mentioned, a static picture can give us hints about what is expected in the near  future. A very steep curve (such as in Figure 4 -  apprentice by demonstration) suggests that there may be a long  way to go from one generality level to the next in the technology to the next one. The gap may include  significant discove ries, results,  or inventions at some low TRLs, which may involve fundamental  research,  usually linked to slower progress. A flatter curve (such as in Figure 7 -  facial recognition) may correspond to  situations where the fundamental ideas are already there,  and progress could be smoother. But this has  another reading, a flatter curve with no level  reaching TRL 9 means that the technology has not reached the  market successfully and the industry ecosystem is non- existent, which would otherwise invest money and   research teams on the problem. Yet, at the same time, this is only  partially true, as some sectors already exist  before automation. For self -driving cars, there is an ecosystem of very powerful automobile multinationals,  with no self -driving car technology until very recently. These companies have invested huge amounts of money  in this technology. Also, some tech giants can go from low TRLs emerging from new techniques to working products in less than a year, as happened, for instance, with the language mo del BERT (Devlin et al., 2018)  being applied to Google’s search engine 96.  To better understand the speed of progress, we also need to consider the notion of technology "hyper adoption", which is related to Gartner’s  Hype Cycle from Gartner (Linden et al. 2 003). This theory states that  people adapt to and adopt new technologies much faster than they used to in the past. This may be partially  caused by the so -called “democratisation” of new technology innovations, as they become available to large  parts of th e population  as soon as they enter the market . For instance, electricity took 70 years for mass  adoption, but the Internet  took just 20 years. The same is happening with AI technologies. A clear example is  the current hyper -adoption of voice -related techno logy 97, with all the tech giants such as Amazon, Google and  Microsoft launching new products every few months. It may be the case that developments  in this sort of  technology has enhanced the adoption rates of voice assistants, and vice versa. The trend ma y even stop  because of ageing populations in many countries, which are more reluctant to wards  technological innovations.   In order to have more ground for  extrapolations we would need a less static picture of the evolution of AI  technologies. Having information about the charts in past years would give us data about how curves evolve,  and how some TRL transitions are faster than others. Of course there may be no clear trends or trends that  cease to hold because of some changes in the AI playground or in society (e.g., a financial crisis, a pandemic or I  the lack of market enthusiasm and/or low investment ). We can do a simple exercise with the VA technology  seen in the previous section. Can we compare the “picture” (i.e., the readiness -vs-generality charts) with a   historical perspective?   6.1 Readiness trends   Figure 14 shows that, in the case of virtual assistants, there has been  important progress at level  2 of generality  in recent years, and level  3 may be changing rapidly to higher TRLs because of high investment and the ubiquity  of VAs of level  2 of generality . We see this evolution from the 1990s, where digital speech recognition  technology became a feature of personal computers of brands such as Microsoft, IBM or Philips, but without   conversational or Question and Answering ( QA) capabilities. In 1994, IBM launched the very first smartphone  (IBM Simon) with some assistant -like capabilities: sending emails, setti ng up calendars and agenda, taking  notes (with a primitive predictive text system installed) or even downloading program mes! However, it was a  menu -based interaction, very different from the assistants we know today. In this regard we may estimate that  som e research on this  was being performed (TRL 1 to TRL 3), mostly focused on  the field of speech recognition.  This went in parallel with advances during the 1970s and 1980s in computational linguistics leading to the development of text comprehension and que stion answering projects for restricted scenarios such as the Unix  Consultant (Wilensky 1987) for answering questions about Unix OS or LILOG (Rollinger 1991) in  the domain of  tourist information. These projects never went past the stage of successful demon strations in relevant  scenarios (TRL 7).     96 https://www.blog.google/products/search/search -language -understanding -bert/   97 https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/06/08/the -hyper -adoption- of-voice -technology 
  50     By the decade of the 2000s, not only were there relevant advances in speech recognition technology, but also  in QA (with market -ready products such as Wolfram Alpha (Wolfram 2009)), Information Retrieval and  knowle dge-Based Systems that paved the way for future VA systems. One important milestone in this decade  was the launch of Google Voice Search in 2002 (Franz et al., 2002). The system allowed users to request  information by speaking to a phone or computer rather  than typing in the search box. This can be considered  as the first step in launching Google’s  VA. This is a significant milestone not only due to the change in the  power -efficient computing paradigm (they offload the processing power to its data centres),  but because  Google was able to collect gigantic amounts of data from billions of searches, which could help the company improve its prediction models of what a person is actually saying. At the same time, IBM also pushed its   research in QA and information  retrieval during this decade (from 2005 onwards) with a  specific goal in mind:  to be able to compete successfully on Jeopardy!  The first prototypes and demonstrations of their system,   Watson (Ferrucci 2012) , were developed and tested between  2007 and 2010, prior to their success in 2011.  From all the above , we may extract that much research, testing and development was being performed in  those areas related to the VA (TRL 3 to 7) even  without market -ready products being launched.   Finally, VAs have witnessed a quick growth in terms of development, products and adoption by consumers  during the last decade. The very first modern digital virtual assistant with voice -based communication  capabilities installed on a smartphone was Siri 98, specifically on the iPhone 4S in 2011. Apple hit the market first  but was soon followed by some big players’ developments and products including Google Now (2012)   Microsoft Cortana (2013) or Amazon Echo (2014 ) (Hoy 2018). As already explained, all these VAs have been  further developed  and improved during the last few years, where manufacturers are constantly testing and  including new and more powerful capabilities (TRL 7 to TRL 9) in terms of interpreting huma n speech (via open  questions), answering via constructed complex outputs, simple dialogue and conversational capabilities, and further advanced control over basic tasks (email, calendar, etc.) as well as home automation devices and media  playback via verbal commands.   For level  3 of generality , VAs are foreseen to have much more advanced capabilities (e.g., background  knowledge, open -domain conversations, common -sense  reasoning, etc.) that were not  found in the research  agenda (TRL 1 to TRL 3) of natural la nguage processing, planning, learning or reasoning until high TRLs have  been obtained for the second level  of generality . Note that  the high TRLs of the latter  were largely due to the  huge advancements in hardware (e.g., computing infrastructure), software  (e.g., powerful neural -based  approaches) and data (e.g., people's behaviour, language corpus, etc.).   Figure 14 . Readiness- vs-generality chart for virtual assistant technology at different moments in time (yellow: 2020, green:  2010, blue: 2000). We see h ow the “curve” has evolved from a steep one in the year 2000 located on the first level  to  another, also steep, f rom the second in 2020.      98 https://www.apple.com/siri/   
  51       Even if there are many uncertainties when assessing and inspecting these curves , with time we think that the  juxtap osed historical view of TRL evolution for a given AI technology is more robust than the evolution of a  single point (the technology at the same level ). And it is much better than the  analysis of the evolution of the   technology mixing levels  on the x -axis, because each period has a  potential horizon for  the technology. With  this usual mistake we could have said that there has been no progress in smart phones in the past ten years  once  the penetration of devices reached near 100%. The percentage of tim e we use them has increased,  because they have increased the generality of tasks and activities they can do, so their transformation goes on.     6.2 AI futures   There are many ways in which AI futures can be extrapolated, from expert panels (Müller and Bostrom 2016, Betz et al. 2018) to role -play scenarios (Avin 2019). There are also many visions about what will be possible in  the future, with mixed success (Kurzweil 2005), poor specification 99 or not meeting any AI forecasting  desiderata100 (Dafoe 2018, Ap. A). Be relying on  measurable indicators , it is possible to  connect the progress in  AI with some economic indicators (such as the PREDICT dataset101). In this paper, however, we have adopted  an approach based on TRLs, to describe the state of the art of a discipline (which may be of use in applications  such as project assessment or product development). For this reason, we have outlined some ideas on how to use this methodology for forecasting purposes.   The truth is that we are still terribly bad at predi cting what  capabilities and products will become a reality even  in the short term, a problem that is not specific to  AI but all technology, and particularly  digital technologies.  We are not always successful, even with  hindsight (Martínez -Plumed et al. 201 8b), in understanding why some  potentials are not fulfilled , and why some technologies have limitations, and what kind of new technologies  may replace them (Marcus 2020). While some criticisms in the early days of AI were related to scalability (the  ideas worked for toy problems but were intractable in general), more recently most criticisms of AI are related   to the lack of generality of current AI technologies. This is one reason for expressing generality as a dimension  in our representations and measurements and is key to determine the maturity of a technology and forecast its  transformative power.   Generality is also a key element when related to mass production and hence society's digital transformation . If  a system is specialised for one particular domain, the return on investment — R&D investment — would be  smaller than if the technology is applicable to  a wide range of areas. Even a minor gain that takes place in many  devices usually represents more mon ey than a major gain in a few devices. Of course, many of these devices or  apps can still be very specific (e.g., a watch), so this does not necessarily go in the direction of  full generality  but can still achieve massive penetratio n. When a widespread sys tem becomes more general (e.g., a mobile  phone, useful for calls and SMSs, turns into a smart phone, with apps), the transformation becomes huge. It is no wonder that virtual assistants, which can be distributed on every device (from phones to smart homes) , if  combined with a highly -general of tasks, may represent a major transformation in the years to come. Hence  the interest by tech giants in investing in this technology.   If the dimensions are right, high TRLs for high -level  (i.e., broad) generalities sho uld indicate potential short term or mid -term massive transformative power  (see, for instance, Figures 6 -  speech recognition, 7 - facial  recognition, 8 -  text recognition or 10 -  self- driving cars). However, generality requires effort, and has  associated costs. There are some internalities and externalities about a technology (e.g., environmental  footprints, user privacy, skill atrophy, etc.) that should be consider ed refining  these predictions. For instance, a  given technology can be ready but the costs o f deployment may not be affordable for the consumers  (these  costs can include  data, expert knowledge, human oversight, software resources, computing cycles, hardware  and network facilities, development time, etc., apart from monetary costs  for research and  development )  (Martínez -Plumed et al. 2018a, Spelda et al., 2020). For instance, self -driving car technology can be based on    99 https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yy3FCmdAbgSLePD7H/how -to-write -good -ai-forecasting -questions -question- database    100 Indicators for relevant AI -related achievements  (e.g., a new capability that would pose a substantial employment threat to a large group of people)  101 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/2018 -predict -dataset 
  52   radar or cheap cameras. While mass production can reduce the cost of radars, having self -driving capabilities  for cheap cars (those  most people have) may give advantage to technologies that rely on computer vision  rather than radar tracking102. Even if a device is flooding the market, that does not mean it will be used  extensively: if the novelty just wears off, it will be forgotten sh ortly after (as happens with many gadgets) .  Sometimes products are sold before they are effectively ready , just to make a positioning in the market, or  because of some other commercial reasons such as meeting customers’ expectations. The success of a  technology is therefore an even more difficult variable to estimate, as many social and economic factors may  interplay (Schilling 1998). For instance, if a technology is deployed too early, it may rebound with a backlash  from consumers (e.g., Microsoft Clippy created aversion against assistants (Veletsianos 2007, PCMagazine  2001)), or human labour costs may fluctu ate, accelerating or slowing the adoption of certain technology ( e.g.,  mechanisation and automation have facilitated an increase in the speed of production ( Miozzo et al. 2005,  Borghans et al. 2006, Suri 2011) )). In other words, technological readiness does not mean technological  success . Analysing all the factors contributing to such success  is out of the scope of this paper, and in the case  of AI may require a particular analysis in the same way we have done here for the TRLs , but in terms of  technology s uccess rather than maturity.   What we have covered in this paper is an example- based methodology where (1) we identify the technology,  its category and its scope, (2) we recognise and define the levels  of generality that are most meaningful for the  technolo gy and appropriate to estimate the TRLs accurately, (3) we find evidence in the scientific literature and  industry to identify the points on the readiness -vs-generality chart, and (4) we use the chart to understand the  state of the art of the technology an d extrapolate its future trends. The examples selected in this paper are also  sufficiently representative for a discussion about the future of AI and how these charts can be used for short term and mid -term forecasting.   As future work, there are many avenu es we would like to see explored. First, the reliability of the assessments  could be increased by using external experts for each chart . There is an opportunity for a consultation with the  AI community asking for their views , suggestions,  and evidence of  the TRL levels . With a larger and wider group  of experts methods such as Delphi  could be used.  Furthermore, we could develop new  scales based on  generality, autonomy, intelligence, etc. , better understanding the different AI technologies and their evolution.  We could also derive the TRLs  from the results of the related  benchmarks for each technology, as discussed at  the end of the previous section. Second, covering many more AI technologies and their evolution would give a  more complete picture than what we portray here, with a choice of representative AI technologies. Third, for  many technologies there is an important discussion about the “ right ” levels  of generality. In some cases there  may be different scales or even multidimensional (e.g., hierarchical) s cales to explore.  Finally, there is also an  opportunity to use the proposed methodology and results to generate an agenda of challenges for AI, particularly for those higher levels of generality which are currently acting as constraints  to higher TRLs.   There is an enormous interest in the futures of AI and its impact. But massive impact can only be reached when the technology is really transformative. This only happens when new ideas, expertise and innovation reach  maturity and they are widely applicable. Using the technology readiness levels and combining them with levels   of generality, as we have done i n this paper, can allow for the exploration of fresh perspectives on the state of  the art  of artificial intelligence, and how it may come to affect  our society in the near future.       102 It has been argued that episodes of acceleration in technological progress were driven by particular General Purpose Technologies (GPTs) as this sort of technologies  have the power to change the pace and direction  of economic progress. Illustratively, i n (Petralia 2017) the case of electrical and electronic technologies is discussed.

63 Appendix A: Technology Readiness Levels Rubric   In this appendix, we include more detail about each TRL in the form of a rubric, as has been used to assign the  TRLs in this document. These extended descriptions have been adapted from some “TRL calculators”103 104,  developed by the US Air Force Research Laboratory developed for assisting in the process of evaluating the TRL of project or product. Each entry below includes level, title, rubric question, description,  and main  characteristics.   TR L - 1 Basic principles observed - Have basic principles been observed and reported?   Lowest level of technology readiness. Research begins to be translated into applied research and development. Examples might include paper studies with the basic properties of a technology.   —  "Back of envelope" environment   — Basic scientific principles observed   — Research hypothesis formulated   — Mathematical formulations of concepts that might be realisable in software   — Initial scientific observations reported in scientific journals, co nference proceedings and technical reports TR L - 2 Technology concept formulated - Has a concept or application been formulated?   Invention begins. Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented. Applications are speculative an d there may be no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumptions. Examples are limited to  analytic studies.   —  Desktop environment    — Paper studies show that application is feasible    — An apparent theoretical or empirical design solution identified    — Basic elements of technology have been identified   — Experiments performed with synthetic data   — Individual parts of the technology work (no real attempt at integration)    — Know what experiments you need to do (research approach)   — Analytical studies re ported in scientific journals, conference proceedings and technical reports   TR L - 3 Experimental proof of concept - Have analytical and experimental proof of concepts been  demonstrated?   Continued research and development efforts. This includes analytical  studies and laboratory studies to  physically validate analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology. Examples include components that are not yet integrated or representative.   —  Academic environment   103 https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2003/systems/nolte2.pdf , https://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm/attachment/download/100020 .   104 US Air Force Research Laboratory “TRL Calculator” (for Excel):  ( http://aries.ucsd.edu/ARIES/MEETINGS/0712/Waganer/TRL%20Calc%20Ver%202_2.xls )
64 —  Preliminary system performance characteristics and measures have been identified and estimate  — Outline of software algorithms available   — Laboratory experiments verify feasibility of application    — Metrics established    — Experiments carried out with small representative data sets   — Algorithms run on surrogate processor in a laboratory environment   — Existing software examined for possible reuse   — Limitations of presently available software assessed (analysis of current software completed)    — Scientific feasibility fully demonstrated    — Analysis of present state of the art shows that technology fills a need   TR L - 4 Technology validated in the laboratory - Has a breadboard unit been demonstrated in a laboratory  (controlled) environment ?  Basic technological components are integrated to establish that they will work together. This is relatively "low  fidelity" compared to the eventual system. Examples include integration of “ad hoc” software and/or hardware  in the laboratory.   —  Controlled laboratory envi ronment   — Individual components tested in laboratory or by supplier    — Formal system architecture development begins    — Overall system requirements for end user's application are known    — Analysis provides detailed knowledge of specific functions so ftware needs to perform   — Technology demonstrates basic functionality in simplified environment   — Analysis of data requirements and formats completed    — Experiments with full scale problems and representative data sets    — Individual functions or modules demonstrated in a laboratory environment    — Some ad hoc integration of functions or modules demonstrates that they will work together    — Low fidelity technology “system” integration and engineering completed in a lab environment  — Functional work breakdown struct ure developed   TR L - 5 Technology validated in a relevant environment - Has a breadboard unit been demonstrated in a  relevant (typical; not necessarily stressing) environment?   Fidelity and reliability is significantly increased. The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulated environment. Examples include “high fidelity” laboratory integration of components.   —  Laboratory environment modified to approximate operational environment   — System interface requirements known    — System software architecture established   — Coding of individual functions/modules completed  
65 —  High fidelity lab integration of system completed, ready for test in realistic or simulated environment   — Individual functions tested to verify that they work   — Individual modules and functions tested for bugs   — Integration of modules/functions demonstrated in a laboratory environment   TR L - 6 Technology demonstrated in a relevant environment - Has a prototype been demonstrated in a  relevant environment, on the target or surrogate platform?  Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond that of TRL 5, is tested in a relevant  environment. This represents a major step up in the demonstrated readiness of a technology. Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment.   —  Operating environment for eventual system known   — Representative model / prototype tested in high- fidelity l ab / simulated operational environment   — Realistic environment outside the lab, but not the eventual operating environment    — Prototype implementation includes functionality to handle large scale realistic problems   — Algorithms partially integrated with exist ing hardware / software systems    — Individual modules tested to verify that the module components (functions) work together    — Representative software system or prototype demonstrated in a laboratory environment    — Laboratory system is high -fidelity functiona l prototype of operational system   — Limited software documentation available   — Engineering feasibility fully demonstrated   TR L - 7 System prototype demonstration in operational environment - Has a prototype unit been  demonstrated in the operational environment?   Represents a major step up from TRL 6, requiring demonstration of an actual system prototype in an  operational environment. Examples include testing the prototype in operational testing platforms (e.g., a real world clinical setting,  a vehicle, etc.) .   —  Each system/software interface tested individually under stressed and anomalous conditions   — Algorithms run on processor(s) in operating environment    — Operational environment, but not the eventual platform    — Most functionality available for demonstration in simulated operational environment   — Operational/flight testing of laboratory system in representational environment   — Fully integrated prototype demonstrated in actual or simulated operational environment    — System prototype successfully tested in a field environment   TR L - 8 System complete and qualified - Has the system/development unit been qualified but not operationally  demonstrated?   Technology proved to work in its final form and under expected conditions. In most cases , this TRL represents  the end of true system development. Examples include developmental test and evaluation of the system to  determine if the requirements and specifications are fulfilled.  
66 —  Final architecture diagrams have been submitted  — Software thoro ughly debugged  — All functionality demonstrated in simulated operational environment   — Certifications and licenses given by regulators    TR L - 9 Actual system proven in operational environment - Has the system/development unit been  demonstrated on an operational environment?   Actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions, such as those encountered  in operational test and evaluation. Examples include using the system under operational conditions.   —  Operational concept  has been implemented successfully   — System has been installed and deployed.   — Actual system fully demonstrated
