 12th January 2021       Dear Executive Vice -President Vestager,   Dear Vice President Jourová,   Dear Commissioner Breton,   Dear Commissioner Dalli,   Dear Commissioner Reynders,   Dear Commissioner Johansson,       cc: Lucilla Sioli,   cc: Juha Heikkilä,     Re: Open letter: Civil society call for the introduction of red lines in the upcoming European  Commission proposal on Artificial Intelligence     We, the undersigned, write to restate the vital importance of clear regulatory red lines to prevent  uses of artificial int elligence which violate fundamental rights. As we await the Commission’s  legislative proposal on artificial intelligence, expected from Directorate -General CONNECT during  Q1 of 2021, we emphasise that regulatory limitations  form a necessary part of a fundamental rights based artificial intelligence regulation .     EU Member States a nd EU institutions have an obligation under the Charter of Fundamental Rights  of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights to ensure that each person’s  rights to privacy, data protection, free expression and assembly, non -discriminatio n, dignity and  other fundamental rights are not unduly restricted by the use of new and emerging technologies.  Without appropriate limitations on the use of AI -based technologies, we face the risk of violations  of our rights and freedoms by governments and  companies alike.     The development of AI offers great potential to benefit people and society. However, socially beneficial  innovation can only be achieved when we guarantee that uses are safe, legal, and do not  discriminate. The European Union now has th e opportunity and the responsibility to ensure  democratic oversight and clear regulation before technologies are deployed.  Europe’s industries -  from AI developers to car manufacturing companies - will also benefit greatly from the regulatory  certainty th at comes from clear legal limits and an even playing field for fair competition.     We, the undersigned, call for  regulatory limits on deployments of artificial intelligence that  unduly restrict human rights.   In addition to strong enforcement of the General  Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR) and safeguards such as human rights impacts assessments, software  transparency and the availability of datasets for public scrutiny, it is vital that the upcoming  regulatory proposal establishes in law clear limitations a s to what can be considered lawful  uses of AI , to unequivocally address the following issues:     • the enabling of biometric m ass surveillance  and monitori ng of public spaces;   • the exacerbation of structural discrimination , exclusion and collective harms;   • the restriction of and discriminatory access to vital services such as health -care and social  security;   • the surveillance of workers and infringement of workers’ fundamental rights;   • the impeding of fair access to justice and procedural rights;   • the use of systems which make inferences and predictions about our most sensitive  characteristics, beha viours and thoughts;  
• and, crucially, the manipulation or control of human behaviour and associated threats to  human dignity, agency, and collective democracy.     In particular, we call attention to specific (but non -exhaustive) examples  of uses that are  incompatible with a democratic society and must be prohibited or legally restricted in the AI  legislation:     1. Biometric mass surveillance :   Uses of biometric surveillance technologies to process the indiscriminately or  arbitrarily -collected  data of people in publicly -accessible spaces (for example, remote  facial recognition) enables mass surveillance and creates a ‘chilling effect’ on people’s  fundamental rights and freedoms. Any deployment of biometric surveillance in public  or publicly -accessible spaces amounts to , per definition, the mass indiscriminate  processing of biometric data. Such use of biometric mass surveillance intrudes the  psychological integrity and well -being of individuals, in addition to the violation of a  vast range of fundamental rights .  As emphasised in EU data protection legislation and  case law, such uses are neither necessary nor proportionate to the aim sought, an d must  therefore be clearly prohibited in the AI legislation  through an explicit ban on the  indiscriminate or arbitrarily -targeted use of biometrics   which can lead to mass  surveillance.  This will ensure that law enforcement, national authorities and private  entities cannot abuse the current wide margin of exception and discretion currently  possible under the exis ting general legal principles of a prohibition on biometric  processing.     2. Uses of AI at the border and in migration control:   The increasing examples  of AI deployment in the field of migration control pose a  growing threat to the fundamental rights of migrants, to EU law, and to human dignity.  Among other worrying use cases, AI has been  tested to purportedly detect lies  for the  purposes of immigration applications at European borders and to monitor deception in  English language tests  through voice analysis, all of which lack credible scientific basis.  In addition, EU migration policies  are increasingly underpinned by AI systems, such as  facial recognition, algorithmic profiling and prediction tools for use within mig ration  management processes, including for forced deportation. These use cases may  infringe  on data protection rights, the right to privacy, the right to non -discrimination, and  several principles of international migration law, including the right to seek asylum.  Given those concerns  and the significant power imbalance that such deploy ments  exacerbate and exploit, there should be a ban or moratorium on the use of  automated technologies  in border and migration control until they are   independently assessed to determine compliance with international human rights  standards.     3. Social scoring and AI systems determining access to social rights and benefits   AI systems have been deployed in various contexts in a manner that threatens the  allocation of social and economic rights and benefits. For example, in the areas of  welfare resource allocation , eligibility assessment and fraud detection, the deployment  of AI systems to predict risk, verify people’s identity and calculate their benefits greatly  impacts people’s access to vital public services and has a potentially grave impact on  the fundamental right to social security and social assistance. This is due to the  likelihood of discriminatory profiling, mistaken results and the inherent fundamental  rights r isks associated with the processing of sensitive biometric data. A number of  examples demonstrate how automated decision -making systems are negatively  impacting and targeting poor, migrant and working class people, including t he 
deployment of SyRI  in the Netherlands and the use of data-driven systems in Poland  to  profile unemployed people, with severe implications for data protection and non discrimination rights. F urther, uses in the context of employment and education have  highlighted highly -intrusive worker  and student  surveillance, including social scoring  systems, intensive monitoring for performance t argets , and other measures which limit  work autonomy, diminish well -being and limit  workers’ and students’ privacy and  fundamental rights. There are have also been  cases  of discriminatory use of AI  technologies against persons with disabilities  by state and private entities in the  allocation of social benefits and access to education. The upcoming legislative  proposal must legally restrict uses and deployments of AI which unduly infringe  upon access to social rights and benefits.     4. Predictive policing:   Uses of predictive modelling to forecast where, and by whom, certain types of crimes  are likely to be committed repeatedly score poor, working class, racialised and migrant  communities with a higher likelihood of presumed future criminality. As highlighted by  the European Parliament , deployment of such predictive policing can result in “grave  misuse”. The use of apparently “neutral” factors, such as postal code, in practice serve  as a proxy for race and other protected characteristics, reflecting histories of  overpolicing of certain communities, exacerbating racial biases and affording false  objectivity to patterns of racial profiling . A number of predictive policing systems have  been demonstrated to disproportionately include racialised people,  in complete  disaccord with actual crime rates. Predicti ve policing systems undermine the  presumption of innocence and other due process rights by treating people as  individually suspicious based on inferences about a wider group.  The European  Commission must legally prohibit  deployments of predictive policing systems in  order to protect  fundamental rights.     5. Use of risk assessment tools in the criminal justice system and pre -trial context   The use of algorithms in criminal justice matters to profile individuals within legal  decision -making processes presents seve re threats to fundamental rights. Such tools base  their assessments on a vast collection of personal data unrelated to the defendants’  alleged misconduct. This collection of personal data for the purpose of predicting the  risk of recidivism cannot be perce ived as necessary nor proportionate to the perceived  purpose, in particular considering the implications for the right to respect for private life,  and the presumption of innocence.  In addition, substantial evidence  has shown that the  introduction of such systems in criminal justice systems in Europe and elsewhere has  resulted in unjust and discriminator y outcomes. Beyond this, it may be impossible for  legal professionals to understand the reasoning behind the outcomes of the system. We  argue that legal limits must be imposed on AI risk assessment systems in the  criminal justice context.     These examples i llustrate the need for an ambitious artificial intelligence proposal in 2021 which  foregrounds people’s rights and freedoms. The signatories of this letter call for the legislative  proposal on artificial intelligence to include:     1. An explicit ban on the indiscriminate or arbitrarily -targeted use of biometrics  in public or  publicly -accessible spaces which can lead to mass surveillance;   2. Legal restrictions or legislative red -lines on the uses which contravene fundamental rights,  including, but not limited to, uses of AI at the border, predictive policing, systems which  restrict access to social rights and benefits, and risk -assessment tool s in the criminal justice  context;  
3. The explicit inclusion of marginalised and affected communities in the development of EU  AI legislation and policy moving forward.     We look forward to a legislation which puts people first, and await your response about how the  upcoming artificial intelligence p roposal will address the concerns outlined in this letter.
