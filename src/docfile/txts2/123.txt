                  8 December 2020       CEPEJ(2020) 15Rev      EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR THE EFFIC IENCY OF  JUSTICE   (CEPEJ)       Possible introduction of a mechanism for  certif ying artificial intelligence tools and  services  in the sphere  of justice and the judiciary :     Feasibility S tudy       In December 2018, the European  Commission for the Efficiency of Justice  (CEPEJ) adopt ed the  Ethical  Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems and their environment . The CEPEJ Charte r  represents the first step in the CEPEJ’s efforts to promote responsible use of artificial intelligence (A I) in  European judicial  systems, in accordance with the Council of Europe’s  values . Mindful of the need to support  the implementation of the Charter , the CEPEJ Working Group on the Q uality of Ju stice (CEPEJ -GT-QUAL)  has explored  the possibility of introduc ing a mechanism  for certifying AI  solutions  in accordance with the  principles of the Charter .      This feasibility study was drawn up under the  supervision of CEPEJ -GT-QUAL  by Mr Matthieu Quiniou  (France), a scientific expert , barrister at the Paris Court of Appeal and lecturer/researcher  at Paris 8 Universit y.        As adopted at the 34th plenary meeting of the CEPEJ,   8 December 2020

3 Feasibility st udy on the possible introduction of a mechanism  for certif ying artificial  intelligence tools and  services     Introduction      Justice is not currently the  preferred focus of companies that are  innova ting in the field of artificial intelligence .  That much is clear from  the Forbes 2019 classification of America's most promising artificial intelligence  companies for example, which does not include a single company that could be categorised as operating  in  the legal or  judicia l spheres1. This can be put down to the  specific nature of the law market , its complexity, the  regulatory  barriers blocking access to it and also its  minor  economi c importance. According to International  Monetary Fund  estimates, the law market worldwide constitutes barely more than 1% of the world's  annual   GDP , accounting for around  1 trillion2 of a total  80 trillion  euros3. A French  study gauging the economic  importance of the law mark et described it as being e quiva lent to that of the air  transport, advertising or drinks  sectors4. And yet  artificial intelligence  in the legal sphere is  an issue of primary importance for society when it  comes to predictive policing or automation of judicial decisions.     A number of " LegalTech " compani es innova ting in the legal  sector and some S tates are now offering  services  using artificial intelligence  to improve and personalise the results of  legal data base  searches  and facilit ate  decision -making, notably for  provision in a context  of litigation . The most  ambitious  mechanisms go as far as   calcul ating the  risks of reoffending , although such tools have  sometimes been discarded after being   experimented with on ethical grounds or because they performed poorly, as was the case with the  COMPAS  system in the United States5.    This s tudy is based mainly on  the CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial intelligence   (hereinafter "the Charte r"), as a direct  follow -up to it , but also on the following works :   - Study on the human rights dimensions of automated data processing techniques (in particular  algorithms) and possible regulatory implications, Council of Europe study, DGI(2017)12 prepared by  the Committee of experts on internet intermediaries (MSI -NET);   - White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust, COM(2020) 65  final.     This study also took note of  the ongoing work of the ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI),  recently established by the Council of Europe 's Committee of Ministers.     The in -depth s tudy on the use of  AI in judicial  systems, notably AI applications processing judicial decisions  and data , reprodu ced i n Appendix  I to the  CEPEJ  Charte r6, defines the main categories  of artificial  intelligence   in the sphere of justice  for illustrative  purposes as follows :   - Advanced case -law search engines   - Online dispute resolution ,  - Assistance in drafting deeds   - Analysis (predictive, scales ),  - Categorisation of contracts according to different criteria  and detection of divergent or incompatible  contractual clauses,   - "Chatbots " to inform litigants or support them in their legal proceedings .    Two additional categories with strong ethics implications could also be discussed, namely algorithmic justice,  which could be seen as comparable to the aforementioned category of "online dispute resolution", and tools  for enhanced judges' decision -making , which could be linked to the  "Analys is" category, still at an  experimental   stage chiefly geared to aid for determining  damages  and sanctions.       1https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/09/17/ai -50-americas -most -promising -artificial -intelligen cecompanies/#27f6479e565c    2https://www.prnewswire.com/news -releases/legal -services -market -to-be-driven -by-globalization -and-reach -1-trillion -by2021 -the-business -research -company -300886604.html    3https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2010&ey=2017&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=cou ntry&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=60&pr1.y=13&c=001%2C998&s=NGDPD&grp=1&a=1    4 Day One and Bruno Deffains, Le poids économique du droit en France, 2015, 22 pages.   5 Jeff Larson, Surya Mattu, Lauren Kirchner and Julia Angwin, How We Analyzed the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm,  Propublica, 2016 https://www.propublica.org/article/how -we-analyzed -the-compas -recidivism -algorithm   6 CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems and their environment, Appendix  1, page 17.  
4 As regards certification, these technological solutions are sufficiently different in terms of purpose and the use  made of artificial intelligence that it might be envisaged either to certify only one category of those uses or to  establish several sub -categories of certification with differentiated procedures and criteria .  At the  CEPEJ -GT-QUAL meeting on  18 June  2020, it was emphasised that the  cases of AI use  that could be   assimila ted to  predictive jus tice had the strongest ramifications for  fundamental rights and freedoms and  should therefore be focused on within the  present s tudy.    In addition to this diversity in terms of technological progress, functionalities and uses of artificial intelligence  applications in the judicial sphere, we should also take into consideration the fields of law and specific  characteristics of courts by legal sector.  It should firstly be pointed out that some fields of law are more  sensitive than others, owing to the ramifi cations of judicial decisions for personal freedoms.  Criminology and  criminal law are generally identified as fields of law where the use of artificial intelligence is to be envisaged  with the utmost caution.  Furthermore, to take the specific case of Fra nce, decisions are handed down,  depending on the case, by courts made up solely of professional judges, by lay auxiliary judges,  by trade union  representatives or  by juries.  Other judicial systems, often in the English -speaking world, make a point of  allowing judges' dissenting opinions to be transcribed.  This diversity of judges is a source of creativity and a  means of building  bridges between society and law.  There are numerous reports highlighting the risk of case law becoming ossified by artificial i ntelligence reproducing carbon -copies of positions definitively laid down by  supreme courts (whose role is indeed to harmonise a constantly evolving law) .     The main  typolog y of artificial  intelligence systems  distingu ishes between  symboli c (or human -reada ble)  systems and  conne ctionist (o r purely machine -readable ) systems . Symboli c artificial intelligence systems   hinge on ru les laid down by their designer  to enable  machine s to take  decisions on the basis of a  pre-defined   model. This form of artificial intelligence  has been used for many years in  expert system s, and  in the legal  sphere it is chiefly used for  chatbots  and also for constraint programming , for example using tree structures to   automati cally generate  complex contra cts from simple q uestions. Conne ctionist  artificial intelligence systems   are probabilist ic and  operate through inducti on and  iteration in order to look at  data and deduce charact eristics  that might become  indicators and be used to interpret data sets . Training connectionist artificial intelligence  systems  requires both  big data and sufficient computing power to process the data within a  limited  time.  Connectionist artificial intelligence systems  are the kind that would be used, for  example , to define a  strategy  for litigation or set a  sanction on the basis of a substantial collection of case -law.    Fundamental rights and freedoms appertain to human ontology, which differs from the functional approach of  machines, even  so-called  intelligent ones.  Unlike inanimate objects or machines with pre -programmed or  strictly circumscribed behaviour, it is precisely the ability of artificial intelligence to go beyond the statistical  model proposed and its constant improvement through successive iterations that define it .     Certification of conne ctionist  artificial intelligence may be carried out at several levels: at the level of the  learning model ( supervise d or not,  scientific validity of the protocol and learning bias), at the level of the data  used (validity of the data item, securing of the database and exclusion of certain sensitive data) and at the  level of the results (adverse impact on fundamental rights and freedoms)   .    The most evolved forms of artificial intelligence  - systems that are  conne ctionist  with unsuperv ised learning  and adaptative (non -determinist ic) - process data on a contextualised basis, making discrimination breaching  fundamental rights and freedoms more difficult to spot for humans not assisted by meta -intelligence that is  specifically trained for the task. Furthermore, the constantly evolving nature of artificial intelligence  necessitates continuous certification monitoring, possible for example by adapting the model used for indexing  robots  and by  creating plugins.     Besides these considerations l inked to the  categories of artificial intelligence and its state of technological  advancement in terms of contextual learning, we should distinguish between AI applications in the justice  sphere according to their functions and purposes .    The response  of CEN -CENELEC  to the White Paper in June  20207 (COM(2020) 65 final ) stressed the  importance of considering  specific applications and secto r-specific issue s where standards and  certification of  artificial intelligence  system s are concerned8. Noting the l ack of established standards in the field of artificial  intelligence, CEN -CENELEC propose s in its  recommendations that i nspir ation be drawn from the EU Ecolabel,    7 CEN -CENELEC response to the EC Whit e Paper on AI, June  2020.   8 Ibid. p.6 "Furthermore, depending on the specific application various aspects (safety, fairness, privacy, security) have  different relevance which must be considered by such a labelling scheme ". 
5 the certification scheme for cybersecurity  now being  finalis ed and  national labelling schemes  in Denmark and  Malta9.    The questions focused on as a  priorit y in the  present s tudy will relate to the typology and challenges of  certification and labels (I) and the objectives of CEPEJ certification  (II). The s tudy will also set out the issues  linked to certification  deployment , in terms of certification authorit ies (III), governance structure (IV), a s well as  the risks and opportunities entailed in such  certification by the  CEPEJ (V) and the  issues of  responsibilities  linked to  certification deployment (VI). The future European Union regulations on artificial intelligence  will be a  further consideration for the study  (VII) and a schedule and roadmap  will be  sugg ested  (VIII).     I. State of play, typology  and challenges of standard s, certification and labelling     The ethical  certification of artificial intelligence app ears to be an  important issue in  strategic area s in which   algorithmi c black boxe s are inadmissible  in a democratic society . European companies in strategic  sectors are  in favour of reliable and explainable  certified artificial intelligence, often in contrast to the big American IT  companies ( GAFAM )10. European companies ' need for  certification is appar ent, for example, in a statement  by Groupe Thales  chairman  Patrice Caine , who said : "Artificial intelligence will soon be at the centre of all of  our daily lives. Our customers in the aerospace, space, ground transportation, defence and security sectors  are in charge of systems that are critical to the security of our societies, so it is vitally important to ensure that  AI works as intended, to explain why it behaves in a given way, and to verify its use. That is why Thales is  committed to making AI trustab le, explainable, certifiable and ethical "11.    I.1 Implications of the choice between mandatory and optional certification     Generally sp eaking, the main aim of  techni cal standards  is to cater for market needs, particularly in terms of   compatibilit y, and  certification  also acts as an incitement to encourage the actors involved to adopt  a certain  conduct . For them, standards and  certification  system s can determine the launch of products on the market,  how produ cts or service s are present ed and also the  criteria to meet when  responding to  public  and sometimes   private call s for tender .    In princip le, both certification  and compliance with  techni cal standard s for produ cts or services are on a   voluntary basis . That said, there may be regulations making  certain techni cal standard s mandatory, such as  the European Union  directives on the CE marking of  certain produ cts.     One purpose of t echni cal standards and  certification  system s is to enable  cons umers to easily  determine   produ ct or service qualit y in market  comparison s, which i n princip le promotes competition . However, when  such technical standards and certification  are difficult  to attain , this may act as a brake on competition by  making it difficult for newcomers to gain  access to the  market, particul arly in the case of mandatory or  semi mandatory  standards or certification .     It should also b e note d that mandatory or quasi -mandatory label ling preventing  services from using  artificial  intelligence  black boxes  that cannot be  interpreted or  fail to comply with ethical  princip les could very   significa ntly impact the a bility of large tech companies to  market their  services in certain regions , unless they  rethink the way they do things . Labelli ng or  certification of this kind could  set objective criter ia for  protecti ng  users of such  services and avoid  diplomati c row s, such as the one i n 2020 between the  United States and the  Chinese company TikTok12.    I.2 Differences in the  certification of symboli c and  conne ctionist  artificial intelligence s ystems     Symboli c artificial intelligence  is based  exclusive ly on  models implemented by their designer; this  type of  artificial intelligence  is determinist ic. Symbolic artificial intelligence hinges on decision  trees that may be fully  interpreted and audit ed. A criterion that is  discriminatory could be easily  identified and modified, the certification    9 Ibid. p.6 "Consider existing labelling schemes in Europe and the correspondent standards as inspiration, e.g. EU Ecolabel,  upcoming certification scheme for Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Act) and national AI labelling schemes (e.g. Denmark,  Malta , etc).   8.2 To build a trustwo rthy and reliable label, standards are needed. Standards which currently do not yet exist. To first  promote the development and acceptance of these standards, before introducing a labelling scheme. After introduction of  a labelling scheme it is important t o keep evaluating its effects ."  10 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft.   11 "Thales illustre le rôle crucial de l’Intelligence Artificielle dans les moments décisifs " [Thales demonstrates the critical  role of AI in decisive moments ], Thales website, 17 January 2019  https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr/group/press release/thales -illustre -le-role-crucial-lintelligence -artificielle -moments -decisifs    12 https://www.reuters.com/article/us -usa-tiktok -china -pompeo -idUSKBN2480DF   
6 of this  type of artificial intelligence  is fairly straightforward to implement and this can be done using database  auditing criteria, criteria  formulation and the decision tree .     In contrast, standardising and  certif ying connectionist  artificial intelligence, especially systems  functioning with  unsupervis ed learning , is complex and still at the outline stage . Currently, the main challenge is gaining a  precise understanding of the steps in the  machine 's reasoning without  restricting its scope for producing   original and  pertinen t interpretations. Some  authors have suggested two  distin ct methods for rendering  artificial  intelligence interpretable : either to make the  machine less complex  or to apply a method which  analyse s the  model a fter the training  phase13.     At pres ent, there is no  system for direct ly interpreting a connectionist  artificial intelligence  model using   unsupervised learning . Researche rs generally distingu ish between  explainability (commonly abbreviated to   XAI, for "explainable artificial intelligence "), which is the ability to understand the general  effects of the  variables  (the why,) and interpretability, which is the ability to  gauge the i mportance of each  variable in the  result ( the  how) of an  algorithm.     Methods such as  LIME ( Local Interpretable Model -agnostic Explanations ) are used to  facilit ate understanding  of the results  coming out of neural network black boxes14. Evaluations of the  quality of interpretation have  already been put forward, and some  authors have pointed to ethical  problems arising from  "produ cing  explanations that are more  persuasive  than transparent "15.    Studies carried out like those under the  TuringBox  proje ct16 undertaken by researchers from the   Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) may also be useful in  facilit ating work to interpret artificial  intelligence  systems in the legal sphere . This proje ct enables individuals without specific IT expertise to   examine  an artificial intelligence  system by  stimula ting machine behaviour and  analys ing the metrics. One of  the main  plus-points of this tool is  its community of contributors  which makes it possible to share the  analyses  carried out .    Specifically in the judicial field where artificial intelligence tools provide aid for decision -making for judges, if,  for example,  the machine propose s a detention  measure rather than a security measure, the defendant and  society  are entitled to demand an explanation for that choice if it guide s an official  decision of justice. This  necessity  follows on from Article 5  - "right to liberty and security of person" of the Europ ean Convention for the  protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms (hereinafter "the ECHR" ) entailing the obligation of  reasoning of decisions and the requirement of non -arbitrariness17. The reasoning of decisions of  justice  demands a certain level of explainability. In the aforementioned example of an  artificial intelligence  system   propos ing a  detention  measure,  depending on the type of artificial intelligence  used  (symboli c or connectionist ,  with or without supervise d learning ) and the  artificial intelligence  interpr etation  tools made available to the  judge , there will be three possible scenarios: either the judge will be totally incapable of explaining the  artificial  intelligence  decision ; or the judge will be able to identify only one criterion  that is irrational, irrelevant or not a  sufficient basis for a legal argument; or the judge will be able to clearly explain the decision taken by the   artificial intelligence  application . In the first two cases , great care must be taken to avoid s eeking to arrive at  the same finding as the artificial intelligence  system in terms of the sanction  via another reasoning that would  be explainable .     I.3 Certifying an evolving system     By nature, connectionist artificial intelligence is non-deterministic and  capable of  evolving.  Only certain  invariants such as data  sources or the  initial learning model (for those with  supervis ed learning ) can be  certifi ed  on a lasting basis . The successive iterations  of connectionist artificial intelligence render it more  complex  and,  in princip le, more relevant , and yet this increased  complexi ty renders the explainability of the  results more   complex.     13 See Christoph Molnar , Interpretable Mach ine Learning, A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable , lulu.com,  2020, 318 pages.   14 See fo r example, Marco Tulio Ribeiro, Sameer Singh, Carlos Guestrin , “Why Should I Trust You?” Explaining the  Predictions of Any Classifier, Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016, 10 pages.

7   For this  type of non-determinist ic artificial  intelligence  system , certification has to be carried out  continu ally to  be effective . Accordingly, it is possible to envisage  continuous human monitoring for certified artificial  intelligence systems , with the creation , for example , of a function of artificial intelligence  officer within the  companies or administrations propos ing this  type of certified artificial intelligence, along the lines of a data  protection officer (hereinafter " DPO "), or possibly automated monitoring by a symbolic artificial i ntelligence  application , in the form of a plugin,  checking that the connectionist artificial intelligence  it is monitoring still  meets the criteria on which it was initially certified .    I.4 Comparison with certification of personal data processing systems     The certification  of artificial intelligence hinges on analys is of the algorithm, the learning model  and the  quality  of the data  sources. The main aims of  certification  of personal data processing systems are to  verify  compliance with personal data regulations, namely the General Data Protection Regulation  (hereinafter "the  GDP R")18 in the European Union , which primarily entails  certification of procedures for  inform ing and obtaining  the consent  of the individuals whose  data are  collect ed and processed and,  residually , certification of the   precautions and steps taken to secure those data .    As regards person al data since the GDPR 's entry into force , the independent national d ata protection  authorities (members of the  G29),  like the  CNIL  in France, have abandoned  label ling linked to  governance  procedures for data  protection, digital  safe service s label ling and audit  procedure  label ling, and now instead  focus solely on a  standard for  certif ying DPO s and certificat ion bodie s19. As things stand , these forms of   certification  can only be a  source  of inspiration if the aforementioned  function of artificial intelligence  officer is  created . It should b e note d that additional  certification  is almost certain to emerge in  various European Union   Member  State s, as Article 42 of the  GDPR "Certification " encourage s certification  mechanism s and label ling  for the purpose of  demon strating that processing  operations compl y with the  GDPR .    There are also  ISO standards in the area of personal data  protection, notably  ISO/IEC 27701. This international   standard  heralded by  the ISO as the first international  standard for manag ing privacy information20 was  publi shed i n 2019. It reflects the s tate of the  art as regards  protection of privacy and, among other things,   covers the requirements for  creating , implementing and improving  privacy information management systems   (PIMS s)21 and security  issues . This standard may be s een as a prerequisite for a component of certification   for an artificial intelligence system . It should  be noted however that this  ISO/IEC 27701  standard  is not  GDPR  certification within the meaning of A rticle 42 of the  GDPR and forms part of what has been described as a  "grey zone" of standardisation prior to  regulatory authorities placing certification  on a formal footing22.    I.5 CE mark ing of artificial intelligence solutions  seen in context     CE marking is governed by  Regulation (E C) no. 765/2008 in terms of its definition, format and general   princip les. CE marking  is not a  certification mechanism but a  visible commit ment on the part of a manufacturer  to comply with European  legislation. The European  Commission 's Blue  Guide states : "By af fixing the CE  Marking the manufacturer declares on his sole responsibility that the product conforms to all applicable Union  legislative requirements, and that the appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been successfully  completed "23. CE marking  is mandatory only for  certain produ cts, referred to in European  directives. There is  an implicit suggestion in the European Commission  White Paper on  artificial intelligence that a  directive  classifying artificial intelligence  systems as produ cts or service s requiring  CE marking  may be an avenue to  be explored24.     Because the sector in which they operate brings them under one of these directives , some artificial intelligence   applications  are subject to assessments to qualify for  CE marking , notably medical devices using  artificial  intelligence. In this  context, for example in France, the National Health Authority  has rolled out a "Draft  evaluation grid for medical devices using artificial intelligence "25, with a view to  medical devices being included    18 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive  95/46/EC (General Da ta Protection Regulation).   19 For example in France for the CNIL, AFNOR or Bureau Veritas.   20 https://www.iso.org/news/ref2419.html   21 https://www.is o.org/standard/71670.html   22 Eric Lachaud, "ISO/IEC 27701: Threats and Opportunities for GDPR Certification", 2020, 24 pages.   23 European Commission  Notice, The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU products rules 2016 (Text with EEA  relevance) (2016/C 272/01).   24 White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust, COM(2020) 65 final.   25 https://www.has -sante.fr/jcms/p_3118247/fr/projet -de-grille -d-analyse -pour-l-evaluation -de-dispositifs -medicaux -avec intelligence -artificielle   
8 in the list of produ cts and services that may be  reimburs ed. According to  the National Health Authority , this  assessment should be carried out after  CE marking , which may explain why its assessment is organised by   the National Heal th Authority  downstream . That said , a concomitant  or prior assessment might be  envisag ed,  as this issue appears to be more of a consideration upstream of CE marking  and an application for inclusion  on the list of  reimburs able produ cts.     CE marking  therefore seems to be of little relevance to what might be devised in terms of  artificial intelligence  certification, and the European Union does not appear to have embarked upon in -depth discussion of a   directive that could create an  obligation of CE mark ing specific to artificial intelligence systems and even less  so to artificial intelligence in the legal sphere, an area where there is not a single product or  service coming  under a European directive linked to CE marking .     I.6 The Ecolabel for artificia l intelligence solutions  seen in context     The European Ecolabel was created by  Council Regulation (EEC) No 880/92 of 23 March 1992 on a  Community eco -label award scheme  and then  revised by Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco -label award scheme . This voluntary   label ling scheme  makes it possible to attes t to the  environmental quality  of a product during its life  cycle  through compliance with criteria specific to each  produ ct group26. To obtain the Ecolabel, a produ ct must be  subjected to a  procedure for certification by a certif ying authority, and the applicant  must pay the processing  costs and an annual fee thereafter27.     The main point of convergence between the Ecolabel and the  certification of artificial intelligence in the judicial  sphere, whose  feasibility is discu ssed in the  present s tudy, is their  societal objective and their universalist   aspirations .    The Ecolabel strategy is based mainly on the comparison and evalu ation of the  produ cts best meeting the  environmental  objectives28 and takes account of  techni cal progress with a view to regularly updating the   criteria29. A system of certification for the ethical aspects of artificial intelligence could draw on this  comparati ve  and evolutive  approach.     I.7 National s tandards being devised for  artificial intelligence: Malta and Denmark     Malta embarked upon in -depth  thinking on the  regulation and certification of artificial intelligence, with the  production of a  consultation document on the  ethical aspects of artificial intelligence30 in August  2019 , followed  by a strategic document in October 2019 aimed at making  Malta the "Ultimate AI Launchpad "31.    The purpose of the  consultation  on the ethical aspects of artificial intelligence  is to arrive at a code of ethics  for artificial intelligence paving the way for  respect of fundamental rights, among other things . This code of  ethics, yet to be finalised, has some similarities with the CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial  intelligence in judicial systems  but its scope is not limited to the legal and judicial spheres and the approach  taken is intended to fit with M alta's strategy  to be competitive in this sector . The final section of the consultation  document  focuses on the certification  of artificial intelligence  without going into any real detail, the stated aim  being to create trust and  transparenc y between use rs, cons umers and stakeholder s32.    The strategy  document propose s undertaking AI -related  pilot proje cts in government and authorities in various   sectors (traffic management , education, health care , customer service, tourism). The justice sphere has not  been included in the areas listed for experimentation33. The sole  reference to artificial intelligence in the  justice  sphere in this  document is to be seen in a survey finding that  only half of the respondents are comfortable with    26 Article 6, Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised  Community eco -label award scheme.   27 Ibid., Article 12.   28 Ibid. Recital 6: "It is necessary to explain to consumers that the eco -label represents those products which have the  potential to reduce certain negative environmental impacts, as compared with other products in the same product group ,  without prejudice to reg ulatory requirements applicable to products at a Community or a national level".   29 Ibid.

9 AI in the area of justice, compared to  80% in the area of  transport ation34, which appears to have been the  reason why it was  exclu ded from the pilot experiments .    Denmark  is another country that has been actively looking at the labelling of artificial intelligence  based on  ethical criteria . A national strategy for artificial intelligence  was set out in a  government document published in  March  2019 , geared to creating a toolbox for companies and  a data ethics label for artificial intelligence35. The  forthcoming creation of labelling for IT security and responsible data use was announced at the end of 2019   by the Danish  Minist ry of Industr y36.    These national la belling strategies , welcomed by the European Union37 and the OECD38, are still at the design  stage where the ethical ce rtification  of artificial intelligence  is concerned and do not provide any pointers for  a  working basis or points of  comparison for the  present s tudy. That said , these  national  effort s show that the  Council of Europe's member States are keen on having  certification  system s in this  sensi tive area .     I.8 The work of the IEEE to set standards for ethics in the  artificial intelligence  field    The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE)  is a non -profit  organisation formed under  American  law which is highly  active in developing electronics - and IT -related  techni cal standard s and describes itself as  the world's largest technical professional organi sation for the advancement of technology .    Beyond its technical standard -setting work , the IEEE is already at an advanced stage in work  aimed at  standardising "the  future of ethics for autonomous and Intelligent systems ", which  takes the  form of a series of  projects  numbered  P7000™ ,. The proje cts are sequentially numbered up to  14 (skipping no.  13):  - IEEE P7000™: Model Process for Addressing Ethical Concerns During System Design   - IEEE P7001™: Transparency of Autonomous Systems   - IEEE P7002™: Data Privacy Process   - IEEE P7003™: Algorithmic Bias Considerations   - IEEE P7004™: Standard on Child and Student Data Governance   - IEEE P7005™: Standard on Employer Data Governance   - IEEE P7006™: Standard on Personal Data AI Agent Working Grou p  - IEEE P7007™: Ontological Standard for Ethically driven Robotics and Automation Systems   - IEEE P7008™: Standard for Ethically Driven Nudging for Robotic, Intelligent and Autonomous  Systems   - IEEE P7009™: Standard for Fail -Safe Design of Autonomous and Semi -Autonomous Systems   - IEEE 7010™ -2020 IEEE Recommended Practice for Assessing the Impact of Autonomous and  Intelligent Systems on Human Well -Being   - IEEE P7011™: Standard for the Process of Identifying & Rating the Trust -worthiness of News Sources   - IEEE P7012™: Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms   - IEEE P7014™: Standard for Ethical considerations in Emulated Empathy in Autonomous and  Intelligent Systems     Of these ongoing  proje cts, only IEEE 7010™ -2020 IEEE Recommended Practice for Assessing the Impact of  Autonomous and Intelligent Systems on Human Well -Being  has produced a standard to date .    In the list of standardisation projects above, only P7000 to P7003 are truly relevant to the  present s tudy on the   certification of artificial intelligence in the  judicia l sphe re. An outline of the  P7000 draft standard can already  be ordered on  the IEEE 's site but no outline documents ha ve been published yet for proje cts P7001 to 7003.  These  P700X draft standards being devised by the IEEE do not  direct ly relate to the judicial sphere for the  time being and have more to do with e thical conduct or well -being . The questions of transparency (P7001 ™)  and algorithmi c bias (P7003 ™) are key and will have to be taken into account  once  these IEEE standards  have actually been  drawn up, potentially providing pointers for refining the  indicators useful for implementing   Princip le no. 4 of the CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems  and certification  criteria  (see II below ).          34 Ibid., p. 38.   35 Danish Government, National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, March  2019, 74 pages:  https://eng.em.dk/media/13081/305755 -gb-version_4k.pdf    36 https://eng.em.dk/news/2019/oktober/new -seal-for-it-security -and-responsible -data-use-is-in-its-way/   37 White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, A European approach to excellence and trust,  COM(2020) 65 final, p. 13.   38 https://oecd.ai/wonk/an -independent -council -and-seal-of-approval -among -denmarks -measures -to-promote -the-ethical use-of-data  
10 I.9 In tegra tion of labelling into the work of the Council of Europe  (European Pharmacopoeia  and  Cultural  Routes  Label)     The European Pharmacopoeia , set up under the auspices of the Council of Europe by its  member  State s by a  convention in 196439, has gradually opened up to standardis ation  bodies . The Pharmacopoeia  is run by the  Council of Europe  via its European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and HealthCare  (EDQM) which  currently  emplo ys some  400 pe ople of  25 different nationalities. The EDQM has signed a memo randum  of  understanding with the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) concernin g medical devices40.    The factsheet on the EDQM says that the European Pharmacopoeia  is the " official reference work used by  professionals involved in the manufacture and control of medicines. Its objective is to define legally binding  quality requirements  for medicines and their ingredients "41. Compliance with the quality requirements of the  European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) is a prerequisite for medicines to be authorised for the markets of the 39  member States . The binding nature of this  certification provides a solid foundation for the  recommend ations  and criteria defined by the EDQM.     The reason for the EDQM operating within the Council of Europe is that, according to its mission statement,  it  "contribute s to the basic human right of access to good quality medicines and healthcare, and promotes and  protects human and animal health ". The aim of  certification discu ssed in the  present s tudy seems even more  closely geared to the Council of Europe's  human rights  protection missions in seeking to  adapt  them to the  digital univers e, and particul arly to artificial intelligence  systems , in the  judicia l sphe re.    While gained in an area that is very different  from the legal and judicial spheres, the European  Pharmacopo eia's experience  may be highly  instructive for devising binding certification prior to products  coming onto the  market and  structur ing a  certification system from an  institutional  and organisational viewpoint  (see section  IV below ) and in relation to standardisation bodies  and the European Union .     The Council of Europe also runs the  Cultural Routes label ling scheme . A look at the experience  acquired  could  be useful for  devising and  deploying Council of Europe  certification for artificial intelligence, from an   organisational point of view  (see section  IV below ) whether for  defining the  evaluation cycles o r setting up a   certif ying body . The Council of Europe teams involved in implementing the Cultural Routes label could be  asked to provide insight into the specific issues of a  labelli ng system on the scale of the Council of Europe .     The exp erience gained with the Cultural Routes  label ling could prov e to be beneficial  for identifying points of   convergence  and possible  cooper ation with other  international institutions active in  cultural labelli ng which  have also  carried out substantive work on  artificial intelligence, especially the United Nations Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organisation  (UNESCO) and, to a  certain  extent,  the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  (OECD).     I.10 GDPR -style impact  assessment  and certification     Impact assessments  carried out by compani es have been  made systematic by the GDPR, which  impose s this  type of document ation in it s Articles 35 and 36: where person al data processing " is likely to result in a high risk  to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an  assessment of the impact of the envisage d processing operations on the protection of personal data "42.    An impact assessment for  artificial intelligence  system s could b e envisag ed along the lines of the  GDPR  model,  taking account of not only the  consequences for personal data  protection but also  and above all the  societal  and e conomi c impact of  inexplicable  or biased decisions taken by artificial intelligence.        39 Convention on the Elaboration of a  European Pharmacopoeia,  1964, Strasbourg, 22.VII.1964.   40 https://www.edqm.eu/en/History -1964 -1997 -1562.html    41https://www.edqm.eu/sites/default/files/medias/fichiers/Factsheets/factsheet_pheur_reference_standards_july_2020.pd f   42 Article 35, Regulation (EU) 2016/679  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection  of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing  Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) . 
11 I.11 Contextualised artificial intelligence sandboxes and certification     The term  "sandbox" is commonly us ed in the IT field in connection with the testing of  programmes before they  are rolled out , particularly to  spot bugs and en sure good  launch condition s. This is chiefly an IT  security pra ctice  allowing a  programme to be run in a restricted  environment43.    This practice has recently been transpos ed to the legal sphere, with regulatory sandboxes,  initial ly used in the  area of financi al regulation. The pion eering proje ct in this field,  Project Innovate , is a programme run since   2014 by a British financial  regulation body , the Financial Conduct Authority  (FCA). According to the  FCA, it  allows businesses to test innovative propositions in the market, with real consumers . Taking this  approach  makes it possible to  test a produ ct or service in a control led environment, r educe time-to-market , help identi fy  appropriate consumer protection safeguards to build into new products and services before they are put on  the market and secure better access to  proje ct finance44. The pra ctice has become widespread since  2014   and has a strong following throughout the  FinTech sector and also in  artificial intelligence45, notably  in France46  or Finland47.    With a view to Council of Europe  certification  of artificial  intelligence in the  judicia l spher e, one benefit of a  sandbox would be to make the acto rs involved aware of the challenges of  human rights  by design and e thics.  A sandbox would provide a means of  giving them guidance over a  prolonged period as they get to grips with  the conten t of the  CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems and  certification crit eria.     A sandbox would also make it possible to continuously refine and improve  the certification  criteria to closely  match practice and develop ments on the technical side .    For those proposing  artificial intelligence  proje cts in the  judicia l sphe re, in addition to the  certification they may  obtain during or at the end of sandbox testing, this support could help improve their  product' s chances of  commercial success, as their customers  (States, administrations, regulated law professionals etc) will be   particul arly attentive to compliance  with regul ation s and the  effort s made to achieve this . For proje cts pursued  direct ly by S tates or administrations, a sandbox, and more  generally certification in this area, would  provide  useful  support in  aligning them with supranationa l standards  and reducing risks of  the European Court of  Human Rights  ruling against them in a strategic area .     Nonet heless, since, as pointed out earlier,  conne ctionist artificial intelligence  applications are system s that  evolve, the certification a warded , after sandbox testing fo r example, cannot be  definitive ly acquired .    Since there is currently no  artificial intelligence certification in the  judicia l sphe re to serve as a  source of  inspiration, thoughts have been turned to the certification of artificial intelligence , and, more  global ly, invariants  in the certification  process make it possible to des ign such  a tool . The experience gained by the Council of  Europe in labelling and  certification in connection with  cultur al route s and the  European Pharmacopoeia  may  prove useful for  structur ing the  certification envisage d in institution al terms . Moreover, this  certification could  be a means of disseminating and ensuring the  effective appli cation  of the CEPEJ European Ethical Charter  on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems , through  support and guidance methods such as  sandboxes .    II. Formalis ing criteria and  indicators for certification in line with the  Charte r    II.1 Methods for formalising indicators based on the Charter 's principles     In order to faithfully transpose the CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial  systems in a certification scheme, we need to design operational, objective and verifiable indicators based on  the five principles it sets out:   - Principle of respect for fundamental rights: ensure that the design and impl ementation of artificial  intelligence tools and services are compatible with fundamental rights.     43 VassilisPrevelakis and Diomidis Spinellis, "Sandboxing Application ", Proceedings of the USENIX Technical Annual  Conference, Freenix Track, June 2001, pp. 119 –126 (2001).   44 https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/regulatory -sandbox    45 For more general  information : Laura Delponte, "Study: European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an   integrated vision ", European Parliament, IPOL, 2018, 48 pages.   46 Cédric Villani, "For a meaningful artificial intelligence", Fr ench parliamentary mission, 2018, 233 pages.   47 https://www.tekoalyaika.fi/en/reports/finland -leading -the-way-into-the-age-of-artificial -intelligence/3 -eleven -key-actions ushering -finland -into-the-age-of-artificial -intelligence/   
12 - Principle of non -discrimination: specifically prevent the development or intensification of any  discrimination between individuals or groups of individuals.   - Principle of data quality and security: with regard to the processing of judicial decisions and data, use  certified sources and intangible data with models elaborated in a multi -disciplinary manner, in a secure  technological environment.   - Principle of transpa rency, impartiality and fairness: make data processing methods accessible and  understandable, authorise external audits.   - Principle “under user control”: preclude a prescriptive approach and ensure that users are informed  actors and in control of the choice s made.     II.2 Indicators for Principle no. 1: respect for fundamental rights     Principle no. 1 of the Charter: "Principle of respect for fundamental rights: ensure that the design and  implementation of artificial intelligence tools and services are compatible with fundamental rights"     The first principle on respect for fundamental rights is the most specific and certainly the most complex to  transpose into an artificial intelligence certification scheme. Among other things it hinges on the concept of   Human rights by design , which serves as the key strategy line of the CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the  use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems.     - Proportion ate processing of  person al data (priv acy) and clear purpose s  - Anonymisation of the  parties and particip ants (physi cal individual s) and their counsels   o Checking by  consultation of data sets   - Absence of evalu ation and class ification of  physi cal individuals or legal entities  on the  basis of judicial   decisions   o Checking by  consultation of the interface   - Anonymisation of the name of the  judge and the  location of the court in  decisions u sed for  predictive  justice ( with th e aim of avoiding  forum shopping )  o Checking by consultation of data sets   - Hermetic separation of  artificial intelligence services  having  different purpos es (such as  dissoci ating  the search engine  service from the  aid for decision -making  service)   o Checking of  databases and data sources used by each  system     - Right of access to the judge and the right to a fair trial   - Presence of clear information indicating, where applicable, th at a report generated by an artificial  intelligence system  is not explainable . This aspect allows the judge to maintain full control in his  decision -making and to use the reports not fully explicable, which can be generated by connectionist  artificial intelligences, only knowingly.   o Learning model and interface   - For aspects related to access to the judge , refer to indicators related to user control and more  specifically to the possibility of AI opt -out for the defendant (II.6)     - Judges’ independence in their decision -making process   - Safeguard against the profiling of judges   o A/B testing checking on the sear ch engine using different user accounts and different search  histories   - Match between the criterion displayed and the actual pattern of classification of search results   o Checking by auditing search results   - Transparency of weighting of criteria for multicri teria searches   o Checking of the existence of explanatory information and auditing of search results   - Transparency of criteria used for searches by "relevance"   o Checking of the existence of explanatory information and auditing of search results     - Ethics and Human rights by design   - Taking into account  of fundamental rights and freedoms and the ECHR  from the outset :  o for symbolic artificial intelligence systems   ▪ Report presenting the decision  trees  explaining how  fundamental rights and freedoms  are to be taken into account   o for conne ctionist artifici al intelligence  system s with supervis ed learning   ▪ Report presenting the  training data and methods,  explaining how  fundamental rights  and freedoms are to be taken into acc ount 
13 ▪ Assessment of the impact of the service using artificial intelligence in terms of  fundamental rights and freedoms : Absence of prior checking (accountability of the  actors )  ▪ Optional de signation of an  independent  artificial intelligence officer  where  explainability is adequate and mandatory designation where  explainability is  inadequate   o for conne ctionist artifici al intelligence  system s with unsupervis ed learning   ▪ Assessment of the impact of the  service u sing artificial intelligence in terms of   fundamental rights and freedoms : Absence of prior checking (accountability of the  actors )  ▪ Compulsory de signation o f an independent artificial intelligence  officer    - Installation of and continu ous permission  for access to a CEPEJ  human rights conformity plugin (m etaAI/plugin which could be  developed subsequently using the  information  obtained from impact   assessments;  such a  plugin could  potentially be used or adapt ed beyond the legal and judicia l  sphe res).    II.3 Indica tors for Principle no. 2: non -discrimination     Principle no. 2 of the Charter: "Principle of non -discrimination: specifically prevent the development or  intensification of any discrimination between individuals or groups of individuals"     The second  principle  is aimed at obviating  discrimination that c ould ari se in connection with sensi tive data . By  nature, a rtificial intelligence is dependent on the  creation of more or less finely drawn  categories, and therefore   discrimination. Limit ing discrimination  means curbing  artificial intelligence and removing sensitive data may  create  biases, which may be preferable or necessar y. The a nonymisation o r selective exclusion of certain  data  is a means of  limiting discrimination48. Some  research, such as that carried out by researchers at Eindhoven  Universit y of Technology suggest  solutions entailing the  reprocessing of data in order to eliminate  discriminato ry effects49 but, for the time being , these seem  very onerous and  difficult to deploy beyond an   experimental  environment . Some  sensi tive information, relating fo r example  to someone's state of health may  have the  effect of diminishing their respons ibility or constitu ting attenuating circumstances. N evertheless, to   effective ly avoid discrimination on base s that would be contra ry to human ri ghts and not exacerbate inequality ,  these data should be comprehensively taken into account b y inclu ding tags capa ble of indirect ly produ cing the  same  discriminato ry effects by cross -referencing (deducing a person's  origin  from their surname, de ducing  sexual orientation from context ual elements, deducing socio -economi c background from a home address etc).  It should also be  noted that the use of artificial intelligence may well give rise to new  heavily profiled and  category -unrelated forms of discrimination that are less readily discernible , such as  discrimination based on  ethni c background .    This principle  must be considered in  parallel to the stipulations of A rticle 6 of Convention 108+  regarding  special  categories of data, and A rticles 9 and 10 of the  GDPR also applicable  in many Council of Europe  member countries, which authorise  the processing of this type of data sol ely on condition that there are  suitable  safegua rds complementing the obligations applicable to classic personal data.      Among the exceptions granted under Article 9 of the GDPR are processing necessary for the establishment,  exercise or defence of legal claims and processing necessary for reasons of s ubstantial public interest, on the  basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued.     Article 10 of the GDPR puts forward a distinction as to the entity carrying out the processing of personal data  relating to criminal con victions and offences or related security measures, which may be processed only under  the control of official authority and in exceptional cases and with appropriate safeguards from other entities.     Article 6 of Convention 108+ expressly refers to the risk  of discrimination resulting from the processing of  sensitive data, which is also emphasised in the CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial  intelligence in judicial systems.        48 On this point, see for example: Salvatore Ruggieri,  "Data Anonymity Meets Non -Discrimination", IEEE 13th International  Conference on Data Mining Workshops (December 7 -10, 2013), pp. 875 –88.  49 See for example Faisal Kamiran and Calder Toon, "Data Preprocessing Techniques for Classification Witho ut  Discrimination ", Knowledge and Information Systems 33, no. 1 (December 3, 2011), pp. 1–33.   
14 - Avoiding discrimination based on sensitive data     On principle:    - Elimination of the tags that could be linked to parties' sensitive data (home address, income, family  situation, registered capital)   o Checking by consultation of data sets   o A/B testing using information and tags that could be linked to sensitive data by changing,  where applicable, one of the following parameters in each test: surname, home address,  income, family situation, registered capital, relevant specific contextual inf ormation   o Form enabling users to submit detailed requests for the removal of tags that could be linked  to sensitive data, with copy to the artificial intelligence officer, where applicable, and to the  control authority (labelling entity).     By way of excepti on, for artificial intelligence systems under public authority control and for data relating to  criminal convictions and offences or related security measures:   - Mechanisms guaranteeing that the processing is necessary and proportionate   o Impact assessment by the processing body explaining the safeguards implemented   o Designation of an artificial intelligence officer     II.4 Indicators for Principle no. 3: data quality and security     Principle no. 3 of the Charter: "Principle of quality and security: with regard to the processing of judicial  decisions and data, use certified sources and intangible data with models elaborated in a multi disciplinary manner, in a secure technological environment"     The previously mentioned  ISO/IEC 27001 standard  (see section  I.5 above ) represents, i n 2020 , the benchmark  for IT and data  security. Standard  ISO/IEC 27001 provides for a hundred or so  security me asures de signed to   control the solidity of a system in terms of  cybersecurity. Compliance with this  techni cal standard mig ht be  stipulated as a prerequisite for this  certification  scheme . In the area of  cybersecurity, using an  ISO/IEC   techni cal standard , designed chiefly by companies in the  sector, does not appear to pose any  structur al  difficulties as those companies seek to apply  the highest  standards in order to fulfil their  obligation  of result for  their customer s and comply with the relevant laws and binding  regulations. When  certification within the  meaning of A rticle 42 of the  GDPR is adopt ed in the are a of cybersecurity, it could be seen as a replacement  for the ISO/IEC standard .    Ensuring the  qualit y of data and that it does not undergo semantic alt eration50 up until integration in the  data  set provided for an  artificial  intelligence system  is an issue of fundamental importance, commonly designated  by the acronyms ALCOA51 and ALCOA+52, which stipulate that data  must  be attributable,  legible,   contemporaneous, original, accurate, complete, consistent,  enduring,  available.      One possible method of ensuring the integrity of the "d ata based on judicial decisions " referred to in the third   principle of the Charte r might be to create a  system enabling the competent  authorities  in member  States to  blockchain digitised judicial  decisions. However,  certification  scheme s, particul arly when mandatory, can in  some cases  create  indirect  obstacl es to applications coming onto the  market.    This third  principle also e vokes the multidisciplina ry aspect of designing or at the very least evaluating  artificial  intelligence models. Such an objective might be achieved by setting up a  group  of experts made up of  law  profession als, researche rs and academics from  disciplines including law , ICT science , math ematics, IT,  economi cs or  sociology. This group could provide the scientific structure for a mechanism for giving support  and guidance to promoters of artificial intelligence solutions in the legal and judicial sphere, particularly within  the framework of sandboxes (see  section  I.11 above).     II.5 Indicators for Principle  no. 4: transparency, impartiality and fairness     Principle  no. 4 of the Charter: “Principle of transparency, impartiality and fairness: make data  processing methods accessible and understandable, authorise external audits.”       50Semantic alteration  does not include, fo r example , the exclusion of sensi tive data, such as those whose removal has  previously been  envisag ed (see. II.3).   51 Acronym standing for: Attributable; Legible; Contemporaneous; Original; Accurate.   52 The "+" in ALCOA+ stands for: Complete  ; Consistent  ; Enduring  ; Available.  
15 - Access to source code for certification     The references cited in the Charter put this principle into perspective, particularly the Council of Europe ’s MSI Net study, the Villani report and the report by the House of Lords, which note with some resignation the  unlikelihood of securing the provision of entire algorithms or their source codes and merely entertain the  possibility of obtaining key subsets of information.53 In the case of optional certification (see I.1), which provides  for full disclosure of the source code as a condition for receiving certification,  the companies with the most  advanced algorithms may not wish to relinquish their competitive advantage even in return for certification that  is likely to reassure their customers.     In the case of mandatory certification, imposing obligatory source code access appears to be perfectly  feasible  but should be implemented with the utmost respect for trade secrets.     It would therefore be possible to consider the confidential transmission of entire source codes to the committee  awarding the certification or to the artificial intelligence o fficer, possibly after intuitu personae  approval by the  company in question.     Furthermore, state -controlled artificial intelligence applications that are designed in -house by public authorities  should be open source, in the same way as legal texts are acc essible to citizens, with the selection of artificial  intelligence designed by service providers and used by States conditional on it being open source.     For some types of artificial intelligence, source code access does not always suffice to ensure that i t is fully  explainable.     - FAT-ML: artificial intelligence that is fair, accountable and transparent      In the study of the behaviour of algorithms, there is some consensus for focusing on the fair, responsible and  transparent character of artificial intelligence; this approach is called FAT -ML (Fairness, Accountability and  Transparency in Machine Learning)54.    - Fairness   The issue of the fairness of artificial intelligence intersects with that of non -discrimination referred to in Principle   no. 2 of the Charter (see II. 3).     - Account ability for artificial intelligence   The criterion of account ability refers to the possibility of holding a natural or legal person liable in the event of  artificial intelligence malfunctioning or causing damage. Certification could potentially mean the legal entity  acting in good faith could be at least partly exon erated from liability  in the event of a problem arising from  certified artificial intelligence. The aforementioned sandbox method is designed to limit the damage, and  therefore the liability that may be incurred, through initial deployment of the applicati on in a controlled and  restricted environment during a testing phase.      - Transparency   Beyond access to code, transparency refers to the possibility of explaining the decisions of artificial intelligence  systems. This aspect of artificial intelligence is vital and has already been widely taken on board in the  indicators proposed for the firs t principle as a prerequisite of any ethical by design and human rights by design  system, which are distinguished according to the type of artificial intelligence — symbolic or connectionist (see  II.2).       53 The CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems,  page 11, footnote 3: “Of  interest in this connection is the suggestion made on page 38 of the Council of Europe’s MSI -NET study on ‘Algorithms  and Human Rights’: ‘The provision of entire algorithms or the underlying software code to the public is an unlik ely solution  in this context, as private companies regard their algorithm as key proprietary software that is protected. However, there  may be a possibility of demanding that key subsets of information about the algorithms be provided to the public, for  example which variables are in use, which goals the algorithms are being optimised for, the training data and average  values and standard deviations of the results produced, or the amount and type of data being processed by the algorithm.’”  Or even the sugge stions appearing on page 117 of the aforementioned “AI for Humanity” report drafted by Mr Cédric  Villani, a member of the French National Assembly, as part of a mission assigned to him by the Prime Minister of the  French Republic: “The auditors may be sati sfied with simply checking the fairness and equity of a programme (doing only  what is required of them), by submitting a variety of false input data, for example, or by creating a large quantity of syste m  user profiles according to precise guidelines.” In addition, there are also the statements in the report by the House of Lords,  “AI in the UK: ready, willing and able?”, paragraphs 92, 96 -99.  54 For more information, see the website: https://www.fatml.org/  
16 Symbolic artificial intelligence systems are determ inistic, rigid and explain able because they model human  thought processes with representations. Provision of the model is therefore all that is required to audit this type  of artificial intelligence.     Connectionist artificial intelligence systems may becom e harder to explain as they evolve and complexify. For  this type of artificial intelligence, a system of continuous monitoring conducted by an artificial intelligence officer  or an automatic verification plugin should be considered with a view to explainab ility. When a full explanation  cannot be provided, it must at least be possible for users accessing the result supplied by artificial intelligence  to be immediately aware that this is the case  (see I.2 and I.3).     With regard to transparency, the IEEE P7001™ Transparency of Autonomous Systems standard which is  currently under development should make it possible to integrate technical specifications with the aim of  reinforcing the protection of the principle of trans parency.     - Identifying artificial intelligence systems and their actions   The question of identification is crucial to ensuring the transparency and responsibility of actors involved in the  sector. Just as a user is indirectly identifiable when browsing and  communicating, it would be useful if this were  also the case for an artificial intelligence system, which has a certain autonomy in its actions. An AI system  should be explicitly identified as such on the network ( possibly with the indication of its categ ory, connectionist  or symbolic). Today, users can be indirectly identified on a network via their hardware ’s MAC address or to  some extent on the Internet via the IP address (if static) of the  network -connected  device. Enhanced user  identification tools ar e used for processes requiring secure identification (KYC systems, electronic signatures,  etc.).     Identifying artificial intelligence systems means that the information -gathering operations they perform can be  seen (they leave a readable trace) and their a ctions can be attributed to them. This aspect is crucial for complex  systems with composite artificial intelligence systems that may have been developed by different entities.     Identification or registration, solutions which are regularly proposed for connected objects, are generally  excluded from the debate on artificial intelligence because of the potential constraints  for industrial and defence  use, but this point is inherent to the effectiveness of a standard or certification based on ethics and  accountability of the actors involved.     Registering artificial intelligence systems and establishing a mandatory signature for their actions could form  part of the certification criter ia. This would permit the creation of a register of certified artificial intelligence  applications which could each be assigned  a unique signature. This could be based on the model of the IP  addresses allocated by ICANN ’s IANA for websites and code signing  tools could be adapted to such  applications. Using blockchain could amplify the register ’s transparency and strengthen its security, which  would in turn enhance user confidence.     II.6 Indicators for Principle  no. 5: under user control     Principle 5  no. of the Charter “ ‘Under user control ’: Preclude a prescriptive approach and ensure that  users are informed actors and in control of their choices.”     The principle of control by the different types of users goes hand in hand with explainability and the iss ue of  interfaces, particularly the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).     - Ensuring the system is under user control   By ensuring the system is under user control, the aim is to limit the impenetrability of the platform ’s functioning  by enabling th e user to understand and use all the available functionalities.     User control may be facilitated by:   - a helpline to provide access to relevant support   - an intuitive and ergonomic interface   - comprehensive and precise user guides   - short tutorials on how to use each functionality   - user training     As part of the certification process, for example at the end of the sandbox phase and depending on the  complexity of the platform and its interface, the certification body could recommend measures to be taken to  achieve the aim of ensuring the system is under user control with a view to obtaining certification. Tests 
17 involving  "average" users could be carried out to verify the effectiveness of the support systems by measuring  their ability to produce the desired result.     - AI opt -out for defendant   The Charter advocates clearly informing the defendant in the event of the use of artificial intelligence to  render a judicial decision and providing for the right  to object and request that the case be heard directly by a  court within the meaning of Article 6 of the ECHR.     - Clear information for the defendant on the use of artificial intelligence in his/her case   o Checking of the presence of an information banner mentioning the use of artificial intelligence  that must be clicked before accessing the service   - Defendant ’s right to opt out of the use of artificial intelligence   o Checking of the presence of a mechanism for expressing consent on the last line of the  information banner   o Checking of a notification system for the defendant ’s decision and for effective rerouting  to  conventional proceedings before a court within the meaning of Article 6 of the ECHR     - Training and certification of members of the judicia ry   In the event of a state body deploying an artificial intelligence solution to support judicial  decision -making with  a view to testing it before rollout, it would also be useful to certify members of the judiciary in addition to the  certification of the  platform as such. Such certification training could focus on understanding the functionalities  and the critical method to be adopted with regard to the proposals of artificial intelligence when drafting an  assisted judicial decision.     III. Certification a uthorities and methods     The main certification methods , depending on which authority is to be competent,  are as follows:    - Self-assessment by artificial intelligence publishers    - Assessment by CEPEJ or institute linked to the Council of Europe    - Assessment by approved bodies   - Continuous assessment by artificial intelligence plugin developed for or by the CEPEJ    - Mixed assessment capable of evolving     The choice of certification method and authority is partly driven by other aspects of certificati on. Criteria likely  to guide the choice of the preferred type of certification authority include: whether certification is mandatory or  optional, the desired degree of control, the economic profitability of the certification procedure or, conversely,  its loss-making nature, technical complexity, the existence of bodies with a proven track record of certifying  digital systems  according to ethical criteria, and the feasibility of automation.     III.1 Self -assessment by artificial intelligence publishers     The main advantage of self -assessment by artificial intelligence publishers and/or subcontractors is that it  enhances accountability. The self -assessment aspects discussed in this study are mainly inspired by the  methods implemented to ensure G DPR complianc e for personal data storage through impact assessments  and the use of independent experts. Such an approach helps to raise awareness among publishers and to  encourage continuous vigilance, but it does not seem sufficient in a field as sensitiv e as that of artificial  intelligence in the judicial sphere, especially when it comes to connectionist artificial intelligence systems.     Relying on self -assessment as the sole method of verifying artificial intelligence systems seems particularly  hard to reconcile with the demands of certification, particularly if the latter is mandatory.     III.2 Assessment by CEPEJ or institute linked to the Council of Europe     Having an assessment conducted by the CEPEJ or an institute linked to the Council of Europe that is dedicated  to granting certification could be an option. This model could be based on the method of awarding the certificate  of suitability to the monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia with the support of the Council of Europe ’s  European Directorate f or the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare (EDQM) and the European Pharmacopoeia  Commission set up for this purpose by the Council of Europe ’s Public Health Committee.     The conditions for awarding certification of suitability to the monographs of the Europ ean Pharmacopoeia are  laid down in Resolution AP -CSP (07) 1 of the Public Health Committee of the Council of Europe of 21 February  2007. This document sets out the scope, to whom the certificate is delivered and the procedure for granting 
18 the certificate ( submission of the dossier, acknowledgement of receipt, designation of assessors, assessment  procedures, notification of the decision, follow -up to the certification of suitability and reference documents).     The advantages of direct or near -direct certifica tion by the CEPEJ include the procedural framework conducive  to certification closely in keeping with  the spirit of the Charter ’s principles, the certification ’s increased range  of influence, closer management of the potential impact of lobbying by actors and companies involved the AI  sector, and the direct selection of the individuals  in charge of the assessments and the vetting of their  impartiality, integrity and competence. Direct or near -direct certification may also have greater legitimacy  justifying its mandatory nature.     Providing certification implies running costs, which are greater if the procedure is managed directly. By setting  a certification application fee that covers the procedural operating costs, however, it would  be possible to  cover  operating costs and even  turn a profit that could, for example, be assigned to improving regulatory control of  the use of artificial intelligence in  the judicial sphere , to developing a plugin for monitoring artificial intelligence  applications or to adapting the certification to other sectors in which artificial intelligence might  violate human  rights, particularly by exacerbating discrimination.     III.3 Assessment by a pproved bodies     Approved bodies or certificating bodies are organisations specifically authorised to independently ensure the  application of the specifications and procedure required for certification granted by a public agency.     They have significant expertise in conducting certification. Having approved bodies set up a certification  procedure may be quicker than a procedure being conducted by a public authority creating a specific entity for  this purpose. In addition, these bodies achieve an economy of scale for certification, thereby limiting procedural  costs and generating operating profits.     However, if optional certifications are entirely delegated to approved bodies, they may become less attractive  for entities wishing to obtain certif ication of renown for their product or service.      III.4 Continuous assessment by artificial intelligence plugin developed for or by the CEPEJ     As mentioned above (in sections I.3, II.2 and II.5), an artificial intelligence plugin developed to verify the  continuous compliance of systems using artificial intelligence in the judicial sphere could make it possible to  automate compliance monitoring, or even part of the assessment itself. A plugin of this kind could provide  support to artificial intelligence of ficers conducting compliance monitoring and possibly take on at least part of  their work. If it were developed, such a tool would generate development and maintenance costs and a  significant amount of time would be required to prove its effectiveness and t o gain sufficient hindsight on the  difficulties people had encountered during the certification procedure and monitoring process.     III.5 Mixed assessment capable of evolving     A mixed assessment capable of evolving could take advantage of the different bene fits mentioned for each of  the assessment methods and certifying bodies.     An initial self -assessment could therefore be carried out by the publisher applying for certification in the form  of the impact assessments referred to above (see II) and the subseq uent certification compliance monitoring  could be partly carried out by an artificial intelligence officer designated by the publisher.     A pragmatic option might also be to delegate a pre -certification procedure or the assessment of technical  aspects (mai nly transparency and the security of information systems) to the abovementioned approved bodies  in order, for example, to enable the CEPEJ or its partner organisation to focus its assessment on the aspects  strictly related to human rights by design and the  fight against discrimination in artificial intelligence solutions  in the judicial sphere.     Deploying an artificial intelligence plugin as a complementary tool could also be useful to limit the constraints  related to compliance monitoring following certifi cation. However, this tool can only be envisaged in a second  stage, as it should be designed on the basis of impact assessments and reports from artificial intelligence  officers.       
19 IV. Governance structure     IV.1 Governance models      The governance model of the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare could serve  as a source of inspiration in the event of the creation of a team responsible for the certification of artificial  intelligence applications in the judicial  sphere in the case, for example, of a partial agreement on this issue  within the Council of Europe55.    An organisation chart for a certification department for artificial intelligence in the judicial sphere could therefore  include four sections:   - New Doss ier Evaluation Section   - Certification Support Section   - Inspection Section   - Research, Development and Training Section     The New Dossier Evaluation Section would be responsible for processing the dossier for an initial certification  procedure, forwarding it to the Certification Support Section where appropriate , designating assessors, taking  decisions and sending notificatio ns of the decision to award or refuse certification.     The Certification Support Section could be divided into two, with one unit specifically responsible for  sandboxing and the other acting as a secretariat to support applicants drafting impact assessments  and  provide information during the certification procedure. The secretariat would also be the designated point of  contact for any approved bodies and partner institutions.     The Inspection Section could be split into three units. The first would be in char ge of dealing with the artificial  intelligence officers, the second responsible for compliance monitoring and reassessments and the third for  detecting security breaches and issuing alerts. The Inspection Section would be responsible for continuous  monitor ing and could decide whether to suspend or withdraw certification.     The Research, Development and Training Section could be composed of two units with one responsible for  research and development and the other for training. The Research and Development Unit could be subdivided  into two parts, with one in charge of automati on and the development of plugins to continuously monitor artificial  intelligence systems and the other responsible for coordination and scientific publishing in order to monitor the  latest developments, particularly in techniques for explaining artificial  intelligence. It would also be in charge  of conducting studies and looking at how to promote  the certification beyond the judicial sphere. The Training  Unit could be subdivided into two parts, with the first dedicated to the training and, if necessary, ce rtification of  members of the judiciary and the second to the training and, if necessary, certification of artificial intelligence  officers.     55 https://cs.coe.int/_layouts/15/orgchart/OrgChartCust_A.aspx?key=715&lcid=1033  
  IV.2 Possible organisation  chart for a certification department for judicial artificial intelligence     The organisation chart below is adapted from that of the Certification of Substances Department (DECP) of the European Directorat e for the Quality of Medicines and  Healthcare (EDQ M).      
21 V. Identification and assessment of risks and opportunities entailed in certification by  the CEPEJ     V.1 Competition risk and opportunities for cooperation with third -party certification projects     With the Charter and the certification project, the CEPEJ and the Council of Europe are leading a unique  endeavour in the specific field of ensuring  that artificial intelligence applications  in the judicial sphere  uphold human rights. In parallel, t he Ad hoc Committee on Artif icial Intelligence of the Council of Europe  (CAHAI) examine s the feasibility and potential elements of a legal framework for the development,  design and application of artificial intelligence, based on Council of Europe’s standards on human rights,  democracy and the rule of law.     In the area of the ethics of artifi cial intelligence, other institutions, especially UNESCO and the OECD  (see I.9), some Council of Europe member States such as Malta and Denmark (see I.7) and certification  bodies such as CEN -CENELEC and IEEE (see I.8) have established principles that are i n overall  alignment with those of the Charter and they are considering certifying artificial intelligence applications .    The CEN -CENELEC and IEE could be partners of the future certification  scheme , for example, in  defining technical security standards ada pted to the specific challenges of artificial intelligence in the  judicial sphere.     Institutional cooperation could be considered with other intergovernmental and international institutions,  such as UNESCO and the OECD, to examine how to propagate a human rights by design approach for  artificial intelligence beyond the judicial sphere.     A consultation process on the strategies and first steps towards artificial intelligence certification taken  by Council of Europe member States like Malta and Denmark could help to streamline proposals for  certification methods.     V.2 Obsolescence risk     The certification ’s obsolescence risk seems limited insofar as it is designed to consider technological  progress in general as well as the specific development of each certified artificial intelligence system.  The obsolescence risk is also limited because the typologies use d to define the indicators (symbolic and  connective artificial intelligence) are based on their structure and are therefore fixed.     However, the obsolescence risk cannot be ruled out, for example, in the event of radically new  technologies emerging or of notable advances in fields such as quantum computing, which are likely to  considerably increase the power and calculation methods for quantum machine learning (QML)56 and  drastically modify standards in the field of information system securi ty57.    V.3 Risk of non -alignment with expectations of actors traditionally involved in technical  standardisation     Technical standardisation like that of ISO operates largely on a model of consensus building between  companies at successive levels: through n ational (e.g. AFNOR, DIN, etc.), regional (e.g. CEN) and then  international (ISO) organisations.     The members of standards committees  in the digital sector are either managers of start-up companies  or small consulting firms or engineers seconded by large c ompanies or national subsidiaries of  multinational groups. The latter can pose a particular challenge to standard setting practices because  the same multinational group may be represented in several national committees (multi   56 See for example: Vedran  Dunjko, Hans Briegel, “Machine  learning & artificial intelligence in the quantum domain:  a review of recent progress”, Rep Prog Phys, 2018, 81(7):074001.   57 See for example: Dan Boneh, Mark Zhandry , “Secure signatures and chosen ciphertext security in a quantum  computing world” , Annual Cryptology Conference , pp. 361 -379, 2013; Marc  Kaplan, Gaëtan  Leurent ,  Anthony  Leverrier , María  Naya -Plasencia, “ Breaking Symmetric Cryptosystems Using  Quantum  Period Finding”,  In: Robshaw M., Katz J. (eds) Advances in Cryptology –CRYPTO 2016. Lectu re Notes in Computer Science, vol  9815. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.  
22 representativity). Standards c ommittees include very few legal professionals and very few academics.  Technical standardisation is generally presented as a bottom -up process reflecting the priorities  companies have identified in the field. The work of standards committees generally focu ses on  economically promising areas and interoperability issues. In the field of artificial intelligence, the relative  economic insignificance of the judicial sphere (see introduction) means it is not considered in the  discussions as a benchmark case. Cert ification resulting from the Charter therefore runs no risk of  coming into conflict with the standardisation projects already under way.     National organisations also generally include ministry representatives who regularly chair the committee  and sometimes  steer certain standardisation work towards the strategic issues of their ministry. For  example, in France, the AFNOR national committee on artificial intelligence is chaired by the Ministry of  Defence and part of the work is therefore oriented towards aut onomous weapons, governance and  digital territory strategy.     At the European level, CEN -CENELEC launched a focus group on artificial intelligence in April 2019 to  meet the standardisation needs identified by the European Commission58. The focus group explores  different sectors such as smart manufacturing, robotics, autonomous transportation, virtual reality,  health care, but applications in the judicial sphere  are only mentioned in connection with  the field of  artificial intelligence -assisted decision -making. Strengthening relations with CEN -CENELEC and the  presence, for example, of a CEPEJ representative as an observer, could make it possible to orient  certain standardisation work towards the issues linked to certification on the basis of the Charter.     It should also be noted that the planned certification on the basis of the Charter is only partially technical  and that the technical aspect focuses on ethics by design and human rights by design, in which may not  be entirely compatible with a consensus -building process dominated by commercial companies. While  cooperation on standardisation and certification work in this field could be established and serve a  purpose, it would seem that such cooperation would have to focus on the technical aspect. The fact  is  that the points of divergence between the protection of fundamental rights and the drive  for commercial  profitability seem to be critical impediments to cooperation on the standardisation of ethics by design.     V.4 Risk of being classified as barrier to  entry (WTO) and opportunities for ethical  reorientation of practices     The introduction of technical standards or certifications that are difficult to attain  or mandatory (see  above I.1) may act as a brake on  competition by making it difficult for new companies to enter the market,  particularly when the standard or certification is mandatory or semi -mandatory. The risk of the World  Trade Organisation (WTO) classifying such technical standards and certification s as a non -tariff barrier  to market entry should also be considered. In theory, this has to some extent been the case for the  Ecolabel scheme, although the certification ’s voluntary nature means a complaint against Ecolabels  before the WTO on this basis wo uld be unlikely to succeed59.    Beyond its voluntary nature, the certification ’s origin plays an important role in the analysis of the risk of  it being classified as a barrier to entry, which is less likely to be an issue for  certification issued by an  international or intergovernmental institution.     Furthermore, objective, neutral c ertification with a legitimate societal objective which seeks to ensure  the enforcement of human rights could help avoid socially irresponsible corporate strategies and  behaviour and promote ethical solutions designed with fundamental rights and freedoms i n mind.   Therefore, the risk of artificial intelligence certification in the judicial sphere granted by the Council of  Europe being classified as a barrier to market entry seems particularly low.        58 See press release: https://www.cencenelec.eu/news/articles/Pages/AR -2019 -001.aspx    59 Kirstian Bartenstein and Sophie Lavallée, “L’écolabel est -il un outil du protectionnisme ‘vert’?”, Les Cahiers de  droit, 2003, 44 (3), 361 –393; Sophie Lavallée and Kristin Barentsein, “La régulation et l'harmonisation internationale  des programmes d'écolabels sur l es produits et les services”, Revue internationale de droit économique 2004/1 (t.  XVIII, 1), pages 47 -77. 
23 V.5 Opportunities for the theoretical -practical development  and promotion of the human  rights by design approach     The notion of Human rights by design laid down in the first principle of the Charter, of which it is an  integral component , is meaningful and seems much more feasible than the widespread notion of ethics  by design. Human rights by design differ s from ethic s by design in that it is based on provisions, articles  to which methodological positivism can give real effectiveness.     The need to take into account human rights by design results from socio -technological factors. The  human rights by design method should  be considered as an extension to all the fundamental rights and  freedoms of the privacy by design approach which shapes regulations governing  the processing of  personal data. The “by design” approach is made necessary by the place occupied in our societie s by  digital devices and algorithms which apply  programming  rules to the letter , unlike judges, for example,  who at least implicitly take considerations of fairness  into account. The words of Jean Bodin, “law without  equity is like a body without a soul”60, take on new meaning today in the era of machines enforcing rules  with the precision which is their own. The method of human rights by design aims to ensure an  application has built -in safeguards against the inflexibility of machine rules producing effect s contrary to  fundamental rights and freedoms. The method adopted for enforcing human rights by design could be  inspired by the ways in which case -law contributions are integrated into codified legal texts. This  approach corresponds to the integration of t he aequitas cerebrina , cerebral or unwritten equity, into the  aequitas scripta , written equity, that which is formalised in the law, in accordance with the summa divisio ,  the basic distinction, of the glossators61. Equity is traditionally used as a correct ive mechanism, whereas  the human rights by design approach aims to remove the need for subsequent correction as much as  possible.     The human rights by design approach consists in anticipating dysfunctions that may appear in practice,  correcting certain biases, rebalancing and formalising exceptions to the rule in a detailed manner. Impact  assessments focusing on the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms are part of this human rights  by design approach, in that they aim to anticipate the r isks of implementation.     If successfully applied to artificial intelligence in the sphere of justice, the human rights by design  approach could be applied more widely to artificial intelligence systems used in other fields and could  also potentially be tes ted in legislative processes, after enactment of legislation, to limit the need for the  review of compatibility of domestic legislation with international conventions and treaties before courts  of law.     VI. Certification and responsibilities     At the CEPEJ -GT-QUAL meeting of 18 June 2020, it was considered that the accountability issues  related to awarding certification were not particularly specific to artificial intelligence certification in the  judicial sphere.     The generic liability issues can be broken down as follows:   - Placing responsibility on or removing responsibility from the creators of artificial intelligence in  the judicial sphere   - Institutional and moral responsibility of the CEPEJ and the Council of Europe in the event of  certificatio n of platforms with shortcomings   - Responsibility for refusal of certification     Some liability issues of a slightly less generic nature can be highlighted such as the responsibility for a  malfunction of the plugin deployed by the CEPEJ to certify artificial intelligence applications on a  continuous basis or the limitation of the CEPEJ ’s responsibility through the use of a third -party certifier  for strictly technical aspects, in particular those related to cybersecurity.       60 Jean Bodin , Les six livres de la République de Jean Bodin (Six Books of the Commonwealth) (1530 -1596).   61 See for example: “L'équité ou les équités ( Journées juridiques franco -libanaises, Paris, 3 -4 October 2002)”. In:  Revue internationale de droit comparé. Vol. 55 N°1, January -March 2003. pp. 214 -229. 
24 VI.1 Implications of and re sponsibility for a malfunction of the plugin deployed by the  CEPEJ     The option of deploying a plugin to continuously monitor artificial intelligence applications on legal and  judicial platforms would enable increased compliance with the Charter post-certif ication and could have  a potential impact beyond this sphere. Even if such a plugin were based, for example, on a symbolic  artificial intelligence system and transcribed the criteria resulting from impact assessments and reports  by artificial intelligence officers as a decision tree, malfunctions or security vulnerabilities could occur  and have a significant impact on the user ’s perception, particularly for legal professionals. If the plugin  malfunctioned and the monitored platform was no longer in complian ce even though it appeared to be  and was certified as such at the time, then a decision taken by judges using this tool would be  undermined, potentially significantly reducing confidence in the system and the certification process and  creating institutiona l tensions.     VI.2 Limiting responsibility through the use of a third -party certifier      The use of a third -party certifier (an approved body) to certify technical aspects, particularly those related  to computer security, prior to full certification might be  appropriate owing to the rapid pace of  development of cutting -edge  technology and in standards in this field. Such an approach would make it  possible to ensure the quality of the certification and to relieve any certification body set up within the  Counci l of Europe of ancillary tasks. It would also have the effect of limiting the direct responsibility of  the CEPEJ and the Council of Europe in the event of inadequate certification in particularly technically  complex areas that are not strictly within the s cope of their missions and the added value of human  rights certification by design.     VII. Points of convergence with the future European Union regulations on artificial  intelligence     The European Union, and the European Commission in particular, are both very active in the field of  artificial intelligence, whether it is by trying to make European companies competitive in the sector, by  financing them (for example through its Horizon pr ojects) or by setting the regulatory guidelines for  artificial intelligence systems that uphold European values.     The White Paper on "Artificial Intelligence — a European approach based on excellence and trust"62,  published in 2020, is one of the first legislative steps towards imposing an ethical framework on artificial  intelligence and the most notable. It follows on from a European Commission Communication entitled  "Building Trust and Confidence in Human Driven Artificial Intelligence"63 publish ed in 2019 and is linked  to the work of the High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG)64.     The European Commission ’s work proposes to regulate and impose a mandatory framework for "high risk" artificial intelligence applications, while o ther artificial intelligence systems can be used with a  certain degree of freedom and obtain optional certification by complying with various rules. An artificial  intelligence application must meet two cumulative criteria to be considered high -risk: its us e in a sector  of probable risk and the consequences of such use. In the first criterion, the use of artificial intelligence  in the “judiciary” is considered as a high -risk part of the public sector65. In the second criterion, the White  Paper specifically m entions “ uses of AI applications that produce legal or similarly significant effects for  the rights of an individual or a company”, which is the case, at least indirectly, for the large majority of  artificial intelligence applications in the judicial spher e given their very purpose.      The European Commission therefore advocates an objective, prior conformity assessment to ensure  compliance with mandatory requirements for high -risk artificial intelligence applications66. This approach    62 White Paper on Artificial Intelligence — A European approach to excellence and trust, COM(2020) 65 final.   63 Communication from the Commission to the European parliament, the Council, the European Economic and  Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, “Building trust in human -centric artificial intelligence”,  Brussels, COM(2019)168 final, 8 Apri l 2019.   64 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/high -level-expert -group -artificial -intelligence    65 White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust, COM(2020) 65 final, p.17,  footnote 50.  66 Ibid. p. 23.  
25 seems to be perfectly aligned with the CEPEJ ’s certification project which focuses on human rights by  design and the definition of objective certification indicators.     The modalities of conformity assessment described by the European Commission refer to existing  mech anisms such as CE marking67, without excluding new, proportionate, non -discriminatory,  transparent and objective mechanisms68. The main disadvantage of CE marking is that it is designed  for finished products and not for systems that are likely to evolve su ch as connectionist artificial  intelligence solutions. The CE marking mechanism, unless it is specifically adapted, lends itself rather  poorly to impact assessments, sandboxes, the mandatory  involvement of artificial intelligence officers  and the use of a real-time certification monitoring plugin. Furthermore, opting for  CE marking would have  the effect of giving approved bodies discretion in points that go beyond the strictly technical and affect  fundamental rights (see I.5 above).     Overall, the European C ommission ’s approach could converge with a mandatory  certification project,  which would be more appropriate than an optional certification project in the judicial sphere69.     In addition, it should be noted that the European Commission is also considering support for SMEs to  relieve the financial burden of applying for certification and seeking advice on compliance70. Such  support could be particularly appropriate for the implementation of sandboxes (see I.11).     VIII. Schedule and roadmap     VIII.1  Ramification with the "Checklist of Charter  principles in your processing"     Appendix IV to the CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial  systems includes a “Checklist for integrating the Charter ’s principles into your processing method”. The  checklist is based on self -evaluation of the degree of integration of each principle in the artificial  intelligence system.       (CEPEJ European Ethical Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial sy stems, Appendix IV,  “Checklist for integrating the Charter ’s principles into your processing method”, p 76)     67 Ibid. p.23 “The conformity assessments for high -risk AI applications should be part of the conformity assessment  mechanisms that already exist for a large number of products being placed on the EU’s internal market ”.  68 Ibid. p.23 “Where no such existing mechanisms can be relied on, similar mechanisms may need to be established,  drawing on best practice and  possible input of stakeholders and European standards organisations.  Any such new  mechanism should be proportionate and non -discriminatory and use transparent and objective criteria in  compliance with international obligations”.   69 Idem.   70 Idem.   
26   It is specified in Appendix IV that this checklist by no means equates to the issue of a label or certification.     This checklist could be integrated at the stage of the impact assessment by the actors involved,  upstream of the labelling process.     VIII.2 Defin ition of  initial deployment needs and milestones for the CEPEJ     To allow the deployment of the certification project, the creation of a  dedicated team within the  secretariat of the CEPEJ could be envisaged.     Initially, during a preliminary phase to the deployment of a certification, the necessary human resources  may be limited and focus on two objectives : on the one hand the deployment a nd institutional follow -up  and on the other hand the training and technical aspects.     For the deployment and the institutional follow -up, a coordinator assisted by a restricted team of one to  two persons, could be in charge of the progress of the certific ation project, of the internal liaison within  the CEPEJ and the Council of Europe and of the inter -institutional and public communication relating to  the certification project. The coordinator could be in charge of the follow -up of a call for expression of   interest and the consultation of governmental and non -governmental bodies, actors in the sector (legal  professionals, platform publishers and artificial intelligence developers) and the public.     The coordinator's profile should be specialized in internati onal and institutional relations, ideally with  experience in a certification body, an international organization focused on digital or experience in digital  law (IT lawyer, lawyer in a digital company ...). Assistants, juniors or interns, could have traini ng in  communication or public relations, ideally with prior experience in intergovernmental organizations  and/or digital communication agencies. Certain aspects of communication could be outsourced or could  be carried out using pre -existing CEPEJ resources .    For the training and technical aspects, a team could be composed of two complementary profiles: on  the one hand, a magistrate or teacher -researcher in digital law, in charge of developing a training system  for magistrates and delegates in artificial intelligence, and on the other hand, a standardization engineer  specialized in information systems, in charge of the technical follow -up of the certification project and  the technical aspects of the training. Academics and technical experts from  certification bodies could be  called upon from time to time to contribute to the work of the training and technical team.     In a second phase, once the deployment has been completed, additional human resources will be  required for each of the sections: evaluation of new files, support for certification, inspection. The team  already created dedicated to training could be maintained and possibly restructured to respond more  specifically to the needs identified. These additional recruitments could  be progressive, depending on  the number of applications for certification, which would allow an adjustment with the application fees  charged to applicants for certification.     Conclusion     By drawing up the Charter and seeking a framework or certification procedure to promote the  enforcement of fundamental rights and freedoms in artificial intelligence applications , the Council of  Europe is aligning its mission to raise awareness and ensure the protection of human rights with  technological progress by adapt ing to this change and shaping its development to respect societal  needs.     The use of artificial intelligence in the legal and judicial sphere represents an important societal  challenge, particularly in the field of algorithmic justice. While technological  advances may bring  improvements to the judicial system, facilitate the work of legal professionals and improve access to  justice and information for defendant s/litigants , increased vigilance is necessary in this sector which the  European Commission descri bes as a high -risk sector.     The creation of objective, neutral certification aimed at enforcing human rights by design would foster  the emergence of an ecosystem of artificial intelligence applications designed and deployed in a manner  that upholds fundame ntal rights and freedoms. In a high -risk sector, such as the judicial sphere, the 
27 mandatory  nature of certification appears to garner consensus, but its implementation should not impede   innovation.     The CEPEJ ’s certification initiative  is both unprecedente d from a sectoral point of view and convergent  with the work on ethics and artificial intelligence under way in other bodies and institutions such as  UNESCO and the OECD and responds to a need already expressed by several Council of Europe  member States. I t could also build on certain technical aspects of the standardisation groundwork being  carried out, for example, by CEN -CENELEC and IEE.     The certification of artificial intelligence systems in the judicial sphere would also make it possible to  support pr ivate and public projects and to establish standards that reach beyond Europe, justifying, for  example, the development of international mechanisms for the recognition and enforcement of foreign  decisions71 or arbitral awards72 made by or with the assistance of artificial intelligence.     A successful experience in certification of artificial intelligence in the judicial sphere, where ethical  considerations and fundamental rights and freedoms are essential, could serve as a useful  source of  inspiration for artificial intelligence certification in other fields.          71 For example, Regulation (EU) No  1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of  12 December  2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial  matters.   72 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement o f Foreign Arbitral Awards, New York, 1958.
