Ford,  Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, rhoffman@ihmc.usHUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING that the robot had complex perception and reasoning skills equivalent to a child and that robots were subservient to humans. Although the laws  were simple and few, the stories attempted to demonstrate just how diffi  cult they were to apply in various real-world situations. In most situations, although the robots usually behaved “logically,” they often failed to do the “right” thing, typically  because the particular context of application required subtle adjustments of judgment on the part of the robot (for example, determining which law took priority in a given situation, or what constituted helpful or harmful behavior). The three laws have been so successfully inculcated into the public consciousness through entertainment that they now appear to shape society’s expectations about how robots should act around  humans. For instance, the media frequently refer  to human–robot interaction in terms of the three laws. They’ve been the subject of serious blogs, events, and even scientifi  c publications. The Sin-gularity Institute organized an event and Web  site, “Three Laws Unsafe,” to try to counter public expectations of robots in the wake of the movie I, Robot . Both the philosophy 1 and AI2 communities have discussed ethical considerations of ro-bots in society using the three laws as a reference,  with a recent discussion in IEEE Intelligent Systems . 3 Even medical doctors have considered robotic surgery in the context of the three laws.4With few notable exceptions,5,6 t h e r e  h a s  b e e n   relatively little discussion of whether robots, now  or in the near future, will have suffi  cient perceptual and reasoning capabilities to actually follow  the laws. And there appears to be even less serious discussion as to whether the laws are actually vi-able as a framework for human–robot interaction, outside of cultural expectations. Following the defi  nitions in Moral Machines:  Teaching Robots Right from Wrong , 7 Asimov’s  laws are based on functional morality, which as-sumes that robots have suffi  cient agency and cognition to make moral decisions. Unlike many of  his successors, Asimov is less concerned with the details of robot design than in exploiting a clever literary device that lets him take advantage of the large gaps between aspiration and reality in robot  autonomy. He uses the situations as a foil to explore issues such as the ambiguity and cultural dependence of lan-•	 guage and behavior—for example, whether what appears to be cruel in the short run can actually become a kindness in the longer term;social utility—for instance, how different indi-•  viduals’ roles, capabilities, or backgrounds are  valuable in different ways with respect to each  other and to society; andthe limits of technology—for example, the im-•	 possibility of assuring timely, correct actions in all situations and the omnipresence of trade-offs. In short, in a variety of ways the stories test the lack of resilience in human–robot interactions. The assumption of functional morality, while ef-Since their codifi  cation in 1947 in the collection of short stories I, Robot , Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics have been a staple of science fi  ction.

July/August 2009 www.computer.org/intelligent  15fective for entertaining storytelling,  neglects operational morality. Oper ational morality links robot actions  and inactions to the decisions, as sumptions, analyses, and investments  of those who invent and make ro botic systems and of those who com mission, deploy, and handle robots in  operational contexts. No matter how  far the autonomy of robots ultimately advances, the important challenges of these accountability and liability link ages will remain. 8 This essay reviews the three laws  and briefly summarizes some of the practical shortcomings—and even  dangers—of each law for framing  human–robot relationships, includ ing reminders about what robots can’t do. We then propose an alter native, parallel set of laws based on  what humans and robots can real istically accomplish in the foresee able future as joint cognitive systems,  and their mutual accountability for  their actions from the perspectives of   human-centered design and human–  robot interaction. Applying Asimov’s   Laws to Today’s Robots When we try to apply Asimov’s laws to today’s robots, we immediately run into problems. Just as for Asi mov in his short stories, these prob lems arise from the complexities of situations where we would use ro bots, the limits of physical systems acting with limited resources in un certain changing situations, and the interplay between the different social roles as different agents pursue mul tiple goals.   First Law Asimov’s first law of robotics states, “A robot may not injure a human be ing or, through inaction, allow a hu man being to come to harm.” This law is already an anachronism given the military’s weaponization of ro bots, and discussions are now shifting to the question of whether weaponized robots can be “humane.” 9,10 Such  weaponization is no longer limited to situations in which humans remain in  the loop for control. The South Ko rean government has published vid eos on YouTube of robotic border-   security guards. Scenarios have been  proposed where it would be permis sible for a military robot to fire upon anything moving (presumably target ing humans) without direct human permission. 11 Even if current events hadn’t made  the law irrelevant, it’s moot because robots cannot infallibly recognize hu mans, perceive their intent, or reli ably interpret contextualized scenes. A quick review of the computer vi sion literature shows that scientists continue to struggle with many fun damental perceptual processes. Cur rent commercial security packages for recognizing the face of a person standing in a fixed position continue  to fall short of expectations in prac tice. Many robots that “recognize”  humans use indirect cues such as heat and motion, which only work in constrained contexts. These prob lems confirm Norbert Wiener’s warn ings about such failure possibilities. 8  Just as he envisioned many years ago, today’s robots are literal-minded agents—that is, they can’t tell if their world model is the world they’re   really in.  All this aside, the biggest problem  with the first law is that it views safety only in terms of the robot—that is, the robot is the responsible safety  agent in all matters of human–robot  interaction. While some speculate on what it would mean for a robot to be able to discharge this responsibility, there are serious practical, theoreti cal, social-cognitive, and legal limi tations. 8,12 For example, from a legal  perspective the robot is a product, so it’s not the responsible agent. Rather,  the robot’s owner or manufacturer is  liable for its actions. Unless robots are granted a person-equivalent sta tus, somewhat like corporations are now legally recognized as individual  entities, it’s difficult to imagine stan dard product liability law not apply ing to them. When a failure occurs,  violating Asimov’s first law, the hu man stakeholders affected by that failure will engage in the processes of causal attribution. Afterwards, they’ll see the robot as a device and will look for the person or group who  set up or instructed the device erro neously or who failed to supervise  (that is, stop) the robot before harm occurred. It’s still commonplace af ter accidents for manufacturers and  organizations to claim the result was  due only to human error, even when the system in question was operating autonomously. 8,13 Accountability is bound up with  the way we maintain our social re lationships. Human decision-making  always occurs in a context of expec tations that one might be called to  account for his or her decisions. Ex pectations for what’s considered an adequate explanation and the con sequences for people when their   explanation is judged inadequate are Asimov’s laws are based  on functional morality,  which assumes that  robots have sufficient  agency and cognition   to make moral decisions.

16  www.computer.org/intelligent  IEEE IN tEllIgENt syst EMscritical parts of accountability sys tems—a reciprocating cycle of being  prepared to provide an accounting for  one’s actions and being called by oth ers to provide an account. To be con sidered moral agents, robots would  have to be capable of participating personally in this reciprocating cycle  of accountability—an issue that, of  course, concerns more than any sin gle agent’s capabilities in isolation. Second Law Asimov’s second law of robotics states, “A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first  law.” Although the law itself takes no  stand on how humans would give or ders, Asimov’s robots relied on their understanding of verbal directives. Unfortunately, robust natural lan guage understanding still continues to lie just beyond the frontiers of today’s AI. 14 It’s true that, after decades of re search, computers can now construct words from phonemes with some con sistency—as improvements in voice dictation and call centers attest. Lan guage-understanding capabilities also work well for specific types of well-structured tasks. However, the goal  of meaningful machine participation  in open-ended conversational con texts remains elusive. Additionally, we must account for the fact that not all  directives are given verbally. Humans  use gestures and add affect through body posture, facial expressions, and motions for clarification and empha sis. Indeed, high-performance, expe rienced teams use highly pointed and coded forms of verbal and nonverbal communication in fluid, interdepen dent, and idiosyncratic ways. What’s more interesting about the  second law from a human–robot in teraction standpoint is that at its core, it almost captures the more important idea that intelligent robots should no -tice and take stock of humans (and that the people robots encounter or interact with can notice pertinent as pects of robots’ behavior). 15 F o r  e x ample, is it acceptable for a robot to merely not hit a person in a hospi tal hall, or should it conform to so cial convention and acknowledge the person in some way (“excuse me” or a nod of a camera pan-tilt)? Or if a robot operating in public places in cluded two-way communication de vices, could a bystander recognize  that the robot provided a means to  report a crime or a fire? Third Law  The third law states, “A robot must protect its own existence as long as  such protection does not conflict with  the first or second law.” Because to day’s robots are expensive, you’d think designers would be naturally motivated to incorporate some form  of the third law into their products.  For example, even the inexpensive iRobot Roomba detects stairs that could cause a fatal fall. Surprisingly, however, many expensive commercial  robots lack the means to fully protect  their owners’ investment. An extreme example of this is in  the design of robots for military ap plications or bomb squads. Such ro bots are designed to be teleoperated by a person who bears full responsi bility for all safety matters. Human-factors studies show that remote operators are immediately at a dis advantage, working through a me diated interface with a time delay.  Worse yet, remote operators are re quired to operate the robot through  poor human–computer interfaces and in contexts where the operator can be fatigued, overloaded, or under high  stress. As a result, when an abnormal  event occurs, they may be distracted or not fully engaged and thus might not respond adequately in time. The  result for a robot is akin to expecting  an astronaut on a planet’s surface to request and wait for permission from mission control to perform even sim ple reflexes such as ducking. What is puzzling about today’s lim ited attempts to conform to the third law is that there are well-established technological solutions for basic ro bot survival activities that work for  autonomous and human-controlled  robots. For instance, since the 1960s we’ve had technology to assure guarded motion, where the human drives the robot but onboard software  will not allow the robot to make po tentially dangerous moves (for exam ple, collide with obstacles or exceed  speed limits or boundaries) without  explicit orders (an implicit invocation  of the second law). By the late 1980s, guarded motion was encapsulated into tactical reactive behaviors, essen tially giving robots reflexes and tac tical authority. Perhaps the most im portant reason that guarded motion and reflexive behaviors haven’t been more widely deployed is that they re quire additional sensors, which would  add to the cost. This increase in cost  may not appear to be justified to cus tomers, who tend to be wildly over confident that trouble and complexi ties outside the bounds of expected  behavior rarely arise.The goal of   meaningful machine  participation in   open-ended conversational contexts  remains elusive.

July/August 2009 www.computer.org/intelligent  17The Alternative Three Laws  of Responsible Robotics To address the difficulties of apply ing Asimov’s three laws to the cur rent generation of robots while re specting the laws’ general intent, we  suggest the three laws of responsible robotics. Alternative First Law Our alternative to Asimov’s first law  is “A human may not deploy a ro bot without the human–robot work system meeting the highest legal and  professional standards of safety and  ethics.” Since robots are indeed sub ject to safety regulations and liability laws, the requirement of meeting legal standards for safety would seem selfevident. For instance, the medical-   device community has done extensive  research to validate robot sensing of scalpel pressures and tissue contact parameters, and it invests in failure  mode and effect analyses (consistent  with FDA medical-device standards). In contrast, mobile roboticists  have a somewhat infamous history of disregarding regulations. For ex ample, robot cars operating on pub lic roads, such as those used in the DARPA Urban Grand Challenge, are considered by US federal and state  transportation regulations as experi mental vehicles. Deploying such vehi cles requires voluminous and tedious  permission applications. Regrettably, the 1995 CMU “No Hands Across  America” team neglected to get all  appropriate permissions while driv ing autonomously from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles, and were stopped in Kansas. The US Federal Aviation Ad ministration makes a clear distinc tion between flying  unmanned aerial  vehicles as a hobby and flying them for R&D or commercial practices,  effectively slowing or stopping many  R&D efforts. In response to these difficulties, a culture preferring “for -giveness” to “permission” has grown up in some research groups. Such at titudes indicate a poor safety culture at universities that could, in turn,  propagate to government or industry.  On the positive side, the robot com petitions sponsored by the Associa tion for Unmanned Vehicle Systems Internationa l are noteworthy in their  insistence on having safe areas of op eration, clear emergency plans, and safety officers present. Meeting the minimal legal require ments is not enough—the alternative first law demands the highest profes sional ethics in robot deployment. A failure or accident involving a robot can effectively end an entire branch  of robotics research, even if the op erators aren’t legally culpable. Re sponsible communities should proac tively consider safety in the broadest sense, and funding agencies should  find ways to increase the priority and scope of research funding specifically aimed at relevant legal concerns. The highest professional ethics  should also be applied in product de velopment and testing. Autonomous robots have known vulnerabilities to problems stemming from interrupted wireless communications. Signal re ception is impossible to predict, yet robust “return to home if signal lost” and “stop movement if GPS lost” functionality hasn’t yet become an expected component of built-in robot behavior. This means robots are oper ating counter to reasonable and pru dent assumptions. Worse yet, when they’re operating experimentally, ro bots often encounter unanticipated factors that affect their control. Sim ply saying an unfortunate event was  unpredictable doesn’t relieve the de signers of responsibility. Even if a  specific disturbance is unpredictable in detail, the fact that there will be disturbances is virtually guaranteed,  and designing for resilience in the  face of these is fundamental. As a matter of professional com mon sense, robot design should start  with safety first, then add the inter esting software and hardware. Ro bots should carry “black boxes” or  recorders to show what they were doing when a disturbance occurred,  not only for the sake of an accident  investigation but also to trace the ro bots’ behavior in context to aid diag nosis and debugging. There should be a formal safety plan and checklists  for contingencies. These do not have  to be extensive and time consuming to be effective. A litmus test for de velopers might be “If a group of ex perts from the IEEE were to write  about your robot after an accident,  what would they say about system safety and your professionalism?” Fundamentally, the alternative first  law places responsibility for safety  and efficacy on humans within the larger social and environmental con text in which robots are developed, deployed, and operated. Alternative Second Law As an alternative to Asimov’s sec ond law, we propose the follow ing: “A robot must respond to hu mans as appropriate for their roles.” The capability to respond appropri ately— responsiveness —may be more  The fact that   there will be disturbances  is virtually guaranteed,  and designing for  resilience in the face   of these is fundamental.

For exam ple, a robot might be constrained to follow waypoints but will be expected to generate appropriate responses to people it encounters along the way.  Responsiveness depends on the social  environment, the kinds of people and their expectations that a robot might encounter in its work envelope. Rather  than assume the relationship is hier archical with the human as the supe rior and the robot as the subordinate  so that all communication is a type of order, the alternative second law  states that robots must be built so that  the interaction fits the relationships and roles of each member in a given environment. The relationship deter mines the degree to which a robot is  obligated to respond. It might ignore  a hacker completely. Orders exceeding the authority of the speaker might be disposed of politely (“please have your superior confirm your request”) or  with a warning (“interference with a  law enforcement robot may be a viola tion”). Note that defining “appropri ate response” may address concerns  about robots being abused. 16 The relationship also determines the  mode of the response. How the robot  signals or expresses itself should be  consistent with that relationship. Ca sual relationships might rely on natu ral language, whereas trained teams  performing specific tasks could coor dinate activities through other signals  such as body position and gestures. The requirement for responsive ness captures a new form of autonomy  (not as isolated action but the more  difficult behavior of engaging appro priately with others). However, devel oping robots’ capability for respon siveness requires a significant research  effort, particularly in how robots can  perceive and identify the different members, roles, and cues of a social  environment. Alternative Third Law Our third law is “A robot must be endowed with sufficient situated au tonomy to protect its own existence as long as such protection provides smooth transfer of control to other agents consistent with the first and second laws.” This law specifies that  a human–robot system should be able  to transition smoothly from whatever  degree of autonomy or roles the ro bots and humans were inhabiting to a  new control relationship given the na ture of the disruption, impasse, or op portunity encountered or anticipated.  When developers focus narrowly on the goal of isolated autonomy and fall  prey to overconfidence by underesti mating the potential for surprises to  occur, they tend to minimize the im portance of transfer of control. But bumpy transfers of control have been  noted as a basic difficulty in human  interaction with automation that can contribute to failures. 17 The alternative third law addresses  situated autonomy and smooth trans fer of control, both of which interact  with the prescriptions of the other  laws. To be consistent with the second law requires that humans in a given role might not always have complete control of the robot (for example, when conditions require very short reaction times, a pilot may not be al lowed to override some commands generated by algorithms that attempt to provide envelope protection  for  the aircraft). This in turn implies that an aspect of the design of roles is the  identification of classes of situations  that demand transfer of control, so that the exchange processes can be specified as part of roles. This is when the human takes control from the ro bot for a specialized aspect of the mis sion in anticipation of conditions that will challenge the limits of the robot’s capabilities, or in an emergency. De cades of human factors research on human out-of-the-loop control prob lems, handling of anomalies, cascades of disturbances, situation awareness, and autopilot/pilot transfer of control  can inform such designs. To be consistent with the first law  requires designers to explicitly ad dress what is the appropriate situated  autonomy (for example, identifying  when the robot is better informed or  more capable than the human owing to latency, sensing, and so on) and to provide mechanisms that permit smooth transfer of control. To disre gard the large body of literature on resilience and failure due to bumpy transfer of control would violate the designers’ ethical obligation. The alternative second and third  laws encourage some forms of in creased autonomy related to respon siveness and the ability to engage in various forms of smooth transfer  of control. To be able to engage in  these activities with people in vari ous roles, the robot will need more situated intelligence. The result is an irony that has been noted before: in creased capability for autonomy and authority leads to the need to partici pate in more sophisticated forms of coordinated activity. 8Increased capability   for autonomy and  authority leads to the  need to participate in  more sophisticated forms  of coordinated activity.

July/August 2009 www.computer.org/intelligent  19Discussion Our critique reveals that robots need  two key capabilities: responsiveness and smooth transfer of control. Our  proposed alternative laws remind ro botics researchers and developers of  their legal and professional responsi bilities. They suggest how people can conduct human–robot interaction re search safely, and they identify criti cal research questions. Table 1 places Asimov’s three laws  side by side with our three alternative  laws. Asimov’s laws assume functional  morality—that robots are capable of making (or are permitted to make) their own decisions—and ignore the legal and professional responsibility  of those who design and deploy them  (operational morality). More impor tantly for human–robot interaction, Asimov’s laws ignore the complexity and dynamics of relationships and re sponsibilities between robots and peo ple and how those relationships are expressed. In contrast, the alternative three laws emphasize responsibility and resilience, starting with enlight ened, safety-oriented designs (alter native first law), then adding respon siveness (alternative second law) and smooth transfer of control (alternative  third law). The alternative laws are designed  to be more feasible to implement than  Asimov’s laws given current technol ogy, although they also raise critical  questions for research. For example,  the alternative first law isn’t concerned with technology per se but with the need for robot developers to be aware of human systems design principles and to take responsibility proac tively for the consequences of errors and failures in human–robot systems.  Standard tools from the aerospace,  medical, and chemical manufacturing safety cultures, including training, formal processes, checklists, black boxes, and safety officers, can be ad opted. Network and physical security should be incorporated into robots, even during development. The alternative second and third  laws require new research directions for robotics to leverage and build on existing results in social cognition, cognitive engineering, and resilience engineering. The laws suggest that  the ability for robots to express re lationships and obligations through  social roles will be essential to all   human–robot interaction. For exam ple, work on entertainment robots  and social robots provides insights  about how robots can express emo tions or affect appropriate to people they encounter. The extensive litera ture from cognitive engineering on  transfer of control and general human  out-of-the-loop control problems can be redirected at robotic systems. The techniques for resilience engineering  are beginning to identify new control  architectures for distributed, multi echelon systems that include systems that include robots. The fundamental difference be tween Asimov’s laws, which focus on robots’ functional morality and full moral agency, and the alternative laws, which focus on system respon sibility and resilience, illustrates why  the robotics community should re sist public pressure to frame current  human–robot interaction in terms of Asimov’s laws. Asimov’s laws dis tract from capturing the diversity of  robotic missions and initiative. Un derstanding these diversities and  complexities is critical for designing the “right” interaction scheme for a  given domain. Ironically, Asimov’s laws really are  robot-centric because most of the ini tiative for safety and efficacy lies in  the robot as an autonomous agent.  The alternative laws are human-  centered because they take a systems approach. They emphasize that responsibility for the consequences •	 of robots’ successes and failures lies in the human groups that have a stake in the robots’ activities, andcapable robotic agents still exist in •	 a web of dynamic social and cogni tive relationships.  Ironically, meeting the requirements of the alternative laws leads to the  need for robots to be more capable  agents—that is, more responsive to others and better at interaction with others. We propose the alternative laws as  a way to stimulate debate about ro bots’ accountability when their ac tions can harm people or human   interests. We also hope that these Table 1. Asimov’s laws of robotics versus the alternative laws of responsible robotics Asimov’s laws Alternative laws 1 A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction,  allow a human being to come to harm.A human may not deploy a robot without the human–robot work system meeting the highest legal and professional standards of safety and ethics. 2 A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.A robot must respond to humans as appropriate for their roles. 3 A robot must protect its own existence as long as such  protection does not conflict with the first or second law.A robot must be endowed with sufficient situated autonomy to protect  its own existence as long as such protection provides smooth transfer  of control to other agents consistent the first and second laws.
