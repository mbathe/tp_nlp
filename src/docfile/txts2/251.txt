    iii   Foreword     Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain  are two of the most transformative and disruptive  technologies of our times. The ongoing transition towards a digital economy has undeniably been accelerated by the COVID -19 pandemic. These technologies will play a central role on the path towards  a susta inable and resilient recovery, and towards Europe’s technological sovereignty.     This report presents a compelling case for allocating more resources to increasing  Europe’s innovation  capacity. We must look beyond our immediate needs and think long term, taking a strategic and  visionary approach in which we ask ourselves: where do we want to be 10, 20, 30 years from now?   What type of innovations and technologies will prepare the way  for future generations?    All major economies in the world are racing to take the lead  in the development and deployment of AI  and blockchain technologies. Europe, despite its scientific excellence, is lagging behind , especially  on  the financing front, where w e only contribute  7% of annual global equity investments in these  technologies. We need to give our emerging startups more firepower to compete globally, and to instil investors with the  confidence and conviction needed to  back our future tech champions.    However, finance alone  is not enough. We also need to strengthen and connect our ecosystems further  so that we can  translate brilliant ideas into commercial value better and faster. Equally, we must pay  close attention to the challenges and risks associate d with AI and blockchain technologies, despite  their countless benefits and opportunities. The main risks lie in  the trustworthy, responsible and ethical  application  of AI and ensuring technologies will be developed and deployed in line with our European  values.     At the EIB Group, we fully unsderstand what is at stake  and are ready to provide financ ial and advisory  support to leverage on the opportunity offered by AI and blockchain while ensuring that the approach  is human -centric and inclusive . In close co llaboration with the European Commission, our colleagues  at the European Investment Fund (EIF) recently launched a successful €100 million pilot project for a dedicated AI and blockchain investment scheme, while the EIB has introduced  a €150 million co investment facility to finance  AI and blockchain projects alongside EIF -backed fund managers and  private sector investors. This report will further guide us in our efforts.    I would like to thank my colleagues at the European Commission for their excellent co llaboration with  our Innovation Finance Advisory team. I am looking forward to continuing our close cooperation to  boost Europe’s performance in AI and blockchain for the benefit of our economy, our people and  society at large .

iv Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe       
   Executive summary  1 Executive summary     Introduction       Artificial intelligence and blockchain defined    The High- Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission defines  artificial intelligence (AI)  as “systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their  environment and taking actions –  with some degree of autonomy –  to achieve specific goals.”1 AIbased systems can be purely software -based, acting in the virtual world (such as voice assist ants,  image analysis software, search engines, and speech and face recognition systems), or embedded  in hardware devices (such as advanced robots, autonomous cars, drones or internet of things  applications). Blockchain  is defined as “a technology that allo ws people and organisations to reach  agreement on and permanently record  transactions and information in a transparent way without  a central authority.”2 The potential of blockchain technologies goes well beyond cryptocurrencies  and financial applications,  and use cases outside the financial sector are growing in number.     Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain are two of the most significant disruptive technologies of  our time, set to have a major impact on future societies and economies.  As transvers al technologies,  AI and blockchain can potentially disrupt a wide range of sectors and will likely play central roles in the success of Europe’s green and digital transitions, and in strengthening its technological sovereignty.  Regions lagging behind in th e AI race will probably see diminished global market shares in several  industries, from finance and e -commerce to manufacturing and mining. Investments in AI research and  development (R&D) are also crucial for security and defence, so underinvestment could  undermine  Europe’s national security.3 AI is expected to have a significant impact on progress towards achieving  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially on the  climate4 but also on diversity and  inclusion, and notably “gender smart” technological development. Both AI and blockchain have their  own degree of complexity, but their development can be mutually reinforcing, for example on the  integration of machine learning (ML).   In 2019 it was estimated that global gross domestic product (GDP) could increase by up to 14% (the  equivalent of €13.3  trillion) by 2030 because of the accelerating development and take -up of AI.5  Blockchain was also forecast to have a wide -reaching impact on GDP by 2025.6 Both of these  techn ologies can drive digitalisation across virtually all economic sectors. In addition, researchers and  practitioners alike envisage increasing disruptions from the convergence of AI and blockchain, laying the groundwork for a fully digital economy. Their int egration with the system of internet connectivity  across devices (internet of things, IoT) can lead to even greater opportunities. While this convergence is only just beginning, it has already started within large corporates and is showing powerful use cas es. 7                                                              1 A definition of artificial intelligence: Main capabilities and scientific disciplines , High -Level Expert Group on Artificial  Intelligence, 8 April 2019 ( link, accessed 6 April 2020).   2 Shaping Europe’s digital future.

2 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Global equity investments in AI and blockchain technologies amounted to €80 –85 billion8 between  2010 and 2019 (annual growth rate of 38%9). The COVID -19 crisis may have a negative short -term  impact on access to finance for AI and blockchain technologies (for example, on availability of capital  and on valuations). However, the current situation is also expected to generate positive commercial  momentum for these technologies due to their potential to accelerate digitalisation and reinvent the key sectors  hit hard by the crisis, such as financial services, healthcare and business intelligence. AI and  blockchain technologies can increase the resilience of the EU economy. For example, in light of the COVID -19 pandemic, AI can significantly help to accelerate  drug discovery processes or facilitate the  crucial sharing of information from clinical trials and insights on how the disease develops. Meanwhile,  blockchain technologies provide a remarkably transparent and decentralised way of recording lists of  transactions, which can facilitate anything from the sharing economy to smart contracts and supply chain management, the latter having proven notably vulnerable during the pandemic.   All major world economies, including the European Union, are racing to achieve a  leading global  position in the development and deployment of AI and blockchain.  The European Commission has  taken several measures to advance these technologies: the Horizon 2020 programme allocated €1.5  billion to AI in 2018 –2020; the Digital Europe Prog ramme, as part of the 2021 –2027 Multiannual  Financial Framework (MFF), will complement this by dedicating an additional €2.5  billion to investing  in and opening up the use of AI by businesses and public administrations.   On the investment front, the Europea n Investment Bank (EIB) launched a €150  million co -investment  facility to invest alongside fund managers and private investors backed by the European Investment Fund (EIF), while the EIF recently launched a pilot for a dedicated AI and blockchain investmen t scheme  of €100  million. Beyond such dedicated funds, the European Commission has made additional  resources available under the new Multiannual Financial Framework and the post -pandemic  NextGenerationEU programme, particularly the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), which will be  deployed with particular attention to strategic technologies. 10  These EU -wide initiatives are complemented by actions at Member State level, such as in France,  Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. These measures are helping to c atalyse broad -based AI and  blockchain expertise in the European Union, which now has more specialised AI researchers ( ~40 000)  than the United States ( ~30 000) and China ( ~20 000). The European Union also contributed to 30% of  the global AI research public ations in 2013 –2017.11  Companies and governments in Europe are substantially underinvesting in AI and blockchain compared to other leading regions, and it has become clear that the European Union struggles to translate its scientific excellence into busines s application and economic success.  Compared to other  major economic systems, there are no fundamental structural differences in the economy of the European Union that could justify lower business demand to deploy these technologies and take up  digital transformation. 12 However, the United States and China together account for over 80% of the  €25 billion of annual equity investments in AI and blockchain technologies, while the EU27 only  accounts for 7% of this global amount, investing around €1.75 billion.13 Europe’s venture capital  ecosystem seems to mainly provide early -stage finance for AI/blockchain -based small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) (10% of total venture capital investments in the European Union, versus 5%                                                              8 All currency figures in this report are converted acco rding to annual averages of the corresponding year, presented in  euro.   9 Preqin data, Oliver Wyman analysis.   10 MFF Factsheets.

   Executive summary  3 in the United States14,15), but clearly underperforms in subsequent rounds of financing (expansion and  growth stages).   Triangulating various methodologies, this study estimates a total investment gap in AI and  blockchain technologies in the European Union of about €5 –10 billion per year. This gap appears: (i)  to consist for the most part of equity investments –  as compared to debt; (ii) to be dominated by AI  (~80%) – as compared to a gap in blockchain investments; and (iii) to be more prominent in the later  stages of financing, such as Series A  onwards – as compared to the seed stage.16 Although the  pandemic’s long- term commercial impact on these technologies is expected to be positive, access to  finance may become more challenging in the short run as a result of market conditions, potentially  widening the investment gap. EU and Member State support schemes could plug part of the gap, but  private markets will clearly need to contribute the balance.     Study approach    The study comprised three steps:   • Step 1: The study analyses the global AI and blockchain landscape based on EIB and Oliver  Wyman’s  experience and expertise in the sector, as well as on other existing research,  market analyses, published reports and expertise in the sector. Based on proprietary  databases, the study benchmark s the Eur opean Union with other international geographies  and estimates  a range for the equity and debt investment gap for the two technologies,  respectively.   • Step 2: The researchers surveyed over 100 AI and blockchain small and medium -sized    enterprises (SMEs) loc ated in the 27 Member States and conducted in -depth interviews with  18 of those SMEs, as well as 19 financial market participants (including venture capital funds,  corporate venture capital funds, private equity firms, banks, national promotional banks and   innovation agencies). The aim is  to identify potential market failures and access -to-finance  barriers.   • Step 3. The study presents a set of recommendations targeting the key market failures and  barriers identified in the previous steps, supported by a high -level cost –benefit  analysis and  a high -level action plan for implementing these recommendations.                                                                        14 Preqin data, Oliver Wyman analysis .  15 European small business finance outlook , EIF, 2019, p. 51.   16 Preqin data, Oliver Wyman analysis.  
4 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Bottlenecks in AI and blockchain financing   The analysis, survey and interviews have identified several bottlenecks constraining access to  finance for AI and blockchain companies in Europe.  These are shown in Figure 1.   The study looked at the demand and supply sides. On the demand side, it is critic al that SMEs  have the  right talent to push innovation and produce high -quality R&D, and can scale up their products in a  unified digital market. On the supply side, venture capital investors, banks and other financial providers need to have sufficient avai lable capital to invest, the right tools to assess complicated technologies,  and the willingness to invest in them. Between supply and demand, the study also examined the  market matching system, which brings together SMEs and investors  to the benefit of al l parties. Finally,  the study analysed the overall innovation ecosystem and its value chain, in which all players need to cooperate in a coordinated manner, with government initiatives having a central role in defining  strategy, and prioritising and enabling the cooperation of such key players.   Figure 1: Framework for the analysis of AI and blockchain access -to-finance conditions       The highlighted dimensions of the framework include the key findings of the analysis.   Table 1: Bottlenecks in AI and blockchain financing                                                               17 Preqin data, Oliver Wyman analysis.   Element  Bottleneck  Description   Supply side  1. Volume  Limited availability of venture capital and private investments   Despite a tenfold increase in AI and blockchain investments in  Europe from 2016 to 2019, the overall availability of venture  capital funding remains a key issue for Europe.  In 2019, for  example, the funding volume provided by the EU27 venture capital  market to AI and blockchain SMEs  (€1.75 billion) was  considerably  smaller than the equivalent volumes in the United States  (€16 billion) and China (€4  billion).17 According to the interviewees,  this might be explained by European venture capitalists being  mostly financed by government agencies, family office s and  corporate investors, whereas large institutional investors – which  can typically deploy larger cheques particularly relevant for later  business life -cycle stages – only account for about 14% of the 
   Executive summary  5                                                             18 European small business finance outlook , EIF, 2019, p. 41; The state of European tech 2017 , Atomico, 2017.   19 The st ate of European tech 2019 , Atomico, 2019.   20 Who is winning the AI race: China, the EU or the United States?

In the United States, by con trast, large  institutional investors such as pension funds and university  endowments account for around 35% of the venture capital  market.18    Corporate investors play an important role as sources of capital in  the European venture capital system, but only a  limited role in the  global acquisition landscape. In 2019, corporate venture capitalbacked funding to AI startups reached an all -time high of  €9.5  billion globally (+70% vs. 2018),19 of which the European Union  accounted for around 7 –8%. More generally, l arge EU corporates  contributed about 17% of total venture capital funds (vs. 5% in the  United States). However, they play a limited role in the acquisition  of AI and blockchain companies, which is preventing the European  Union somewhat from achieving high independence from non -EU  investors. In particular, after the initial financing stages, several  Europe -born AI and blockchain companies have been acquired by  non-EU investors (for example, UiPath and DeepMind). From 2000  to 2019 there were 526 acquisitions of AI companies in the United  States but only 139 in the European Union (including the United  Kingdom). Similarly, during the same period, all of the top ten  companies by number of global AI acquisitions were US -based,  including Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft,  Amazon and Facebook.20    Another factor that could explain the low exit opportunities for AI  and blockchain investments in the European Union is the limited  value of tech initial public offerings (IPOs). In 2019 the United  States was the leading country for  “Computer & Electronics” IPOs  (note that three IPOs accounted for over 50% of the total: Uber,  Pinterest and Lyft); China ranked second and the EU27 third –  with  a value less than one -quarter of the US value.21    2. Specialisation  Limited specialisation of EU venture capital funds in AI and  blockchain   Compared to the United States, the European Union has fewer  venture capital investors specialising in AI and blockchain.  Several  such investors have emerged in recent years, with US  blockchain funds including Paradigm, Andreessen Horowitz,  Polychain, Pantera Capital and many others raising a combined  total of more than €1.8  billion between 2010 and 2019 –  more  than four times the total of blockchain equity investments in the  EU27. US -based venture capital funds are typically equipped with  highly experienced engineering teams, which support due  diligence and provide portfolio companies with relevant technical  support to develop and scale up their products. AI/blockchain  specialist funds  are far less common in Europe; those that do exist 
6 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe                                                              22 EIF VC Survey 2019.   23 Preqin data, Crunchbase data, Oliver Wyman analysis.  24 Responses to question: “What could be possible solutions to improve your access to finance?” (select up to three answers)  tend to be much smaller compared to their US peers and do not  always have the required capability for in -house technical due  diligence (17 –18% of surveyed SMEs  reported this as a key  constraint on access to finance in 2019 and 2020).     3. Willingness  Limited appetite for investments in AI and especially  blockchain  due to high upfront investment needs and the lack of knowledge  and low visibility of commercial applications   While AI is central to many European funds’ investment  strategies, the same amount of funding is not available to  blockchain initiatives.  According to the EIF VC (venture capital)   Survey 2019 , while 76% of respondents already had at least one AI  company in  their portfolio, only 23% had a portfolio including a  blockchain company. Nevertheless, 51% considered it likely or  highly likely that they would invest in blockchain in the future  (compared to 87% for AI).22 For blockchain there is an estimated  annual equ ity investment gap of €1 –2 billion, against an annual  investment of €0.1  billion in 2019.23 Limited appetite for  blockchain is notably attributable to lack of knowledge,  particularly the misconception that “blockchain is Bitcoin.”  However, as the technology  matures and its commercial viability  improves, investments are likely to follow.     Despite the perceived importance of AI technologies, investors  might still refrain from investing for three reasons: (i) the  business model requires higher upfront investmen ts in R&D; (ii)  cash flows and commercial traction occur after early adopters  have tested the technologies; and (iii) AI technologies need to be  incorporated into ready -to-use products or services with direct  applicability, which takes time.     Market  infra structure  4. Awareness and distribution Limited matching between SMEs  and investors   SMEs  are struggling to connect with investors, especially in the  early stages when investments tend to be more concentrated in  local markets.  In the market consultation, 30% of respondents  reported struggling to find the right investors in 2019, while 25%  said they would benefit from initiatives that help match small  firms and investors across the European Union.24 Furthermore,  limited matching troubles companies developing horizontal, core  technologies and those addressing a need in a specific “vertical”  area, whether a business function or within a specific sector.

The Eur opean Union has the largest talent pool of AI researchers,  numbering around 40  000, compared to some 30 000 in the  United States and 20  000 in China.25 Europe has also been leading  in the publication of AI -related research over the last two decades,  although China recently surpassed it in this field.     However, the EU27 is notably lagging behind its peers in R&D  spending. In terms of recent growth in investments, EU -based  companies are being outpaced by their US and Chinese  counterparts. Using R&D spending by  software and computer  services firms as an indicator for corporate R&D spending on AI  and blockchain, 62 of the top 100 firms are in the United States  whereas only 13 are in Europe.26 In 2019, the total amount of R&D  spending by software and computer servi ces firms among the  global top 2  500 (by R&D spending) reached €70  billion in the  United States, compared to €9  billion in Europe.27 Similarly, the  top ten companies granted the most patents in AI technologies  contained no European representative28 – despite  Europe’s strong  science base.     6. Digital market  While Europe's domestic market is comparable in size (GDP) to  those of the United States and China, the incompleteness of the  EU single market is hampering the scale -up of AI and blockchain  SMEs , hence limiting their ability to compete in the global  market.  US tech companies can benefit from a large, fully  integrated domestic market. The same applies to Chinese  companies, which can also benefit from partial protection against  foreign competition, allowin g them to scale up. This is not possible  for European companies that need to operate across several, not  fully integrated markets. Beyond the most common areas where  the lack of a fully fledged single market can disadvantage  European companies (for example  language barriers), two specific  areas are particularly relevant for AI and blockchain players: data  and regulation.     Limited availability of data   As stated in the European strategy for data,29 a small number of  non-EU big tech firms hold a large part of the world’s data, which  could reduce the incentives for data -driven businesses to  emerge, grow and innovate in the European Union.  Datasets are  key for AI firms to train their models, grow and compete in the  global market. Large amounts of data help compan ies develop  accurate models to recognise patterns in large databases and 
8 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe                                                              30 On 21 April 2021, the European Commission launched a proposal on new rules and actions for excellence and trust in  Artificial Intelligence, including Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificia l  Intelligence Act); Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence 2021 Review; and Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on machinery product  (link). perform several tasks. Firms and countries with access to vast  datasets have a competitive advantage in the development and  deployment of AI -based solutions. In the United States the  collection and management of data are left to the private sector,  with a considerable concentration in a few b ig techs. China has a  combination of government surveillance and the strong control of  big tech companies over massive amounts of data. In the  European Union, the lack of a fully integrated digital market  significantly constrains the creation of large, cross -country  datasets. This, in turn, limits the access of AI firms to large pools  of data for building and testing their algorithms, while the need  to  work in parallel on various national- based datasets increases their  costs. Overall, this reduces European AI firms’ competitiveness vis à-vis Chinese or American players.     Evolving regulatory landscape   To mitigate the risks of using AI and blockchain, the European  regulatory landscape has evolved quickly, creating several  challenges. Since 2014, the European Union has implemented  several regulations to facilitate and regulate the development of  data -intensive industries such as AI and blockchain. Regula tory  involvement is set to increase further as AI and blockchain are  increasingly deployed in “high -risk” areas (such as transport,  healthcare, defence and public services), which require clear rules  on safety, legal liability and rights protection. Member States are  currently highlighting the absence of a common European  framework. It is crucial to have common EU standards to avoid  cross -border uncertainties and the potential for arbitrage by  innovators in the field of data- driven technologies. Any regulat ions  should be limited to clearly identified problems for which feasible  solutions exist. Using a risk -based approach should help prioritise  regulatory focus and avoid overburdening AI developers and  service providers. In practice, however, it might be dif ficult to set  clear boundaries for what should be considered higher or lower  risk. As a major step in this regard, in April 2021, the European  Commission laid out proposals30 for new rules and actions that  aim to turn Europe into the global hub for trustworthy AI. The  efforts include the first -ever legal framework on AI and a new  Coordinated Plan with Member States that will guarantee the  safety and fundamental rights of peopl e and businesses, at the  same time strengthening AI uptake, investment and innovation  across the European Union. This will be complemented by new  rules on machinery that will adapt safety rules to increase trust in  the new, versatile generation of products .   
   Executive summary  9                                                             31 On 19 February 2020, the European Commission published an ambitious package on the European Union’s digital policy,  containing  a series of documents including the White paper on artificial intelligence –  A European approach to excellence  and trus t, the European strategy for data , and Shaping Europe’s digital future.   32 Crunchbase data, Oliver Wyman analysis.   33 Preqin data, Oliver Wyman analysis.  Innovation  ecosystem  7. Ecosystem  Fragmented innovation ecosystem   Economies of scale derived from concentration, integration and  proximity of talent and financing are the foundations for  successful experiences of innovation ecosystems like Silicon  Valley. As recognised in the European Commission White paper on  artificial intelligence ,31 efforts at European, national and regional  level should be coordinated to create an ecosystem of excellence  along the entire innovation value chain. This means creating  connected, specialised innovation clusters with universities,  startups, large corporates, investors, the public sector and all  other stakeholders located in close proximity and fully  cooperating. While the white paper focuses on AI, the same  arguments could  be advanced for blockchain.     The European landscape currently features several noninterconnected and non- specialised AI and blockchain  innovation centres. Four countries are home to 55% of all  European AI and blockchain SMEs  (Germany, France, Spain and  the Netherlands). A further eight Member States have above 40  AI/blockchain small firms each, while the remaining have  just a  few. At city level, the top ten EU cities account for over 40% of all  AI and blockchain small busines ses; however, there is substantial  dispersion in other smaller centres within each country.32  On the investment side, Germany and France account for about  70% of the total amount invested by European venture capitalists  in AI and blockchain since 2010. Othe r prominent AI and  blockchain centres do not receive investments in proportion to the number of SMEs  they have. 33 Similarly, despite the large amount  of technology -related academic research in some EU countries (for  example Italy, Spain and Poland), relativ ely few of these projects  attract venture capital investments. This is to some extent  explained by the maturity levels of local ecosystems (some are  mature and visible, others still emerging) and information  asymmetries, amplified by the overall lower leve ls of venture  capital and startup financing in Europe compared to other leading  regions.     The lack of integration can also affect innovation programmes  and initiatives promoted by the public sector, leading to  fragmentation of resources across countries an d technologies,  which hampers scaling up and developing big champions in  strategic fields for Europe.  While there are EU -wide coordinated  plans for AI and blockchain, Member States are concurrently  pursuing their own strategies, posing a risk of dispersing European  resources and creating inefficiencies. Public and private resources 
10 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe                                                                   34 EU13 refers to the 13 countries that have joined the European Union since 2004: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic,  Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.   35 See recent study by the EIB Innovation Finance Advisory, Financing the digitalisation of small and medium -sized  enterprises - The enabling role of digital innovation hubs . are not sufficiently channelled into creating big champions and  investing in them throughout all life -cycle stages (for AI and  blockchain in particular, fast scaling is the key t o success and a  major competitive advantage).     Despite a broad range of financing schemes available to tech  companies at the EU and Member State level, EU initiatives are  struggling to reach Eastern and Southern European countries .  None of the EU13 countri es34 are in the EU top ten in terms of  venture capital investments, even though some (such as Poland  and Estonia) have several AI and blockchain SMEs . The Central,  Eastern and South -Eastern European (CESEE) region is lagging far  behind the EU averages for s tartup and unicorn emergence and  small business digitalisation.35 Aiming to boost digital innovations  and the scale -up of digital startups in this region, the European  Commission, EIB Group, European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development and World Bank re cently launched the Digital  Innovation and Scale -up Initiative. This initiative is still in its early  days, and much hinges on its design and implementation, which is  still to be concretised. Yet such initiatives could provide an  important boost to the reg ion’s innovation ecosystem.    
   Executive summary  11 Recommendations   The study identified three major areas needing improvement in Europe’s AI and blockchain  landscape.  The bottlenecks in financing AI and blockchain  require a strategic and comprehensive  public -private response. The challenges identified span the development of AI and blockchain  technologies, their deployment in the market, and the wider EU innovation ecosystem. Accordingly,  the study makes several re commendations for addressing the three key objectives:   1. Development:  Boost financing for AI and blockchain development and scale -up  2. Deployment: Support take -up of AI and blockchain technologies in the market   3. EU innovation ecosystem: Develop a European integrated innovation ecosystem     The recommendations for each of these objectives are outlined in Figure 2 and discussed in more detail  in the remainder of this summary.   Figure 2: Mapping of recommendations to k ey identified objectives        
12 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Objective  Recommendation   Boost financing  for AI and  blockchain  development  and scale -up A. Intensify fundraising for the AI/blockchain investment scheme with  institutional investors, corporates, family offices and national promotional  banks, and carve out funds for growth- stage venture capitalists   • The EIF could, within its capacity, leverage its visibility in the European  venture capital space and its track record to focus fundraising for the  dedicated AI/blockchain investment scheme among private institutional  investors, large corporates and family offices. This could be done via an investment structure aimed at optimising the trade- off  for participating  parties with a lower risk -return profile, for example through a dedicated  fund -of-funds and/or downside guarantee mechanisms to attract  institutional investors (for example with asymmetric returns, to the extent that appropriate products would be made available to the EIF). The EIF could  also maximise fundraising with Member States (via national promotional  banks) to further increase the scheme’s capacity, and aim for optimal  complementarity with other national programmes.   • The EIF could th en carve out funds dedicated to growth -stage venture  capitalists investing in AI scale -ups. This could be done as a pilot similar to  the recently launched European Scale -up Action for Risk Capital Programme,  and could focus purely on AI technologies (block chain is still in the early  stages). In the longer term, funds could be carved out within the dedicated  AI/blockchain investment scheme (currently focused on the startup phase  only, up to Series A). This would contribute to improving opportunities within the European Union for growth -stage SMEs   that might alternatively get  financing outside the European Union, hence also improving exit  opportunities for EU venture capitalists that invested in earlier stages.   B. Monitor the deployment of and consider expanding the AI co -investment  facility to provide additional firepower to AI/blockchain fund managers backed by the EIF that invested in successful SMEs   • The EIB could leverage the InvestEU  programme to monitor and eventually  expand the recent AI co -investment facility to successful venture capitalists  backed by the EIF, while also extending its scope to include blockchain  investments. This facility amounts to €150  million and deployment began in  January  2021. The proposed expansion would complement the  AI/blockchain investment scheme in sustaining the growth of successful  startups and scale -ups through co -investments between the EIB Group and  top-ranked venture capital funds and investment p artners. The operational  burden would be limited by leveraging due diligence performed by the EIF. The facility would invest pari passu with other investors, and would also be  able to deploy smaller tickets. If proven successful, the scale up of the  initiative could be highly impactful.   C. Expand the overall capacity of the EIB venture debt programme to support  successful and innovative SMEs  recovering from the COVID -19 crisis;  potentially also develop a customised thematic (pilot) facility for AI and  blockchain (or a wider “deep- tech” facility)   • The EIB could leverage the InvestEU programme to expand the capacity of its  venture debt programme and strategically focus on innovative firms  struggling to raise their next round of financing in the aftermath o f   COVID -19. Venture debt financing would allow these innovation -driven SMEs   to extend the cash runway until more favourable market conditions return 
   Executive summary  13 for a new independent round of financing, and prevent them suffering  depressed valuations because of the p andemic. The EIB could also consider  expanding programme eligibility to earlier financing stages (such as after  Series A, instead of B/C) and smaller tickets (minimum ticket size is  €7.5  million under the European Growth Finance Facility but €3  million for   companies in moderate innovator countries and €5  million in other countries  under the Pan -European Guarantee Fund (EGF)). A similar setup could also  be envisaged under InvestEU.   • Furthermore, the EIB – in close collaboration with the European Commission  – could explore the development of a thematic (pilot) facility dedicated to  AI/blockchain companies, or a facility with a broader scope covering deep  tech. The setup could be similar to those of successful concepts such as the  Energy Demo Project, Future Mob ility Facility and InnovFin Infectious  Diseases Facility. Compared to the EIB’s generic venture debt product, a  dedicated facility such as this could benefit from higher risk -sharing capacity  and allow for increased risk -taking, in line with the profile of AI and  blockchain companies.   D. Launch a dedicated AI/blockchain call for projects as part of the European Investment Council (EIC), similar to a recent dedicated EIC call on COVID -19,  and consider transforming part of the new and existing grant budget of the EIC into contingent grants and/or forgivable loans   • Up to €2.5  million in grants and €15  million in equity are provided by the EIC  to innovative startups in Horizon 2020 countries. The EIC could launch a specific AI/blockchain call (similar to its re cent call for COVID -19) to give a  dedicated opportunity for researchers and young startups active in this field to turn their projects into successful business solutions. This call should award grants/equity funding and European Commission Seals of Excelle nce.  • With applications to the EIC having more than doubled since the pandemic began, the European Commission could consider transforming part of the new and existing EIC grant budget into forgivable loans or contingent grants. These could be repaid as a lo an if the company is successful and not repaid  otherwise, thus increasing the capacity of the EIC scheme as repaid grants are made available for new grants. The EIC could “outsource” the recovery function (to the EIB or other financial institutions).   Support take up of AI and blockchain technologies in  the market  E. Provide advisory services to EU Member States in the deployment of  AI/blockchain investment programmes to enhance coordination between the  European Union and Member States, and support the deployment of  AI/blockchain technologies by traditional companies (especially SMEs ) that  want to transform their business models in the aftermath o f COVID -19. There  are potential links to the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the Digital Europe  Programme.   The European Commission and Member States have launched several huge  support schemes to promote economic recovery from the COVID -19 crisis.  Acco rdingly, key recommendations include:   • The Commission could consider drawing on some components of the EU level schemes (such as InvestEU) to encourage investments in AI/blockchain technologies that could accelerate the recovery of the hardest- hit sectors.  For example, conditional grants/forgivable loans could be attached to the  deployment of AI/blockchain technology -based solutions and assigned via  specific competitions. In particular, anchoring business models more 
14 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  robustly in AI/blockchain could materiall y benefit sectors such as  automotive, manufacturing, hospitality and education. The Commission  would also need to ensure coordination between the European Union and  Member States in deploying EU and local AI/blockchain investment  programmes.   • Most national promotional banks have launched support schemes in the  aftermath of COVID -19. The EIB Group could deploy coordinated co -funding  models with national promotional banks to ensure that AI/blockchain  technology and startups become more central in local financing responses to  recover from the crisis generated by COVID -19 (for example via the EGF).   • Under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, Member States will prepare  recovery and resilience plans for a coherent package of reforms and public investment projects. Each plan must devote at least 20% of expenditure to fostering the digital transition. To step up financing from other sources, the  EIB could closely collaborate with the European Commission to support  Member States in the design and implementation of thes e plans, exploring  and encouraging top up possibilities by Member States for particular  thematic areas, for example, focusing on the development and deployment of AI/blockchain technologies.   AI is one of the five high -level components of the Digital Europe  Programme.  Given the complexity of AI technologies, deep specialist knowledge could be  required to assess their potential and mitigate significant information  asymmetries that could limit deep tech developers’ access to finance. To bridge the information gap and improve the positioning of digital companies  with respect to investors, one key recommendation is to implement  dedicated advisory support, perhaps through the EIB’s Innovation Finance Advisory team. The activities envisaged could help create the ne cessary  financial preconditions (for example through market intelligence and  development of the investor ecosystem, financial products and blending structures) and pilot initiatives (such as flagship/demonstration projects) that could be further scaled up under InvestEU (complementary to other financial sources such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility).   F. Develop a risk -based framework to assess and certify AI/blockchain   technologies that meet EU -wide “trustworthiness,” ethical and regulatory  requirements; this would help build trust with investors in and deployers of these technologies   • The European Commission could develop a risk -based framework to  determine whether AI/b lockchain -based startups meet “trustworthiness,”  ethical and regulatory requirements (for example on data protection and transparency for AI or on energy consumption for blockchain). The level of  risk could be driven by the sector and intended use of the t echnology.  Assessment of specific projects could be coordinate d by EU digital innovation  hubs , with projects receiving a “green stamp” to denote EU -wide recognition  that their AI/blockchain systems have been developed according to  European standards and re gulations. Potentially, certification could also be  used to grant these projects access to specific EU -wide initiatives, such as  pools of data established under the EU Data Strategy. The EIF could use the  trademark, among other tools, to guide its investments and give confidence  to private investors about a specific technology/company. Digital innovation  hubs could also coordinate regulatory sandboxes to drive the fine -tuning of 
   Executive summary  15 existing (and potentially new) EU regulations to accommodate the specific  featu res of AI/blockchain (based on the EU “innovation principle”),  recognising that AI’s true value lies in sustainability and human -centricity to  ensure fairness and unbiasedness in which EU citizens can trust.   • Regarding trustworthy and ethical AI, a focus on  “gender smart” AI is  particularly recommended to ensure gender equality (linked to SDG 5:  “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls ”). Europe is at  the global forefront of considering AI’s ethical implications,36 aiming to  ensure transparency, diversity, non -discrimination and fairness, and societal  and environmental well -being. Europe is also first in the world to lay out a  proposed legal framework for AI,37 with the goal to turn Europe into the  global hub for tru stworthy AI. These aspects are key for the successful  development and deployment of AI across the whole European Union.   G. Fine -tune EU and Member State public procurement processes to  accommodate the participation of small, young and innovative AI/ blockchain  companies to help turn the European Union’s strong research outputs into  successful businesses   • In line with Open Innovation principles, the European Commission could  further facilitate and encourage the participation of small, young and  innovati ve European AI/blockchain companies in procurement processes at  the EU and Member State level. This would give opportunities for  researchers and young startups to develop AI and blockchain solutions for direct deployment by the public sector, helping reali se the potential of the  European Union’s strong research outputs by giving researchers a lead  “client” for their products in the early stages. It would also help the  deployment of these solutions by the public sector. The Commission could also link public procurement to EU research priorities in AI/blockchain, such as the digitalisation of public administration, defence and climate policy. This could involve, for example, lowering certain thresholds, adjusting minimum  required financial conditions or introd ucing more flexible timelines.    H. Strengthen digital innovation hubs to connect stakeholders of the  AI/blockchain ecosystem across the European Union and foster clusters of  specialisation, as per recommendations in the EIB report titled:  Financing the  digitalisation of small and medium -sized enterprises: The enabling role of  digital innovation hubs   • EU digital innovation hubs are key to creating a network of smart one -stop  advisory hubs to connect AI and blockchain SMEs  across the European Union  with one another and with investors, large corporates, research centres, businesses wishing to deploy these technologies, and all other stakeholders  of the innovation landscape. The hubs should also direct small businesses to  entities providing advisory services and in particular advice on available  funding programmes (for firms wishing to develop or already deploying  AI/blockchain technologies). In each country, digital innovation hubs could  also foster the creation of AI/blockch ain specialisation clusters in specific EU  sector/priority areas (such as healthcare, transport, agriculture, climate and energy).                                                               36 Ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI , European Commission, 2019.   37 Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artific ial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act),  European  Commission, 21 April 2021.  
16 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  I. As part of the EIF AI/blockchain investment scheme, fuel competition and  specialisation in the venture capital market by supporting the creation of new  specialised venture capitalists (first -time funds)   • The EIF, with relevant resources, could focus the AI/blockchain investment  scheme on helping to create new venture capital firms specialised in  AI/blockchain (possessing a mix of business and engineering teams) and  support/sponsor them until they achieve a critical mass and track record  allowing them to raise funds in the market independen tly. This could fuel  competition and expertise in the EU venture capital market by creating a multitude of specialised (and eventually large) funds that could give technical and financial support to European AI and blockchain SMEs .   J. Scale up the Investment Support Programme within the AI/blockchain  investment scheme to establish a networking platform connecting  AI/blockchain companies with relevant investors across the European Union, with particular focus on addressing the investment imbalance in Central,  Eastern and South- Eastern Europe (CESEE)   • The European Commission could establish a networking platform (by scaling up the Investment Support Programme of the AI/blockchain investment  scheme) to facilitate matchmaking between AI and blockchain SME s,  investors and available EIB Group funding programmes. The platform could  help match small firms with appropriate investors based on expertise,  financing stage, location and industry. It could also foster information  exchange between early -stage and grow th-stage investors to share best  practices for scaling up in the EU market, offering advice and knowledge on  cross -border tax and legal affairs. As part of a larger digitalisation effort, the  platform could focus particularly on addressing investment needs  in CESEE  via cooperation and synergy creation with other EU programmes such as the Digital Innovation and Scale -up Initiative.     The above recommendations clearly demonstrate that Europe needs an integrated approach for the development and deployment of AI and blockchain technologies. Financing for AI and blockchain  development and scale -up in the market needs to be stepped up further at all levels, but it is equally  important to strengthen the EU innovation ecosystem .     
   Context, objectives and approach  17 1. Context, objectives and approach   1.1. Context   Disruptive technologies such as a rtificial intelligence (AI) and b lockchain offer  great opportunities  for growth in Europe given  their transformational impact on companies’ products, processes and  business models, as well as on the public sector.  In 2019 it was estimated that global gross domestic  product ( GDP ) could increase by u p to 14% (the equivalent of €13.3 trillion ) by 2030 as a result of the  accelerating development and take- up of AI.38 Blockchain  is also predicted to have a wide -reaching  impact on global GDP by 2025.39  AI and blockchain  are transversal technologies  that  can be used for industrial purposes across several  sectors.  Their disruptive potential derives from the fact that algorithms can be increasingly open sourced and deployed by users across industries. R esearchers and practitioners alike also envisage  increasing disruptions from the convergence of these two technologies, lay ing the groundwork for a  fully digital economy. I ntegrating AI and blockchain  with the system of internet connectivity across  devices ( internet of things, IoT) can lead to even greater opportunities. While this convergence is only  just beginning, it has already started within large corporates and is showing powerful use cases .40  AI and blockchain technologies play increasingly important role s in our economy and are already  having many effects . The economic benefits of AI are visible across several industries. For example,  many retailers are implementing machine learning  algorithms to forecast promotions that will best   drive sales and profits ; these forecasts are already outperforming  human decisions.41 In manufacturing,  advanced analytics based on big- data exploitation are providing opportunities to increase the  efficiency of quality control, lowering the required number of quality inspectors by 60% while reducing  the risk of false defect detection and defect slippage by 21%.42 In banking, it has been estimated that  AI could increase banks’ revenues by as much as 30% and  potentially reduce their costs by 25% or  more.43 For blockchain , different use cases are being developed across many industries  beyond  financial services. For exa mple, a German power company is testing blockchain  technology to manage  billing for autonomous electric -vehicle charging stations , while a large French supermarket company  plans  to use blockchain  to increase transparency and drive value at every step of th e supply chain.   AI and blockchain technologies will also have broader societal impact, bring ing opportunities but  also challenges.44 These technologies  will change our lives by improving healthcare (e.g. diagnosis  precis ion, disease prevention ), increasing the efficiency of farming, contributing to climate change  mitigation and adaptation, transforming ways of work ing across different sectors, increasing citizens’  security, and in troducing possibilities  we can only begin to imagine. Besides oppo rtunities, the   associated  risks must also be considered, including opaque decision -making, gender -based or other  kinds of discrimination, intrusion in private lives and  use for illegal purposes. AI is expected to change  how we work in industries across Eur ope: it is forecast that about 14% of jobs will be automated by AI  and an additional 32% will change significantly. Further  challenges are arising around data protection  and ownership.45  AI and blockchain  technologies are of strategic importance to the European Union and likely to play  central role s in strengthening  technological sovereignty . As key enabling technologies, AI and  blockchain  are the basis for evolving cornerstone industries in Europe and enabling businesses that                                                              38 Sizing the prize: What’s the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise? , PwC, 2018.   39 Building Block(chain)s for a better planet , World Economic Forum , 2018.   40 Come together: The convergence of blockchain, AI and IoT , EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, 2019.   41 Machine learning for retail, Oliver Wyman, 2018.   42 Applying machine learning to manufacturing , Oliver Wyman, 2016.   43 How banks can lead the shift to AI -first, Oliver Wyman, 2018.   44 White paper on artificial intelligence -  A European approach to excellence and trust , European Commission, 2020.   45 The risk of machine- learning bias (and how to prevent it) , Oliver Wyman, 2018.  
18 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  use them to thrive in the long run. Therefore, it is important to keep a competitive edge and avoid  losing out to other international digital hubs such as Silicon Valley ( United States ) and the Digital Silk  Road (China ). A study o f the European Union’s  positioning has outlined th ese challenges and concluded  that scientific, technological and competitive strengths will become globally dispersed in a multipolar  world.46 Besides the ir economic importance for the European Union , AI technologies are expected to  have a broad impact on some of its key ethical and societal goals, for instance,  in achieving the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), supporting democratic process and social rights, and attaining  the goals of the EU Green Deal.47  Access  to finance for AI and blockchain companies is a key  factor in successfully strengthening  this  sector across Europe and t hereby reinforcing the European Union’s international positioning. If AI  and blockchain  technology innovators thrive in Europe, significant parts of the European economy will  likely benefit. Small and medium -sized enterprises ( SMEs ) will have access to cheaper, more efficient   financing options through smarter funding mechanisms. Larger companies will be ahead of or at least  level  with international competit ors in terms of automation and innovation,  enabling them to  reduc e  costs and provid e improved services. Meanwhile, t he public sector will be able to trial AI and  blockchain  technologies for increas ing the effectiveness of administration and other services.   The European Commission has taken several measures to susta in the development and deployment  of AI and blockchain technologies in Europe. Significant funding and other support are provided  through the Digital Europe Programme, InvestEU Programme, Horizon Europe (and before that  Horizon 2020), the EIF AI and blockc hain  pilot, the EIB AI and blockchain  co-investment facility, and  many more initiatives covered in the rest of this report .  Impact of COVID -19 pandemic     The effect s of the pandemic are not fully known at the time of writing this report  (autumn 2020) . Although all  companies across the economy  face significant danger , technology -based companies might be more resilient  in the long term than more traditional enterprises. Most AI and blockchain  SMEs  involved in the study stated  that the COVID -19 crisis has significantly slowed their growth : the share of  these firms are already profitable or  expect ing to be so within one year dropped from 55% before the outbreak to 32%  (as of September 2020) .    However, the market surveys indicate an expectation that the crisis will generate positive commercial  momentum for AI and blockchain  technologies because of  their potential to accelerate digitalisation and re invent key sectors negatively impacted  by the situation . At least 50% of the AI and blockchain  SMEs  expect ed  their competitive position to be strengthened  by focus ing more  on technology -based products and services. The  sectors most positively affected are financial services, healthcare and business intelligence. For companies  developing core , horizontal AI and blockchain  technologies ( riskier but with  higher potential to disrupt several  industries) , the situation is less clear -cut: about 9% of respondents expected  their competitive position to be  strengthened  as a result of COVID -19, while 6% a nticipated becoming less competitive.                                                               46 An analysis of the international positioning of the EU using revealed comparative advantages and the control of key  technologies, European Commission, 2016.   47 Communication:  Building trust in human- centric artificial intelligence , European Commission, April 2019.

20 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  1.2. Objectives   This study’s overall objective is to provide a set of recommendations and actions for  improv ing  access -to-finance conditions for  AI and blockchain companies in Europe , thereby better support ing  the development and deployment of these technologies.  The study builds on current activities  performed by the European Commission , EIB and EIF to evaluate further initiatives to improve access   to finance .  The focus is on SMEs developing AI and blockchain technologies. As defined in EU R ecommendation  2003/361,  companies need to fulfil certain criteria to be considered a s SME s:  Table 2: EU definition criteria for SMEs48  Company category  Staff headcount  Turnover  or Balance sheet total   Medium -sized  < 250  ≤ €50m  ≤ €43m   Small  < 50  ≤ €10m  ≤ €10m   Micro  < 10  ≤ €2m  ≤ €2m     When relevant , the study gives  specific conclusions on startups (a subset of SMEs). While there is no  official definition of startups, they typically fulfil the following three criteria:49  • Have operated for less than five  years;   • Innovate in products, services and/or business model (which covers all SMEs in this study); and   • Are in the early stages of financing (i.e. development and introduction, see Appendix A ) and aim  to  scale  up their business.   1.3. Approach   The study comprises three  step s:  • Step 1. The study analysed the global AI and blockchain  landscape based on EIB and Oliver  Wyman’s experience and expertise in the sector, as well as on  other  existing research, market  analyses, published repor ts and expertise in the sector . Based on proprietary databases, the study  benchmarked the  European Union  with other international geographies and estimated a range for  the equity and debt investment gap  for the two technologies , respectively .  • Step 2. The researchers survey ed over 100 AI and blockchain  SMEs located in the  27 Member  States  and c onducted in -depth interviews with 18 of those SMEs, as well as 19 financial market  participants (including venture capital  funds , corporate venture capital funds , private equity firms ,  banks, national promotional banks, and innovation agencies) . The aim wa s to identify potential  market failures and access -to-finance  barriers .  • Step 3. The study present s a set of recommendations targeting the key market failures and barriers  identified in the previous steps, supported by a high -level cost- benefit analysis and  a high -level  action plan for implement ing these recommendations.                                                               48 Commissio n Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium -sized enterprises.

   Context, objectives and approach  21 1.4. Key inputs   1.4.1.  Databases   Data limitations have , until recently , made it difficult to understand access -to-market conditions for  AI and blockchain SMEs in Europe. Several studies have investigated  aggregated access -to-finance  conditions for European SMEs across all sectors and compare d them against  other geographies. Other  studies have analyse d access -to-finance conditions using firm -level data  but focus ed only  on  established firms , thus under -representing young and innovative companies central to  AI and  blockchain  development and deployment. Most importantly, no  prior studies have specifically  examined AI and blockchain  SMEs using firm -level data, which are  the focus of the reported survey  and investment gap estimations .  This study used a specific data  set of young AI and blockchain  companies with high growth ambitions.  The starting point for data collection was Crunchbase , an online platform where young firms around  the world can present their businesses and financing needs. As stated in the EIB’s 2019/20 Investment  Report (which also relies on Crunchbase  data for access -to-finance analyses), firms’  main incentive to  be li sted in this database is to attract risk capital. Crunchbase  has grown substantial ly in recent years ,  today covering basically all young firms with high growth ambitions, making it a unique data source for  studying such firms.   The data analysed in this study cover  all AI and blockchain SMEs registered on Crunchbase  that have  previously received funding (whether venture capital , private equity , debt financing, grants, etc.)  within six key geographies: the EU27, the United States , China, the United Kingdom , Canada and  Japan. Available information on these firms include s age, type of service/product, location, number of  employees, growth potential (as per the Crunchbase  rank), and several other indicators. A vailable  financial information includes the total a mount of financing raised , the type and amount of the last  financing  received .  The above information has been complemented using  other sources, notably the Preqin  database ,  which includes the total number and value of venture capital  equity investments (at  deal level) across  sectors, time and geographies.   1.4.2.  SME s urvey and interviews   To understand the key bottlenecks on  the demand side that may limit access  to finance for AI and  blockchain SMEs, the researchers conducted a detailed survey o f 108 AI and blockchain SMEs in  the  EU27 and follow -up interviews with 18 of them  to discuss specific insights in more detail.  Figure 5  shows the proportion of SMEs surveyed by region, technology (AI vs. blockchain ), annual turnover and  financing life -cycle stage (development, introduction, or growth – due to the young nature of these  industr ies, no surveyed SMEs are  in the maturity stage).   The study covers about 9% of all EU27 SMEs labelled as AI and/or  blockchain  that have previously  received funding (this population in Crunchbase  numbers  around 1  250 firms) . The vast majority of  SMEs in th e target population are at  early financing stages (i.e. development and introduction). A nnual  turnover is below  €1 million  for more than 70%  of these SMEs , and €1–10 million  for most of the  remain der.  Survey r espondents provide wide coverage of EU27 countries and are well balanced between regions.   About 37% of respondents are in Central Europe, 20% in Western Europe, 19% in Southern Europe,  14% in Eastern Europe and 1 1% in Northern Europe. This distribution is in line with the overall  population of AI and blockchain  SMEs in the Crunchbase  database.  
22 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Figure 5: Overview of survey ed and interview ed SMEs     1.4.3.  Interviews  with financial market participants   To understand the key bottlenecks on  the supply side that may limit access  to finance for AI and  blockchain  SMEs , the researchers conducted 19 interviews with a broad range of financial market  participants.  Figure 6 shows the proportion of institutions interviewed by region and type .  The study focused on venture capital , corporate venture capital  and private equity  firms, as most  SMEs expressed a preference for equity financing .50 The targeted investors included specialis ts in AI  and blockchain  investment s, as well as more generalist funds interested (but not specialised ) in  innovative companies. Also , representatives from  a selection of commercial banks, national  promotional banks  and innovation agencies were interviewed. Finally, the EIF VC Investment and  Research teams and the EIB Venture Debt team were interviewed, given their role in financing   innovative companies in Europe.   The interview ees provide wide coverage of the EU27 and additional insight s from non -EU case  studies.  The significant proportion of interview ed institutions operating primarily in Western Europe  is due to the higher prevalence of AI and blockchain  SMEs in this region . Nonetheless, EU13 -based   institutions are also included to ensure that the study’s results are representative across all Member   States .                                                              50 Crunchbase data, Oliver Wyman analysis.

   The AI and blockchain  landscape  25 2. The AI and blockchain  landscape   2.1. Artificial intelligence   2.1.1.  Definition   The High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence ( set up by the European Commission)  defines  AI as “systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions –  with some degree of autonomy –  to achieve specific goals. ”52 AI-based systems can be purely software based, acting in the virtual world (e.g. voice assistants, image -analysis software, search engines,  speech - and face -recognition systems) , or embedded in hardware devices (e.g. advanced robots,  autonomous cars, drones or IoT  applications).   The most notable abilities  of AI technologies include:   • Learn ing from past experiences and apply ing the insights in future  situations  (e.g. intelligen t  routing, optimise d energy usage);   • Identify ing patterns and meanings behind qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. understand ing  human language, perform ing facial recognition); and   • Recogni sing and act ing on environment changes  (e.g. auto nomous driving).   Figure 7: Key features of AI                                                                 52 A definition of Artificial Intelligence: Main capabilities and scientific disciplines , High -Level Expert Group on Artificial  Intelligence, 8 April 2019 ( link, accessed 6 April 2020).   
26 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  2.1.2.  Key trends across domains and sectors   The AI landscape can be analysed in terms of the core technology of the AI service/product (domain)  and the sector in  which the AI service/product is deployed. Different technologies will have different  maturity levels and financing requirements, e.g. depending on whether hardware or software and on  the development time required for the specific product/sector. Virtually all sectors in the EU economy  are embracing AI technologies , but some sectors have so far deployed them more systematically .   This section overview s AI subdomains and key sectors, drawing on information from several recent  studies. Please refer to the Euro pean Commission’s AI watch:  TES analysis of AI worldwide ecosystem  in 2009 –2018 for a detailed and rigorous analysis of this topic.   AI key domains   AI embraces a broad group of domains, including:53  • Machine learning (ML)  – the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through  experience.54 Since the 2000s, with the advent of faster central and graphics processing units , ML  algorithms have become  increasingly accurate  and are  now used in  tasks across all economi c  activities, especially for pattern detection.   • Natural language processing  (NLP)  – a range of com putational techniques for analys ing and  representing naturally occurring text to achieve human -like language processing.55 NLP has  developed quickly  since the 2000s and is now typically used in  tasks such as speech -to-text  transcription and machine translation.   • Computer vision  – the development of  computers to gain high -level understanding from digital  images or videos. With significant recent increase s in computing power and available data,  accuracy rates of computer vision algorithms have increased from 50% to 99% in less than a  decade.56 Computer vision is often used in  tasks such as image analysis and classification or facial  recognition.   • Robotics and a utomation  – using the potential of AI to automate processes or program me robots  to perform specific tasks autonomously. This is a relatively young field of AI , but grow ing quickly.  Between 2012 and 2018, the number of industrial robots more than doubled from 150  000 to over  400 000 installed units, performing repetitive but physically challenging tasks in the manufacturing  sector.57  • Connected and a utomated vehicles  – a range  of computational techniques to allow the interaction  of autonomous vehicles with the environment, subject to  varying degrees of human intervention.  These technologies  can potentially have  a large impact on the economy and environment,  including fewer  vehi cles per household, increased traffic efficiency, and fewer  traffic accidents.   • AI processing units  – hardware devices optimi sed for us ing AI technology. Though  a relatively new  field of AI , it is  projected to grow strongly from a total market size of $6.6 billion  in 2018 to  $91 billion  in 2025.58 The increased need for AI processing units is driven by several factors, most  important ly the development of smart cities, rising demand for smart homes, and the emergence  of quantum computing.   • AI services  – the bro adest domain of AI , contain ing all related services not classified in any of the  above categories , such as databases and visualisation software that either use AI technologies to  improve the service or allow the user to use AI technologies him/herself.                                                               53 AI watch –  TES analysis of AI worldwide ecosystem in 2009 -2018, European Commission ( link, accessed on 20 May 2020).   54 Tom Mitchell, Machine learning , 1997.   55 Elizabeth Liddy, Natural language processing , 2001 ( link, accessed 20 May 2020).   56 Computer vision, SAS Insights ( link, accessed 20 May 2020).   57 Annual installations of industrial robots , International Federation of Robotics, 2019.   58 AI chip market , Allied Market Research ( link, accessed 20 May 2020).  
   The AI and blockchain  landscape  27 Figure 8: AI segmentation by domain     AI key sectors   While virtually all sectors in the EU economy are embracing AI technologies, deploy ment  has been  more systematic in certain sectors and the application of AI varies across jurisdictions. In  Europe, the  United States  and India , a relatively  large share  of AI firms operate in information and communications  or in professional, scientific and t echnical activities. By contrast , in China, about half of the country’ s  AI firms operate in manufacturing,59 mirroring  the overall strength of China in th at sector. Japan  present s a more balanced distribution of AI firms across different sectors; in particular, more than 25%  operate in manufacturing and a prominent share  in wholesale and retail trade, which is similar to the  situation in the United States  and Canada.                                                               59 AI watch –  TES analysis of AI worldwide ecosystem in 2009 -2018, European Commission.   
28 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Figure 9: AI firms by economic sector (%), 2009 –201860    Reaffirming the findings of  several prior studies , interviewees were almost unanimous  in expect ing  AI technologies to have an increasingly disruptive impact on all sectors of the EU economy. A more  granular segmentation of the main sectors affected  by AI technologies is a vailable in Appendix B ,  including example of use of AI services/products in each  sector .  2.1.3.  Key benefits of AI for companies   Across domains and sectors,  companies embra cing AI solutions typically benefit from higher  productivity and efficiency.  Research suggests that AI could double economic growth rates by 2035  and increase labour productivity by up to 40%.61 In particular, companies can benefit from:   • Increased productivity , typically achieved via better decision -making processes.62 For example:   – AI can accelerate  decision -making, enabling early pattern detection. In healthcare, for instance,  this translates into the possibility of using natural language processing  to detect early  symptoms of a heart attack during a  call to emergency services by analysing speech patterns  and unconscious signals;   – AI can also enable more accurate decision -making by spotting anomalies or longer -term trends  that cannot be easily detected  by other methods. Again in  healthcare, computer vision  technology can support doctors in identifying specific signs  of a disease  in X-ray and MRI  scans ;63  • Higher efficiency , typically achieved via automating manual processes.64 For example:   – AI can facilitate the  automatic generat ion of  machine -readable legal and compliance  documentation, reducing the time need ed for drafting and analysing such documents; and   – AI can also enable  automated language and speech recognition. In practice,  enterprises can  use this function to deploy chatbots, thus decreasing the time employees spend in calls.   Companies embracing AI solutions typically also benefit from more reliable and unbiased processes.  AI can help improve diagnostics and the reliability of frequent, stru ctured, specific tasks, for example  by helping diagnose the abrasion status of machines and scheduling preventive maintenance.65                                                              60 AI watch –  TES analysis of AI worldwide ecosystem in 2009 -2018, European Commission.   61 Accenture research ( link, accessed 26 May 2020).   62 Artificial intelligence innovation report , Deloitte, 2018 ( link, accessed 20 May 2020).   63 Hosny et al. , Artificial intelligence in radiology , 2018 ( link, accessed 18 May 2020).   64 Understanding the benefits of AI , Goetzpartners, 2018 ( link, accessed 18 May 2020).   65 Introduction to the advantages of AI, EDUCBA ( link, accessed on 15 May 2020).   
   The AI and blockchain  landscape  29 Moreover, AI can mitigate human bias and errors caused by psychological or emotional factors.66  Additionally, AI systems can beco me increasingly  accurate over time as more data are  used to refine  models.   2.1.4.  Key ongoing initiatives within the  European Union  The European Union has taken important actions and initiatives to support the development of AI  in Europe , including through the  “European approach to Artificial Intelligence and Robotics .”67 This  approach addresses  technological, ethical, legal and socioeconomic aspects of AI to boost  the  European Union ’s research and industrial capacity and to put AI at the service of Europe ’s citizens and  economy. Th e European approach is based on three pillars:   1. Being ahead of technological developments and encouraging uptake by the public and private  sectors, with a target of reaching €20 billion  in investment per year over the next decade;   2. Prepa re for socioeconomic changes brought about by AI; and   3. Ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework.   The European Commission has also introduced several additional initiatives covering different  aspects of AI , such as  the Coordinated plan on AI , the Ethics guidelines for a Trustworthy AI , the  Declaration of cooperation on a rtificial intelligence , and the N ew rules and actions for excellence and  trust in Artificial Intelligence, including a Proposal for a Regulation.   In early 2020 the  European Union published four documents that clear ly indicat e the Commission’s  key priorities and anticipated next steps. Among these, the White paper on artificial intelligence  – A  European approach to excellence and trust  proposes several measures to streamline research , foster  collaboration between Member States and increase investment in AI development and deployment. It  also includes  policy options for a future EU regulatory framework that would determine the types of  legal requirements applicable  to relevant actors, particularly  focus ing on high -risk applications. T he  four documents are overviewed in Table 4.                                                                    66 Ben Hartwig, Benefits of artificial intelligence  (link accessed on 15 May 2020).   67 Shaping Europe’s digital future.

30 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Table 4: European Commission strategies for AI and data   Document Title Summary   White paper on  artificial  intelligence – A  European approach  to excellence and  trust  • Emphasi ses the importance of establishing a uniform approach  to AI  in the   European Union to avoid barriers to the EU S ingle Market   • Plans a risk-based approach  to regulating AI.  Specifically, the Commission  proposes to focus in the near term on “high -risk” AI applications :  – High -risk sectors: healthcare, transport, energy, and parts of the public sector   – High -risk applications:  those with potential to produce lega l or similarly  significant effects on the rights of an individual or company, and those used for  remote biometric ID   • High -risk applications  would require  mandatory pre -marketing conformity  assessment requirements , while lower -risk applications could be subject to a  voluntary label ling scheme   • Proposes several measures for  promot ing an “ecosystem of AI excellence,”  including research funding, skills development and partnerships with the private  sector   Communication on  a European  strategy for data  • Articulates  the European Union’s  aspiration to be a role model  as a society  powered by data to make better decisions   • Proposes a four -pillar strategy  that includes:   – A cross- sectoral governance framework  for data access and use that will cover,  among other measures, new EU mechanisms and guidance on data sharing   – Enablers: investments  in data and strengthening of the  European Union’s  capabilities and infrastructure  for hosting, processing and using data, a nd  fostering interoperability   – Building competencies  through greater investment in digital skills and in SMEs   – Development of common European data spaces  in strategic sectors and  domains of public interest   Communication on  shaping Europe’s  digital future  • Sets out a vision  for a European society powered by digital solutions and  rooted in  common European values:   – Ensure that technology works for people   – Foster a fair and competitive economy   – Enable an open, democratic and sustainable society  • Describes the  Europea n Union’s plans to increase European investment  in  technological innovation, to reduce reliance on digital solutions developed outside  Europe   • Recommends enhancing regulatory frameworks  to ensure fairness, support user  choice, prevent the over -concentration of market power , etc .   Report on the  safety and liability  implications of AI,  the IoT and robotics  • Focuses on the current EU product safety regime , drawing the conclusion that it  contains a number of gaps that need to be addressed   • Proposes updating the existing framework to ensure , for example,  that  compensation is always available for damage caused by products that are defective  because of software or other digital features   • The ne w challenges posed by AI in terms of safety create also new c hallenges in  terms of liability; pointing toward the need for certain adjustments to the Product Liability Directive and national liability regimes through appropriate EU initiatives       
   The AI and blockchain  landscape  31   One ke y priorit y of the European Commission’s Coordinated plan on AI  is to encourage Member  States to develop their national AI strategies, outlining investment levels and implementation  measures.68 While several EU Member States have already signalled their commitment to AI by  publishing national AI strategies, others are still developing their strategies . As of February 2020, 20  members  have published their AI strategies or have a final draft at han d, one has an action plan as an  initial step to wards  develop ing the national strategy , and six have started consultations with  intergovernmental working groups to develop their strategies.

32 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  2.2. Blockchain   2.2.1.  Definition   Blockchain is defined as “a technology that allows people and organisations to reach agreement on  and permanently record transactions and information in a transparent way without a central  authority. ”70  Since its creation in 2008, blockchain technology has been mainly linked to f inancial services and  cryptocurrencies; however, it is now expanding into other domains . The potential of blockchain   technologies goes well beyond cryptocurrencies and financ e, and there is a growing number of use  cases outside the financial sector. While the fintech sector remains  at the forefront of blockchain   developments, more organisations in other  sectors , such as media and telecommunications,  healthcare and government ser vices , are expanding and diversifying their blockchain  initiatives.   Key features of blockchain  technologies include the following:71  • A decentralis ed consensus mechanism is used to validate transactions and guarantee the  authenticity of data;   • Data are represented as blocks in a sequence, making new data (e.g. new transactions) irrevocable.  Each data point added is a new block  that references its predecessor. A change is , therefore,  impossible  as all blocks are connected; and   • Data are stored in a chain o f blocks in several locations. As long as each  block has access to its  predecessor, all other data can be stored in different locations , i.e. in a decentrali sed manner .  Figure 11: Key features of blockchain                                                                 70 Shaping Europe’s digital future. Blockchain Strategy.

   The AI and blockchain  landscape  33 2.2.2.  Key trends across domains and sectors   Blockchain  domains   In line with the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum’s map 72, blockchain  can cover several  different domains , as represented in Figure 12. Payments and international transactions is the most  common blockchain  domain s o far, reflecting  the historical development of this technology in relat ion  to cryptocurrencies and the financial sector more broadly. IT s ecurity, copyright and intellectual  property ( IP) protection, and d igital identity and voting are other emerging domains, all of which build  their use case s predominantly on the security aspect of blockchain . Other domains include p rocess  digitalisation, tracking of goods, supply chain, and the internet of things .  Figure 12: Blockchain  segmen tation by domain     Blockchain  sectors   Blockchain has a wide range of use  cases  in the f inancial services sector. The most common functions   are:73  • Payments and remittance : Cross -border payments are usually intermediated by clearing firms ,  and thus usually subject to intermediation costs in multiple layers that induce operational  complexity and counterparty risks. By  contrast, blockchain  allow s for direct peer -to-peer  transactions that limit the need for intermediaries;                                                               72 EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum ( link).  73 Analysing the deploymen t of blockchain and DLT in the financial sector , N-ABLE, 2019.   
34 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  • Credit and lending : The use of  smart contracts presents potential benefits that could make lending  safe and prevent crises. Blockchain  technologies are also used to raise capital through  crowdfunding and other means and can  potential ly impact on classic and new financial  intermediaries . Examples include blockchain -based tokens and i nitial coin offerings;   • Trading and settlement : The use of blockchain  technologies can lead to near- real-time clearing  and settlement, reducing risks related to duplicated records and associated time lags;   • Compliance : Blockchain  technologies can be implemented to specifically address financial  reporting and compliance issues. B lockchain  could make it possible to record  players and actions  in a transparent, streamlined fashion and in line with regulatory requ irements; and   • Asset management: There are m ultiple use cases in th is area, such as  initiatives focused on the  fund distribution value chain and the development of smart t ransfer agents.   Beyond finance, blockchain represents a possible breakthrough for a br oad range of industrial  sectors, thanks to new technological notions such as disintermediation and efficiency gains that  could be key to these industries.74 Having begun  as the basis of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,  blockchain  technology – essentially a virtual ledger for recording and verifying a high volume of digital  transactions – is now spreading across a wave of industries. A nnual global spending on blockchain   applications has almost tripled since 2017 and is expected to reach nearly $16 billion  by 2023.75  Bitcoin’s popularity helped demonstrate  the application of blockchain in finance, but entrepreneurs  now believe that blockchain could transform  many more industries. Ultimately, the use cases for a  transparent, verifiable register of transaction data span across several sectors. Industries from  insurance to gaming to real estate are starting to realise the value of blockchain  applications. Examples  of potential applications are manifold and encompass  secure data sharing between healthc are  providers , documentation of transactions along a supply chain , and  connecting buyers and sellers  without a n intermediary  in the retail sector.76  2.2.3.  Key benefits of blockchain for companies   Companies that embrace blockchain  technologies can benefit from several improvements:77  • Stronger trust and security  through decentrali sed storage and common acceptance by all  participants  of the security of stored data . This supports combating fraud , proving the quality and  origin of goods , and tracing faulty materials in supply chains;78  • Verified information, which includes the possibility to confirm the authenticity of a document, diploma or other information stored by blockchain  enterprises; and   • Reduced complexity and increased reliability, as using decentralised storage decreas es the  probability that a server shutdown will make data inaccessib le.  2.2.4.  Key ongoing initiatives within the  European Union  The European Commission has outlined a holistic approach to blockchain technologies,  which aims  to position Europe at the forefront of blockchain innovation and uptake. In this rapidly evolving  context, the European Union  relies on several initiatives to enable globally inclusive governance,  reinforce cooperation and investments in deploy ing blockchain -based  applications, and support                                                              74 Banking Is Only The Beginning: 58 Big Industries Blockchain Could Transform.

   The AI and blockchain  landscape  35 international standard -setting. These initiatives aim to facilitate dialogue between industry  stakeholders and regulators, notably towards  a regulatory framework that builds on the EU acquis.   The several initi atives that the European Union is promoting to foster a more coordinated EU -wide  approach to developing  and deploy ing blockchain technologies include:  • The European Blockchain Partnership: Created through a signed declaration in April 2018, the  Partnership  establishes  political collaboration between  all EU Member States and members of the  European Economic Area (Norway and Liechtenstein) towards realising the potential of  blockchain -based services to benefit citizens, society and the economy.   • The European Bl ockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI):  This joint initiative between  the European  Commission  and the European Blockchain Partnership  aims to deliver EU -wide cross -border public  services using blockchain  technology. The EBSI will form  a network of distrib uted nodes across  Europe, leveraging an increasing number of applications focused on specific use cases. In 2020 the  EBSI became a fully operational Connecting Europe Facility  Building Block, providing reusable  software, specifications and services to supp ort adoption by EU institutions and European public  administrations.   • The European Blockchain Observatory and Forum:  The mission of the forum is to promote  blockchain  in Europe by mapping existing blockchain  initiatives, analysing and reporting on  important  blockchain  themes, promoting blockchain  education and knowledge sharing, and  holding events to promote debate and discussion.   • The International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications: Launched on 3 April 2019, the  Association  is a Brussels- based multistakeholder organisation that  brings together suppliers and  users of distributed ledger technology with representatives of governmental organisations and standard -setting bodies. Members share the common vision of promoting transparent governance,  interoperability, legal certainty and trust in services enabled by blockchain  and distributed ledger  technology .  Additional blockchain  initiatives at the EU level include the formation of an industry -driven community,  established at  the EU Blockchain Industry  Roundtable held in 2018; 79 the #Blockchain4EU initiative  touching upon blockchain  for industrial transformations;80 and the launch of the “Blockchain for Social  Good” challenge and associated prize.81  As of April 2020 only five of the EU27 countries have published a national blockchain  strategy,  though another  five are developing or planning to develop a strategy , while a further  five are using  government -supported activities to promote blockchain . This shows that blockchain  is at a n earlier  stage than AI  in the EU27 . However, some of the countries not currently shaping a blockchain  strategy  are undertaking other initiatives to advance blockchain  technologies: for example, the Estonian  government strongly promotes blockchain  and applie s the technology in its services ,82 while the  Lithuanian government has created a dedicated blockchain  sandbox.83                                                              79 Shaping Europe’s digital future.

   The AI and blockchain  landscape  37 2.3. Convergence of AI, blockchain  and IoT  The opportunities presented by AI and blockchain technologies are likely to be applied in  conjunction with each other , converging in new kinds of platforms, products and services. Their  integration with systems of internet connectivity across devices (IoT)  can lead to even greater  opportunities.85 In this technological convergence, IoT can be considered the  “sensing”  part, AI the  “thinking”  part, and blockchain  the “remembering” part.86 For large -scale emerging use cases such as  smart cities, converged techno logies can be applied in infrastructure to manage critical systems and   improve residents’ quality of life through safer and better- designed urban environments.87  Both IoT and blockchain can be deployed as key enablers for developing  and implement ing AI by  provid ing the large data sets  required for AI learning.88 IoT is a key element for data generation and  collection ; as IoT devices become cheaper and more widely utilised , they will provide increasingly large  amounts of data. Blockchain  can serve as a large  repository of validated records , and could thus  support AI learning. In combination , IoT and blockchain  can significantly lower the cost of data  collection , thus  avoiding the concentration of AI among only a  few large stakeholders.89  The decentralised network system of blockchain can offer ways to address the needs  of companies  and individuals for security, privacy and resilience in the context of AI and IoT.90 As IoT becomes  more widespread, more consumer data will be collected, thereb y increas ing society’s needs for  security and data protection . Blockchain  could make IoT infrastructure more scalable and robust,  provide secure audit trails of information , and increase the interoperability of IoT devices by providing  a trusted, common co mmunications layer. B lockchain  could also support the establishment of open,  decentralised markets in which data producers can sell, rent or share their data, AI models and  resources.   The c ombination of AI, blockchain  and IoT can open new operational and c ommercial opportunities.  Potential future e xamples of combined applications include:91  • Retail:  AI can enable predictive action based on data collected from IoT devices (e.g. ordering food),  while blockchain  can support  secure transaction processing;   • Healthcare : AI can enable monitoring of medic al data, early detection of abnormalities  and  automatic scheduling of appointments, while blockchain  can provide a secure , accurate medical  history;   • Cybersecurity : AI can enable fast , accurate data analysis, making logical decisions  and taking  autonomous action s, while blockchain  can store a secur e record of potential evidence; and   • Manufacturing : AI can enable comprehensive remote status and performance monitoring of  machines across the globe, machine learning -pow ered proactive maintenance , and the  assignment of the most  suitable  technician with replacement parts , while blockchain  can provide  a secure way of purchasing.   Conversely, the combined application of these technologies poses  risks and challenges to consider  and mitigate.92 From a technological perspective, this convergence will bring the difficulty of   protecting billions of entry points in IoT . It will also exacerbate legal and regulatory complexities, for                                                              85 The European Commission describes the IoT as “the next step towards digitisation where all objects and people can be  interconnected through communication networks, in and across private, public and industrial spaces, and report about  their status and/or about the status of the surrounding environment.” See Advancing the internet of things in Europe, Commission staff working document , European Commission, 2016.   86 Transformational technologies: Today -  How IoT, AI, and blockchain will revolutionize business , Oracle, 2018.   87 Convergence of blockchain, AI and IoT , EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, 2020.   88 Blockchain -enabled convergence, Outlier Ventures Research, 2018.   89 Convergence of blockchain, AI and IoT , EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, 2020.   90 Blockchain -enabled convergence, Outlier Ventures Research, 2018.   91 Transformational technologies: Today -  How IoT, AI, and blockchain will revolutionize business , Oracle, 2018.   92 Convergence of blo ckchain, AI and IoT , EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, 2020.

   The EU and international ecosystems for AI and blockchain  39 3. The EU and international ecosystems for AI and  blockchain   3.1. Number of AI and blockchain  SMEs   As discussed in Section 1.4.1 , the study selected all AI and blockchain SMEs registered on Crunchbase   that have previously received funding (whether venture capital , private equity , debt financing,  grants, etc.) within six  key geographies: the EU27, the United States , China, the United Kingdom ,  Canada and Japan. While Crunchbase  can be seen as representative for most countries ,94 its coverage   in China  is less complete. Hence , data  for Chinese AI SMEs were taken from the Chin a AI d evelopment  report , and the number of Chinese blockchain  SMEs covered  in the Crunchbase  database was  interpolated accordingly .  The highest number of AI and blockchain SMEs is in the United States  (2 995), more than China  (1 418) and the EU27 (1  232) combined. The United Kingdom  is another notable player (495) .  Across all geographies,  AI SMEs dominate  over blockchain SMEs , represent ing 70–85% of the total.  In the United States , EU27 and United Kingdom , around 8 0% of SMEs in the  AI/blockchain  landscape   are AI -focused . In China , the share of AI SMEs is slightly lower (71%), wh ereas  Canada ( 84%) and Japan  (86%) have higher shares of AI -focused SMEs .  Figure 14: Total number of AI and blockchain SMEs across international geographies , April 202095      The picture changes when considering  the density of AI /blockchain SMEs based on the size of the  work force in each geography . The United States  remains the leading region , with 18.2 SMEs per 1  million  workers,  followed by  the United Kingdom  (14.7) and Canada (11.6) . The EU27 shows a  density                                                              94 China AI development report , China Institute for Science and Technology Policy at Tsinghua University, 2018.   95 Crunchbase data, Oliver Wyman analysis.

Figure 15: Total number of AI and blockchain SMEs per 1 million  workers,  April 202096      Looking  at the financing life  cycle, the  European Union has a significantly larger proportion of AI and  blockchain SMEs in the development stage, compared to the United States , where SMEs are more  financially mature  (see Appendix A  for an overview of financing at different life -cycle  stages ). The  proportion of growth -stage SMEs is lower in the EU27  than in the United States, while the two  geographies have a very similar proportion of SMEs in the introduction stage . Very few AI /blockchain   SMEs in either region have reached the maturity stage of financing  – they typically become large  corporates at this stage and the two industries, especially blockchain , are relatively young.                                                                 96 Crunchbase data, World Bank data ( link, accessed 20 May 2020), Oliver Wyman analysis.

I n most regions AI SMEs represent ≥ 76% of the  total, but the EU13 has a more balanced split between AI (65%) and blockchain  (35%) SMEs.

42 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  3.2. Global equity investments in AI and blockchain   Data on venture capital  investments in AI and blockchain SMEs  during 2010 –2019 were sourced from  the Preqin database, covering the EU27, United States , China, United Kingdom , Canada and Japan.  These data are  broadly consistent with those used by  the OECD (Crunchbase )99 and CB  Insights.100  Global ly, venture capital  investments in AI and blockchain have grown rapidly over the past decade ,  exceeding  $30 billion  in 2019 , dominated by the United States  and China. In t he EU27 these  investment s grew  from $0.3 billion  in 2016 to over $2 billion  in 2019, representing an increase f rom  3% to 7% of the global total . After relatively steady growth from 2012 to 2016 , global investments  dramatically increased in 2017 and 2018 , mainly driven by investments in China.  As shown in  Figure  18, investments in the United States  doubled between 2016 and 2018 , while those in China increased  eight fold. It should be noted that seven deals of over $500 million  each were transacted  in China  in  2018, which explains that year’s exceptionally high figures . In 2019 global investments grew only   slightly compared to 2018 , mainly reflecting lower investments in China. However, from 2018 to 2019,  investments increased by about 45% in the United States and more than doubled  in the EU27  (from  $0.9 billion in 2018 to $2.16 billion) .    Figure 18: Total estimated venture capital  equity investment in AI and blockchain SMEs by geography ,  2010– 2019101    AI accounts for the largest share of these venture capital  investments ( about 90%). In 2019 over $28  billion  was invested in AI SMEs in the six focal regions , while  blockchain  accounted for about $3 billion   of investments . AI investments grew almost exponential ly between 2012  and 2018, then rose more  slowly in 2019. Blockchain  investments peak ed in 2018 but then decreased in 2019  – a delayed reaction  to the falling value of cryptocurrencies during 2018.102                                                              99 Private equity investment in artificial intelligence , OECD, 2018 ( link, accessed 26 May 2020).   100 The blockchain report 2020 , CB Insights, 2020.   101 Preqin data, Oliver Wyman analysis.   102 Blockchain trends in review , CB Insights, 2019.

This is  in line with the  above  finding that the EU27 has a higher proportion of development -stage SMEs compared to the  United States . Conversely , the United States  and China have the highest proportion of venture capital   investments in growth -stage SMEs (i.e. Series C onwards ), indicating greater focus on more mature  companies.

Key enablers for AI and blockchain  technologies   This section discusses selected key enablers to assess the level of readiness to develop and deploy  AI and blockchain  technologies across the EU27 and other major geographies. Comparisons focus  mostly on the United States  and China, as these counties have the largest number of AI and blockchain   SMEs and the highest total, average and median venture capital investments in the field. More  generally, the EU27, United States  and China are widely considered to be among the main competitors  for global leadership in AI and blockchain .106 The study concentrates on three dimensions :  • Talent and research publications;   • Digital economy performance; and   • Data a vailability.   Overall, the EU27 ’s business environment provides a strong basis for compet ing with the United  States  and China, the two leading regions in AI and blockchain . The EU27 has more specialised  researchers than its peers, and typically produces the most technology -related academic research .  Some Member States  also show  rather strong digital performance (as mea sured by the International  Digital Economy and Society Index , I-DESI), indicating that the region is well positioned to  deploy AI  and blockchain  technologies across different sectors. It also shows a r evealed competitive advantage   in the development of sev eral key domains of AI. However, in terms of data availability the EU27 is  currently disadvantage d compared to China and the United States , which could especially limit the  development of AI technologies ( whose models need to be trained with large amount s of data). Linking   these findings to those above on the number of AI and blockchain  SMEs and total, average and median  venture capital investments, the EU27 has a strong set of enablers in place  but is struggling to put its  talent and digital readiness to economic and social use s.                                                              105 Preqin data, Oliver Wyman analysis.   106 Digital transformation monitor.

   The EU and international ecosystems for AI and blockchain  45 3.3.1.  Talent and research publications   Talent is a key enabler for a region’s competitiveness in developing  and deploy ing innovative  technologies  in the current and future ecosystem s. As growing numbers of industries and firms are  likely to adopt these technologies, the availability of talent needs to match the expected rise in demand  over  the coming years. Thus, it is essential to ensure access  to a large pool of highly qualified potential  staff. This analysis  employs  the results of a study by  the Center for Data Innovation  that compared  Europe, the United States  and China across several talent -related dimensions.107  The European Union has a large pool of talent ; in certain areas  it is ahead of the United States  and  China.  In terms of total AI researchers, Europe has the largest talent pool , with an estimated 43  064 AI  researchers (of whom 7 998 are in the United Kingdom ), compared with 28 536 in the United States   and 18  232 in China ( although  Europe and the United States  have a similar number when adjusting for  workforce  size).108 Europe is also strong ly position ed in the quality of AI researche rs as measure d by  the h-index . In 2017 Europe had an estimated 5  787 top AI researchers (of whom  1 117 are in the  United Kingdom ), ahead of the United States  (5 158) and China (977).109 On the  second measure of  quality, i.e. the number of authors publishing at leading AI academic conferences around the world,  the United States  ranked top  (10 295) , followed by  Europe (4  840).   Figure 22: Selected metrics for AI talent per geography  in 2017110  Metric  Europe  United  States  China   Number of AI researchers  43 064 28 536 18 232  Number of AI researchers per 1 million  workers  172.9  173.1  23.2   Number of top AI researchers  5 787 5 158 977  Number of top AI researchers per 1 million  workers  23.2  31.3  1.2  Number of top AI researchers (academic conferences)  4 840 10 295 2 525  Number of top AI researchers (academic conferences) per 1 million   workers  19.4  62.4  3.2    However, despite the large av ailability of AI talent in Europe, European businesses have fewer  AI  employees than US firms. For example , half of the global top  20 companies for AI patents  are based  in the United States  and have a combined total of 1  623 AI -specialis t researchers (averag ing about 160  per company) . By contrast , six of the top  20 are in the EU27 , with a combined total of 552 AI  researchers (averag ing less than 90 per company).111  Europe has made a leading contribution t o publi shing  AI-related research over the last two decades.  However, China recently took  the lead in this domain. Neither AI n or blockchain  are mature  technologies  and research in both fields is expected to drive great advancements in the coming  years .  Thus, it is important to assess the research potential across different regions. The volume of published  AI research has increased globally  over the past decade, especially over the last five  years  (see Figure  23). In the number of published AI paper s, Eur ope led  China until  recently and still has considerable  source s of knowledge and innovation at its disposal for European startups to build on. In terms of the                                                              107 Who is winning the AI race: China, the EU or the United States? , Center for Data Innovation, 2019.   108 AI researchers are those who published an AI -related journal article or registered an AI patent between 2007 and 2017.   109 The h- index measures the productivity and influence of researchers: see J.

Digital economy performance   The potential for an economy to embrace AI and blockchain technologies is another key element of  the ecosystem. Th is study refers to  the I-DESI  to understand the relative maturity of different  economies with respect to  AI and blockchain  technologies.   Several European countries perform strong ly in the I -DESI, but there is large variance within Europe.   The I -DESI is a composite index from the European Commission that summarises the relative digital  performance of several economies around the world . In th e 2018 I -DESI report the average value of  the index across all European countries was lower than the values of the United States , Canada and  Japan, but higher than that of  China. However, there is  large variance across the EU27 Member States .  While t he top -4 EU countries (i.e. Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden) were  ranked second  globally , only  behind South Korea , the bottom  4 EU countries found themselves at the lower end of  the global ranking, although still ahead of China.                                                               112 Field -Weighted Citation Impact: Ratio of total citations received by a publication to average citations received in the field.   113 Who is winning the AI race: China, the EU or the United States? , Center for Data Innovation, 2019, based on data from  Elsevier.   114 Based on data from Artificial intelligence index report 2019 , Stanford University, 2019, based on data from Elsevier;  papers indexed in SCOPUS.

The availability of data is essential for training AI systems, whose  products and services are rapidly moving from pattern recognit ion and insight generation to more  sophisticated forecasting techniques requir ing extensive databases.117 The amount of data produced  in the world is growing rapidly : it is expected to rise from 33 zettabytes118 in 2018 to 175 zettabytes in  2025, presenting ma jor opportunities for the  European Union  to position itself in this space.119 Limited  availability of large data  sets in a market can pose significant challenges for innovative SMEs.  Blockchain  does not rely on data availability to the same extent as AI , and is expected to act as an  enabler for security, privacy and resilience in data collection, storage and management .  The European Union seems to be disadvantage d compared to China and the United States .120 As  outlined by the  Center for Data Innovation , ther e is no straightforward metric for measuring the  relative amount of data available for AI in a particular place . One  estimation  approach is to consider  the percentage of the population engaging in digital activities that lead to the creation of large data  sets, such as broadband subscriptions and  mobile payments .121 These metrics for data availability  generally place the  European Union  either second or third when compared to China and the United  States . As discussed further in Section 5.3.2, one of the main challenges  for the  European Union  (aside  from its smaller population vs. China) is the fragmentation of the digital market across Member States ,  which prevents the cre ation of large , integrated data sets for training AI models. In the United States   the collection and management of data are  left to the private sector, with considerable concentration  in a few big techs; conversely , China combin es government surveillance w ith strong control by big  techs over massive amounts of data that are made available to Chinese AI developers.

   The EU and international ecosystems for AI and blockchain  49   Revealed comparative advantage (RCA) across AI domains     The study AI watch  – TES analysis of AI w orldwide ecosystem in 2009 –2018 provides interesting insights  into different countries ’ specialisation  in the field of AI.  It uses a thematic RCA indicator to measure each   country’s specialisation against  the world average in that area.122 An RCA  score >1 in a specific domain   indicates th at a country is relatively specialised therein.123    Europe demonstrates a particular comparative advantage in the thematic areas of Robotics and  Automation and of AI Services , with values of the RCA indicator above world benchmark s. Europe’s leading  position in robotics can be  partly explained  by its strong  and innovative industry . Regarding AI Services ,  Europe’s advantage may be explained by the strength of its  software industry, which has  grow n at five  times the rate of the rest o f the EU  economy.124    Another strong area for Europe is machine learning . Although its  RCA score of 0.9 does not reach the world  average, Europe  is among the top three performers globally, just below the benchmark of China (RCA  score  > 1). Connected and Auto mated vehicles are not among Europe’s relative specialisations, although in  number of patent applications, research publications and firms’ activities , Europe ranks third after only  China and the United States . Finally, while AI processing units were  not included in the  AI watch  analysis  the United States  is market leader in produc ing AI processing units, followed by Europe.125                                                                122 Note that the domain “AI processing units” is not included in this study’s analysis.   123 Note this analysis is based on the EU28: it was conducted before the United Kingdom left the European Union.   124 The State of Europea Tech.

   The investment gap for AI and blockchain  51 4. The investment gap for AI and blockchain   The analysis outlined in the previous section shows that the total, average and median venture  capital  investments in AI and blockchain are lower in the EU27 than in the United States  and China.  Several factors might be driving this difference ( e.g. market characteristics  and size; appetite for AI and  blockchain  investments); these are investigated in S ection  5. This section  presents a simple analysis of  the investment gap in the EU27. Rather than precise ly calculati ng granular investment demand and  supply components, the section provides  approximations  based on compari sons  between Europe  and other relevant ge ographies . The aim is to compute the level of equity and debt investments  required for the European Union to attain the levels of the United States  and China.   Figure 27: AI and blockchain SMEs seeking  external financing (SME survey results)     The study identified an annual  investment gap for  EU27 -based AI and blockchain SMEs of about €5 – 10 billion . In line with the results of the survey and interviews, most of th is gap is attributable to equity.  Only a  small percentage (10 –20%) is attributable to debt, particularly  venture debt, which emerged  from the survey as a preferred form of debt for AI and blockchain  SMEs (especially in later life -cycle  stages).  In absolute values, AI SMEs account for the largest  part of the equity gap (70 –80% , compared  with 20 –30% for blockchain  SMEs ). In relative values, the equity gap for AI SMEs is up to four times the  value of current investments, while the equity gap for blockchain  SMEs amounts to about 10 –15 times  the value  of current investments. Most of the equity gap is in the introduction stage ( Series A and B,  ~47%) and in the growth stage ( Series C onwards , ~35%).

   The investment gap for AI and blockchain  53 4.1. Equity investment gap   The study triangulated results across  two different approaches to estimate the total equity  investment gap for AI and blockchain SMEs in Europe :  1. A bottom -up approach, which calculates the 2019 delta in median venture capital investmen ts in  AI and blockchain  SMEs in the United States  and EU27 ( using Preqin ) and multiplies this difference  by the total number of AI and blockchain  SMEs in the EU27 (using Crunchbase ). The study  computed th e investment gap  at aggregate level and split by financing life -cycle  stage . This  approach is in line with that  deployed in previous EIB studies;127 and  2. A top-down approach, which calculates the required  venture capital investments to bring the  share in AI and blockchain  SMEs (as a proportion of total venture capital  investments ) to the same  level in the EU27 as in the United States  in 2019, and adjusts this value to reflect  the relative size  of the EU27 and US venture capital  markets.   Each approach highlights different components of the investment gap. Results deriving from the two  approaches are broadly consistent and give a good approximation of the size of the gap.   4.1.1.  Bottom -up approach  The bottom -up approach estimates the equity funding gap to be about €7.5 billion  – €6.4 billion  for  AI, €1.1 billion  for blockchain – calculated in two steps:   • In the first step, calculate the median venture capital investments for both geographies  (EU27 and  the US), and for both technologies ( AI and blockchain ), respectively; and   • In the second step, multiply the differences in median investment s for the two technologies by the  number of SMEs in the EU27 .                                                                   127 Feeding future generations  (2019) and Financing innovation in mobility  (2018).  
54 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Figure 30: Bottom -up approach: Median equity investment gap in the EU27 vs. the United States   (aggregate)128    Note: Calculated in $, converted into €.     In absolute terms , AI SMEs account for most of  the equity gap. In relative terms , however, about 10  times the current blockchain  investments but only  about 2.5 times the current AI investments are  required to close the gap. The results do not change substantially when using alternative  reference  geographies and years, as shown in Table 6  and detailed further in Appendix D .129  Table 6: Sensitivity of bottom -up estimates to alternative reference geographies and years   Reference geography and year130 AI equity gap  Blockchain   equity gap  Total equity gap   United States  2018 vs. EU27 2018  €5.2bn €0.5bn €5.7bn  China 2019 vs. EU27 2019  €7.6bn €0.7bn €8.3bn  Germany 2019 vs. EU26 (excl. GER) 2019  - - €5.1bn    Using the same approach as above but differentiating between financing life -cycle stages, the study  estimates a total equity gap of €4.4 billion , 82% of which is in the introduction and growth stages.   The estimated equity gap is largest in the introduction stage (rounds A and B), both at the aggregate  EU27 level (€2.0 billion ) and as a percentage of missing funding at the level of individual SMEs (103%  of median investment). The second largest gap is in the growth stage (rounds C onwards) , total ling  about €1.6 billion . The estimated equity gap is smallest in the development stage (seed and angel ),  total ling about €0.8 billion . The 82% estimate is likely conservative considering that several EU- born                                                              128 Preqin data, Crunchbase data, Oliver Wyman analysis.

   The investment gap for AI and blockchain  55 SMEs have moved outside the  European Union  at the introduction and growth stages to get the  funding required to sustain their expan sion.  Figure 31: Bottom -up approach: Median equity investment gap in the EU27 vs. the United States  (by  life-cycle stage)131       Note: Calculated in $, converted into €.     4.1.2.  Top-down approach  The top-down approach estimates  an investment gap of €3.2 billion  – €2.7  billion  for AI, €0.5 billion   for blockchain . The AI share of total venture capital investment is about 1.2 times larger in the United  States  than in the EU27 (13.6% vs. 11.3% , respectively) , while the  blockchain  share is about 1.4 time s  larger in the United States  vs. the EU27 (1.0% vs. 0.7% , respectively). This suggests that, for  AI, the gap  is not driven by low willingness of venture capital  investors but rather by the smaller overall size of the  venture capita l market in Europe ( a common issue across several EU sectors) . By contrast , venture  capital investors’  appetite for blockchain  is significantly lower in the EU 27 than in the United States .  This topic is discussed in further detail in Section 5.1.3 .                                                              131 Preqin data, Crunchbase data, Oliver Wyman analysis.   
56 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  The results from the two approaches are in the same order of magnitude . The study triangulated  several different sources for the top -down approach to obtain estimates robust to the values of the  venture capital market in available studies.132, 133  Figure 32: Top -down approach: Median equity investment gap in the EU27 vs. the United Stat es  (aggregate)       4.2. Debt investment gap   As reported  in Figure 28, AI and blockchain SMEs strongly prefer equity to debt financing. Their most  preferred types of debt financing are direct public loans or subsidised loans ( particularly amid  the  COVID -19 pandemic, with several interviewed SMEs targeting dedicated resources from public support  schemes) and venture debt, a very relevant financing source for firms in later life -cycle stages. Except  for personal credit lines and/or credit card overdrafts, loans from traditional banks do not seem to be  favoured by  AI and blockchain  SMEs.   The study used two different approaches to estimate the total debt investment gap for AI and blockchain  SMEs in Europe.  The first approach focuses only on  the venture debt gap, and thus  represents the lower bound of the debt investment gap range (the gap if AI and blockchain  SMEs only  need venture debt). The second approach includes a broader definition of debt (includ ing venture debt  and other types of loans) and could, thus , be considered the upper bound of the debt investment gap   range .  Specifically , the two approaches make the following  calculations :                                                              132 EU27 values are based on Preqin data (total venture capital investments in the sector). For US 2019, total venture capital   investments ($136.1 bil lion) is taken from the Venture monitor Q1 2020 (National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) &  Pitchbook, 2020) and the AI share ($18.5 billion) is based on data from the NVCA ( link, accessed 11 May 2020). Global  venture capital  investments in blockchain -related companies were reported to be $2.8 billion in 2019, while 51% of  blockchain investments globally in 2015 –2019 were made in the Un ited States ( The blockchain report 2020 , CB Insights,  2020). Accordingly, US venture capital  investments in 2019 were estimated to be $1.4 billion. For the US and EU27 GDP  size, OECD data were used.   133 Venture capital  investments in European AI companies in 2019 amounted to $4.9 billion, of which $2.9 billion was  invested in the United Kingdom: see State of tech 2019 report,  Atomico, 2019. The Crunchbase database reports venture  capital  investments in the EU27 of $21.7 billion in 2019 ( link, accessed 11 May 2020).   
   The investment gap for AI and blockchain  57 1. The venture debt approach calculates the required investment to increase the venture debt share  of total venture capital  investments to the same level in the EU27 as in the United States  in 2019,  and adjusts this value to reflect the relative size of the EU 27 and US venture capital market s as a  percentage of GDP; and   2. The SME debt gap approach assumes that the debt gap for SMEs is within the GDP range estimated  by McCahery  et al. (2015),134 and adjusts this value by the size of the “new technology” sector  (the  same approach used in previous EIB studies ).135  4.2.1.  The venture debt approach  In line with previous EIB studies, the survey and interviews revealed  that traditional senior loans to  highly innovative SMEs are rarely  economically viable for commercial banks.  Thus, typical bank loans  are not commonly used for start ing and scal ing up AI and blockchain  SMEs. More viable forms of debt  include  venture debt , which is being raised and is becoming more  popular  among  highly innovative  firms.136  The study estimates that the annual venture debt investment gap for AI and blockchain SMEs is  €0.2  – 1.6 billion . The gap was estimated b y analysing  the investments required to increase the  venture debt share of total venture capital investments to the same level in the EU27 as in the United  States  in 2019 , adjusted for the relative size of the EU and US venture capital markets. In the first step,  EIB estimates were used to calculate the difference between the venture debt share of total venture  capital investments in the United States ( ~15% ) and the equivalent share in Europe ( only 5% ).137 By  multiplying this percentage difference (15%  − 5% = 10%) by the total annual venture capital   investments in AI and blockchain  in Europe (about €2.1 billion  in 2019), the lower bound estimate of  the annual venture debt gap is calculated as €0.2 billion .138 In the second step, based on the venture  capital market in AI and blockchain  being about eight  times larger in the United States  than  in the EU27,  the upper bound estimate of the venture debt gap is calculated as €1.6 billion  (i.e. €0.2 billion  × 8).139  Thus, the estimated  annual venture debt gap of  the EU27 is €0.2– 1.6 billion .  4.2.2.   The SME debt gap approach  As a n alternative  approach  to calculating the debt investment gap, the study also uses  the SME debt  gap method  deployed in several previous EIB studies.140 This approach estimates the debt  investment gap for AI and blockchain SMEs in the EU27 to be €1.3– 2.8 billion  per year. As the first  step, the debt gap for all SMEs is assumed to lie within 2.7% and 6.0% of GDP, as estimated by  McCahery  et al. (2015).141 The AI/blockchai n share of EU27 GDP is then estimated using  the share of  the “new technology ” within the information and communications technology  sector. Finally, the  range of the SME debt gap is applied to this GDP share estimate.  The c alculations are shown in  Figure  33. Since “new technology ” is not limited to AI and blockchain , the results obtained from this approach  can be considered an upper bound for the SME debt investment gap. Also, while McCahery  et al. (2015)  base d their estimates on all SMEs in the economy , AI and blockchain  SMEs tend to have low er need                                                              134 McCahery, Lopez de Silanes, Schoenmaker & Stanisic, 2015.   135 For example, Feeding future generations  (2019) and Financing innovation in clean and sustainable mobility  (2018).   136 Financing the deep tech revolution: How investors assess risks in key enabling technologies (KETs) , EIB, 2018.   137 EIB calculations ( link, accessed 20 May 2020); see also The shortage of risk capital for Europe’s high growth businesses ,  AFME, 2017.   138 For simplicity and based o n available data, the delta % of venture debt / venture financing is considered as 10% of venture  capital investments.   139 Total venture capital  investment in 2019: $2.1 billion in the European Union vs. $20.0 billion in the United States.   140 Feeding future g enerations  (2019); Financing innovation in mobility  (2018).   141 McCahery, Lopez de Silanes, Schoenmaker & Stanisic, 2015.

Available EU programmes for AI and blockchain     The European Commission has taken several measures to sustain the development and deployment  of AI and blockchain technologies in Europe.  The AI strategy presented in April 2018 targeted   increased coordination and synergy of investments, with public (EU and national) and private  investments in AI research and innovation  (R&I)  reaching at least €20 billion from 2018 until the end  of 2020 , then over €20 billion  per year throughout  the following decade.143  At the EU  level, the European Commission plans to dedicate funds in the form of grants and  guarantees for AI and blockchain across several programmes of the next long -term EU budget 2021 – 2027.144  • Digital Europe Programme: The Programm e focuse s on building the strategic digital capacities of  the European Union  and on facilitating the wide deployment of digital technologies  for use by  Europe ’s citizens and businesses. The planned overall budget is €8.2 billion , of which:   – €2.5 billion  will be specifically dedicated to investing in and opening up the use of AI by  businesses and public administrations, facilitating safe access to and storage of large sets of  data and algorithms, and strengthening and supporting existing AI testing and                                                              142 McCahery, Lopez de Silanes, Schoenmaker, & Stanisic, 2015; Eurostat; IDC ( link, accessed 11 May 2020).   143 Coordinated plan on AI , European Commission, 2018.   144 European Commission ( link, accessed 19 May 2020); MFF Factsheets.

The Commission  is willing to  reinforce focus on AI and blockchain  technologie s via this programme ( supplementing the   €1.5  billion  for investments in AI under the R&I framework of Horizon 2020 ).  • InvestEU Programme:  This p rogramme builds on the successful model of the Investment Plan for  Europe (the Juncker Plan). It will bring toget her the European Fund for Strategic Investments and  13 EU financial instruments. InvestEU will include an EU budget guarantee of ~€75  billion  for  financing investment projects via the EIB G roup and national promotional banks  to support longterm green and digital transition s. The funds are expected to be split as follows: R &I (€10 billion ),  SMEs ( €10 billion ), Social Investments and Skills (€3.6 billion ), Strategic EU Investments  (€31  billion ) and Sustainable Infrastructure ( €20 billion ).  Additional EU -level financing will be provided as indirect equity investments through the EIF AI and  blockchain investment scheme.  This programme was launched in early 2020 with the objective of  financ ing the development of highly innovative AI and blockchain  companies , as part of a wider move  to create a dynamic EU- wide innovation ecosystem.     The EIF AI/ blockchain  investment scheme – key facts     • Programme size:  €100 million , to be approved for selected investments by Dec ember  2020, enabling a  portfolio of ~ 4–8 funds and co -investments in AI/ blockchain -related technologies   • Tools:  New direct fund investments and co -investments , alongside existing EIF fund managers and  business angels   • Fund strategies:  AI and blockchain  technologi es-focused funds or generalist funds with an opportunistic  focus on these areas (required to invest at least double  the programme allocation in AI/blockchain )  • Investment in a single fund:  up to € 50 million  (min. 7.5% and max. 50% of the fund)   • Targeted final beneficiaries:  SMEs developing or operating in the field of AI or blockchain   • Stage focus:  early, expansion and growth      These EU-level investments are complemented by national efforts and initiatives . In response to the  European Commission’s Coordin ated plan on AI , many Member States have published national AI  strategies  and announced public funding to implement the se strategies. Among the largest public  investment plans are  those of :  • the German federal government , which committed  in 2018 to spend ar ound €3 billion  during   2019– 2025;145  • the French government , which  will dedicate €1.5 billion  to develop ing AI by the end of 2022,  including €700 million for research;146  • the Italian government , which  earmark ed around €1 billion  until 2025;147 and                                                              145 Germany AI Strategy Report.

Examples of public initiatives in AI and blockchain  from the United States  and China     The review of US and Chinese public programme s provide s useful illustrations .  In 2019 President Trump launched the American AI Initiative, a strategy for promoting American leadership  in AI.  The MIT Technology Review  reports that , as part of this strategy , the US federal government alone  planned to spend a total of $5.9 billion  on AI R&D  in 2020, comprising $4.9 billion  on defence and $1 billion   on non -defence programmes (the latter being  expected to grow to $2 billion  by the end of 2022).150 The U S  Department of Defense had already announced (in 2018) a $2 billion  five-year campaign led by the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for AI technologies, called “AI Next .”151 Moreover, the 2020  National Arti ficial Intelligence Initiative Act allocates  another $6.5 billion  to AI research and development  (R&D), education and standards development. I nitiatives include , for example,  setting up a national cloud  computing task force and establishing AI networking security.152    While US government spending on blockchain  is still much lower than that devoted to  AI, studies predict  considerable growth over the coming  years.153 Also, several g overnment agencies are exploring potential  applications of blockchain  in their domain, including the United States Agency for International Development,  the Centre for Disease Control and the Department of Defense.154    China ’s central government presented th e New generation AI d evelopment plan in 2017, which aims to  make  China the world leader in AI. The strategy calls for extensive investments in R&D and other initiatives  from government bodies and private entities , though the values  are difficult to estimate based on publicly  available data.155 China’s public R&D spending on  AI is estimated to be no more than $10 billion  per year,156  while the amount spent  by central government is estimated by some studies to be as low as a few hundred  million US dollar s.157 However, when also considering financing by local authorities, state -owned enterprises  and other players  close to the government, as well as other forms of support for  AI (e.g. public equity  investment, loans and tax breaks) , overall  support for AI by the Chinese government appears  substantial.                                                                    148 Netherlands AI Strategy Report.

   The investment gap for AI and blockchain  61 4.4. Alternative investment schemes based on blockchain   Blockchain technology allows firms to use alternative investment schemes (beyond equity and debt)  to raise financing; initial coins offerings  (ICOs ) are probably the most common blockchain- based  investment scheme.  ICOs allow companies to raise funds with digital assets (tokens), created using  distributed ledger technology .158 They are often considered a cryptocoin -based version of traditional  initial public offerings (IPOs). ICOs are mechanisms for companies to:   • Access new funding sources without necessarily giving away any equity and  control;   • Simplify asset d istribut ion; and   • Access a broader investor universe than is typically available to  early -stage  firms.   In the ICO process , fundraisers issue newly denominated tokens and sell them to investors at an  initial rate, in exchange for conventional currency or established cryptocoins (e.g.  Ethereum).  Tokens  do not necessarily imply any owners hip/equity in the company, although they can be designed to have  aspects of securities, if desired. The issuer then uses the capital raised to meet development costs/fund  future operations or acquisitions , as they would following an IPO. The purchasers are  free to trade the  tokens on exchanges or hold them for future use on the  platform. The price is largely driven by  the  token’s  “utility ” or “underlying value ,” i.e. demand for the coin as a unit of value on the platform itself  and performance of the underlying value . ICOs  originated in the payment and utility token space  as a  means  to fund specific technologies/projects ; only recently have  they been used to fund  investments  in equity and physical commodities. ICOs  currently face significantly lower barriers to entry than IPOs  and target different issuers/investors with different products and regulations.   Figure 34: Six key steps of the  ICO process159    Between January 2016 and December 2019 a total of $ 14.6 billion  was raised through ICOs globally .  ICO activity peaked at the end of 2017 and continued strongly in the first half of 2018. W ith a global  volume of $7.8 billion  raised across 1  253 ICOs (average ICO size of $ 6.2 million ), blockchain  firms  globally raised considerably more fund ing via ICOs than via “traditional” equity investments  ($4.1 billion ) in 2018.160 However, global ICO activity dramatic ally decline d by year end 2018, and the re                                                              158 Autonomous NEXT analysis; WePower white paper; Oliver Wyman analysis.   159 ico4you.com , Oliver Wyman analysis.   160 ICOdata.io ( link, accessed 25 May 2020).   
62 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  was very little activity in 2019 , with 109 ICOs rais ing just $0.4 billion , representing a 95% year -on-year  decline. In terms of timing, this pattern is similar to that for venture capital equity investments in  blockchain , which also  peak ed in 2018 then dropped significantly  in 2019.161  Figure 35: Funds raised through ICOs, January 2016 – December 2019 ($ billion )162    Figure 36: Token -offering activity by top  10 country and industry, Jan.  2017 –October 2018163    Globally,  there is a trend among regulators to advance regulation of the crypto finance ecosystem,  but no international agreement on the categori sation of ICOs in terms of existing regulation.164, 165 In  the European Union , most M ember States have not implemented dedicated regulation for blockchain based investment schemes; among the few countries where  dedicated regulation is already  implemented or in progress  are Malta, Liechtenstein and France.   There are alternatives available to ICOs,  based on a very similar approach.  One alternative is i nitial  exchange offerings (IEOs) , which main ly differ  from  ICOs by introducing an intermediary into the  process , with tokens of the issuing startup sold through a crypto exchange , rather than  directly to  investors  (as in ICOs) . Another alternative is security token offerings (STOs), in which tokens are                                                              161 ICOdata.io ( link, accessed 25 May 2020).   162 ICOdata.io ( link, accessed 25 May 2020).   163 Token offerings: A revolution in corporate finance, The Capco Institute Journal of Financial Transformation, 2 019.   164 5th ICO / STO report, PwC, 2019.   165 Initial coin offerings –  too soon or too late? , CFA Institute, 2019.

There is growing  interest among investors in tokeni sed real- world assets entering the traditional investment universe ,  offering  a more advanced technological solution. In fact, STOs are classified as securities and so  generally subject to regulation by a financial market supervisory authority.166, 167  A recent OECD study shows that blockchain- based investment schemes can contribute to enhancing  access to finance for SMEs. These schemes  potentially offer access to a large pool of potential investors ,  without intermediaries such as banks , often at a lower cost than traditional financin g options. Figure  38 presents a  comprehensive overview of the benefits of ICOs for SMEs. Risks and challenges around  ICOs entail regulatory uncertainty, the structuring of token offerings, investor protection, corporate  governance , and regulatory compliance and operational and business risks.168  Figure 37: Benefits of ICOs for SMEs169                                                                     166 What is the current regulatory status of STOs at EU level.

   Bottlenecks in AI and blockchain  financing 65 5. Bottlenecks in AI and blockchain  financing   Access  to finance does  not only concern the  availability of capital  – it encompasses the whole  innovation ecosystem.  As summarised  in Figure  39, access -to-finance conditions for the deployment  of AI and blockchain  technologies are assessed by analysing :  • The demand side , where it is critical that SMEs have the right talent to push innovation, produce  high -quality research and development (R&D), and scale up their products in a unified digital  market;   • The supply side , in which stakeholders that provid e financing need to have sufficient availab le  capital to invest, possess  the ri ght tools to assess complicated technologies, and be willing to invest  in those  technologies ;  • In between them, the market matching system , which needs to bring together SMEs and investors  to benefit all parties involved. This includes marketing efforts, jo int product and proposition  developments, and pricing mechanisms; and   • The extent to which all three are included in an integrated innovation ecosystem , where all  stakeholders of the innovation value chain can cooperate in a coordinated manner. This include s  government initiatives playing a central role in defining strategy  and in  prioritising and enabling  the cooperation among key players  of the ecosystem.   Figure 38: Framework for the analysis of AI and blockchain SMEs’ access -to-finance conditions170    The rest of this section will focus on the highlighted dimensions of the framework, reporting  the key  findings of this study’s analysis  (as outlined in the Executive Summary ).  5.1. Supply  side  5.1.1.  Volume   Despite the large increase i n AI and blockchain investments over recent years ( approximately  tenfold  rise from  2016 to 2019), the limited availability of venture capital  funding remains a key issue in   Europe.   The funding volume provided by the venture capital market to AI and blockchain  SMEs is considerably  smaller in the EU27 ($2.1  billion  annually  / €1.75  billion ) than in  the United States  ($20 billion  /  €16 billion ) and China  ($5 billion  - €4 billion ) (see Section 4.1.1 ).

66 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  exhibit high  average and median equity investments in AI and blockchain  SMEs. On both of these  metrics, the European Union  is ranked fifth behind  Canada and the United Kingdom . The median  investment is significantly lower than the average across geography and years, which suggests that  there are few very large investments in late -stage SMEs  across all regions .  “There are plenty of opportunities venture capital  funds cannot take because of the lack of funds”   - Venture capital fund   Figure 39: Average estimated venture capital  equity investment in AI and blockchain  SMEs by  international geography , 2015 –2019171    Figure 40: Median estimated venture capital  equity investment in AI and blockchain SMEs by  international geography , 2015 –2019172    As several interviews revealed , one explanation for  the lower availability of venture capital   investments in Europe is the fact that European venture capital funds  are mostly financed by  government agencies, family offices and corporate investors; by contrast , large institutional  investors – which can typically deploy larger cheques –  do not contribute as much as in the United  States . As Figure 41  shows , the largest contributors to venture capital funds in Europe were  government agencies (24%), family offices  and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs, 19%), and                                                              171 Preqin data (only deals with disclosed amounts), Oliver Wyman analysis.   172 Ibid.   
   Bottlenecks in AI and blockchain  financing 67 corporate investors (17%). While family offices  and HNWIs also play a significant role in the Unit ed  States  (contributing about 17% of total venture capital funds), government agencies and corporate  investors there make much smaller contributions (10% and 5% , respectively). Notably, the public  sector ’s role  in financing the venture capital  market is mu ch larger (at least in relative terms) in Europe  than in the United States . Pension funds are the largest source of venture capital funds in the United  States  (20% vs. 8% in Europe) , while  academic institutions, endowments and foundations also play a  much larger role ( 13% vs. 6% in Europe ). According to a recent survey, the structure of venture capital  sources does not seem to have changed recently: European venture capital funds  reported   experienc ing rising interest from family offices , corporates and  sovereign wealth funds, but a drop in  already low interest from pension funds and endowments.173  “The l argest investors in US venture capital funds  are pension funds, endowments, insurance  companies – this is very limited in the EU and it is a major competi tive disadvantage”   - Venture capital fund   Figure 41: Venture capital  funding  raised by limited partner  type and region (% of total funding   raised )174      The investors most  actively contributing to venture capital  funds in Europe ( government agencies  and family offices ) mostly invest in smaller venture capital  funds. Figure 4 2 shows the distribution of  venture capital fund ing raised by fund size and limited partner ( LP) type.  Academic institutions,  pension funds, funds -of-funds and c orporate investors exhibit  a clear tendency to invest in large funds  (over €250 million  in size), whereas  family offices  and HNWIs, as well as g overnment agencies , tend to  invest in smaller funds (below €100  million  in size ).                                                                173 State of European tech 2019 , Atomico, 2019.   174 State of European tech 2017 , Atomico, 2017.

68 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Figure 42: Venture capital  funding  raised by fund size and LP type (%)175    The limited role played in Europe by large institutional investors such as pension funds, insurers and  endowments might be a main driver behind the large equity investment gap at later s tages of the  financing life  cycle. As Section 4.1 illustrated , the EU27 equity gap occurs mostly in the later stages  (Series  A onwards ), where larger amounts of capital are required. As large institutional investors  typically deploy larger amounts of capital, their limited role may significant ly disadvantage European  SMEs seeking  to raise funds in Europe. The EIF has established the  Asse t Management Umbrella Fund  (AMUF) to offer a structure for i nstitutional Investors to invest in European venture capital funds .  Moreover, the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator was created to help SMEs developing   high -risk, high -impact technolog ies to bring their products to the market and scale up their ideas.176  The limited presence of institutional investors in Europe can be explained by two main factors.177  First, the risk–return profile of venture capital  investments is perceived as unattractive  in Europe  compared to the United States  (due to lower GDP growth, high er debt -to-GDP ratio, lower investment  liquidity and less efficient legal systems  in the EU27 overall). Second,  there are  internal limitations  related to institutional investors’ investment policies, such as the minimum ticket/fund size and the  lack of a target for allocation to venture capital  (somewhat related to the lack of venture capital specialist  teams).   Corporate inv estors play an important role as sources of capital in the European venture capital   system.  In 2019 corporate venture capital (CV C)-backed funding to AI startups reached an all -time high  of $10.6 billion  globally (+70% vs. 2018) . As Figure 43  shows, the  average size of global CVC -backed  deals in AI doubled  from  2014  to 2019. In 2019 Europe accounted for ~16% of global number of CVC backed AI deals (see Figure 45 ). On average, EU CVC deals across all sectors amounted to about 46%  the size of US CVC deals ($12.3 million  vs. $26.2 million , respectively). While the same granularity of  data is not available for blockchain , CVC-backed deals represent ed 20% of the value of all blockchain                                                               175 State of European tech 2017 , Atomico, 2017.

From 2000 to 2019,  there were only 139 acquisitions of AI companies in the EU28 countries , compared to 526 in the United  States  (only  9 in China). In 2019 all ten of the world’s leading corporates  in AI company acquisitions  were US -based .                                                                 178 The blockchain report 2020 , CB Insights, 2020.   179 The 2019 global CVC report , CB Insights, 2020.   180 The 2019 global CVC report , CB Insights, 2020.

US companies account for about 44% of European startup acquisitions.182 Also, a significant  proportion of European startups have moved their headquarters abroad , particularly among those  raising higher amount s of capital: it is estimated that  one in seven startups raising $10–100 million  has  relocated its headquarter s outside Europe , compared to one in four startups rais ing over  $100 million .183  “Origination and see d are relatively well developed in the EU. SMEs do seed and angel in the EU, then  they go to the US and grow their financial network there”   - Venture capital fund   Another factor potentially  constraining  within -EU exit opportunities for AI and blockchain  investments is the limited value of IPOs within the  European Union. While there are  currently little  data on AI and blockchain  IPOs, th is study analysed  the value of IPOs  in “Computer & Electronics”: in  2019 the United States  was the leading country (note  that three IPOs account ed for more than 50% of  the total : Uber, Pinterest and Lyft); China rank ed second and the EU27 third (with a value less tha n  one-fourth of that in the United States ).  Figure 45: Global value of “Computer & E lectronics” IPOs in 2019 ($ billion )184    Interviewees often mentioned t he limited within -EU exit opportunities as a main driver behind  several European- born AI and blockchain firms being sold to extra- EU investors after initial financing  stages . When this happens, these European firms can no longer promote  long -term EU  competitiveness and help spread the benefits of digital transformations across industries and countries  within the  European Union .  “SMEs tend to move to other, more developed market s (e.g. US) after initial rounds when they grow  and need more capital (or as soon as they can afford it)”   - SME                                                               181 Who is winning the AI race: China, the EU or the United States? , Center for Data Innovation, 2019.   182 Startup transatlantic M&As US vs. EU, Mind the Bridge and Crunchbase, 2016.   183 Move to Silicon Valley vital for ambitious European tech groups.

   Bottlenecks in AI and blockchain  financing 71 5.1.2.  Specialisation   Compared to the United States , there are fewer venture capital  investors specialised in AI and  blockchain in the  European Union.   Recent years have seen the emergence of several AI-  and blockchain -specialist venture capital funds  in the United States . US blockchain  funds raised over  $2 billion  in the past decade  – more than four   times the total of blockchain  investments in the EU27. These funds are typically equipped with highly  experienced engineering teams, which support due diligence and offer  portfolio companies relevant  technical support to develop and scale  up their products. Some notable examples of specialised US  blockchain  funds are listed in Table 8:  note that this list is not exhaustive and excludes  a number of  smaller, specialised blockchain  venture capital funds that also play key role s in the US market.   Table 8: Capital raised by blockchain  vent ure capital  funds ( notable examples )  Fund  Capital raised   Paradigm  $400 m185  Andreessen Horowitz  $865 m in two funds186  Polychai  $175 m; plus new round of  $200m  as of May 2019187  Pantera Capital  $470 m; plus new round as of May 2019188    AI- and blockchain- speciali st funds are smaller and less common in the  European Union. Of the  survey ed SME s, 17 –18% identified the lack of technical expertise among  investors as the most  important constraint on accessing  financ e in 2019 and 2020. The limited number of specialised ve nture  capital investors in the  European Union  may especially in hibit  the seed stage, where investments are  typically  more localised : AI and blockchain  SMEs may struggle to find local investors able to deploy the  knowledge required for such technical investments (especially if not located in a “hub city” for  innovations – see Figure 53 ). Interviewees identified r educed competition between venture capital  funds  and limited diversity of expertise as consequences of the low number of venture capital funds .  Both factors make it more difficult for SMEs to find investors.   “It is not just the money, it is also (or most importantly) the expertise that pushes growing AI  companies to go to the US”   - Venture capital fund                                                                  185 Coindesk ( link, accessed 19 May 2020).   186 Andreessen Horowitz aims to raise $450m for second cryptocurrency fund.

Willingness   Although AI is core to the investment strategies of many funds in  Europe, investors’ appetite is  lower  for blockchain initiatives.   Figure 47 shows the share of European venture capital funds  that have included in their portfolio an  investee in a specific industry , according to the 2019 EIF VC S urvey.189 While 76% of respondents have  already invested in at least one AI company , only 23% have invested in blockchain  (fourth lowest of  the 13 innovative industries  considered ). Deep technology , an area related to AI, had received  investments from 56% of respondents. Moreover, the results indicate that future venture capital   investmen ts will target companies in AI (87% of respondents) and d eep technology (72%)  more  than  those in blockchain  (51%). It is, nevertheless, notable that over 50% of the surveyed venture capital  funds  will consider investing in blockchain  in the future . In this  study’s interviews , it was often  explained  that while blockchain  is perceived as a very -early -stage technology, venture capital funds   will likely have a higher appetite to invest when it be comes  more mature and has solid use cases  outside the financial sector.   “The appetite for  AI is not lagging behind the  US or China in terms of strategies or  intentions,   but in terms of realisation”   - Venture capital fund                                                                  189 EIF VC Survey 2019,  based on responses to the question: “Does your current investment portfolio include an investee in  the area of … ?”   
   Bottlenecks in AI and blockchain  financing 73 Figure 47: Share of investors wit h investees  in specific industries ( EIC VC S urvey  results)190    The appetite for blockchain investment in Europe was hit by the drop in the cryptocurrency market  at the end of 2018, reflecti ng investors’ perception that this technology is mostly  appli cable in  financial services.  Globally , venture capital investments in blockchain  amounted to almost $3 billion   in 2019, a decline of about 27% compared to 2018. While this drop was  certainly caused by several  factors , one key issue according to interviewees  was the view taken by investors  that blockchain   technology is mostly suited to financial services and has little application in  other industries.   Figure 48: Total estimated venture capital  equity investment in blockchain SMEs , 2010 –2019191    “70–80% of the investors we met were just not interested in investing in b lockchain”   - SME                                                                  190 EIF VC Survey 2019,  based on responses to the question: “Does your current investment portfolio include an investee in  the area of … ?”   191 Preqin data, Oliver Wyman analysis.   
74 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  By contrast , the appetite for AI investments is high and growing in Europe, as AI  is truly seen as a  key enabling technology  with  appli cations  across all economic sectors.  A recent study revealed  a  significant premium in the valuation of AI companies compared to other software companies  (globally): AI companies receive d a median funding volume higher than that of other software  companies across all funding rounds , but especially  in the seed funding round  (over 60% higher) .192  The same study also found  that up to 40% of European startups claim ing to be AI companies show no  evidence that AI is a material component of their value proposition, the aim being to att ract more  funding.   Despite the perceived importance of AI, investors might still refrain from investing due to a number  of complexities related to this technology : (i) the business model requires higher upfront investments  in R&D; (ii) cash flows/commercial traction occur only at a later technological maturity stage , after  early adopters have tested the technologies;  and (iii) AI technologies need to be incorporated into  ready -to-use products/services with direct applicability, which takes time.   Figure 49: Median funding of AI companies vs. other software companies ($ million )193    European venture capital funds  prefer to invest in those AI firms capable of get ting quicker traction  in the market, whereas  global big tech corporates prefer to invest in those AI firms developing  horizontal, core technologies. About 90% of AI startups address a need in a specific vertical area  (whether a business function or sector) , leaving only about 10% developing core, horizontal AI  technologies (i.e. a sector -agnostic capability or platform).194 While core technology providers  represent only one-tenth of European AI startups, they attract one -fifth of equity investments.  According to the interview ees, this is drive n by global big tech corporates ’ extensive focus on  development and deployment of core AI technologies , due to their disruptive potential across many  industries. The extensive R&D budgets of these large corporates are, therefore,  mostly directed  towards horizontal, core techno logies (which typically also take longer to develop). European venture  capital funds  instead target companies developing  vertical technologies that directly focus on a specific  market need and typically have a shorter time -to-market (hence offer ing a more attractive risk profile ).                                                              192 The state of AI: Divergence 2019 , MMC Ventures, 2019, based on data from MMC Ventures, Beauhurst, Crunchbase,  Tracxn.   193 The state of AI: Divergence 2019 , MMC Ventures, 2019, based on data from MMC Ventures, Beauhurst, Crunchbase,  Tracxn.   194 The state of AI: Divergence 2019 , MMC Ventures, 2019, based on data from MMC Ventures, Beauhurst, Crunchbase,  Tracxn.

Market infrastructure   5.2.1.  Awareness and distribution  There is limited matching in Europe between SMEs and potential investors , making it difficult for   available capital in the market to reach the best projects .  According to the interview ees, several SMEs are struggling to connect with investors, especially in the  early life-cycle stages in which investments tend to be more localised in origin markets. In the study’s  survey, 29% of respondents highlighted the difficulty of finding the right investors in  2019 (see   Figure  50). Moreover, 25% of the respondents stated that they would benefit from initiatives  facilitating matching between SMEs and  investors across the  European Union  (second most -selected  option).   Figure 50: Preferred solutions for improv ing access  to finance (SME survey results)195    5.3. Demand  side  5.3.1.  R&D   The EU27 has more specialised researchers than the United States  and China, and typically produces  the most technology -related academic  research (see Section 3.3.1).  The European Union  also has  the  world’s largest pool of talent  in AI research , with an estimated  40 000 AI researche rs (vs. just under  30 000 in the United States  and just under 20  000 in China).196 Moreover, although very recently  supplanted by China, Europe led the way  in publi shing  AI-related research over the last two decades ,  with about 30% of global AI research published in the region in  2017.197                                                                 195 Responses to the question: ”What could be possible solutions to improve your access to finance?” (select up to three  answers).   196 Who is winning the AI race: China, the E U or the United States? , Center for Data Innovation, 2019.   197 Based on data from Artificial intelligence index report 2019 , Stanford University, 2019, based on data from Elsevier;  papers indexed in SCOPUS.   
76 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  “The genesis of core AI and b lockchain technologies comes to a large extent from academia: we need  to put in place pre -seed solutions to push academics to commercialise their ideas”   - SME   However, the share of corporate R&D spending is lower in the  European Union than in peer  region s.  Despite the recent growth in R&D investment by EU -based companies , they are being  outpaced by  their US and Chinese counterparts. Using R&D spending by software and computer services firms as  an indicator for corporate R&D spending on AI and blockchain , 62 of the t op 100 firms are in the United  States whereas only 13 are in Europe .198 In 2019, the total amount of R&D spending by software and  computer services firms among the global top 2  500 (by R&D spending) reached €70 billion in the  United States, compared to €9 bi llion in Europe .199 However, the lack of R&D spending in European  firms goes beyond the software and computer services sector. Taking into account all sectors of the  economy, the firms spending the most on R&D tend to be headquartered in non -EU countries. Fo r  example, only four of  the top 20 R&D spenders  are based in the  European Union  (all in Germany).   The comparatively low R&D spending by European large corporates might be one reason for  relatively few EU research projects becoming  economic use cases.  As seen in Section 5.1.3, large  corporates typically focus on companies developing core, horizontal technologies ( riskier but with   higher potential t o disrupt many industries) , whereas  venture capital funds  tend to focus on companies  addressing a specific vertical area (which can get quicker traction in the market). S everal interview ees  confirmed that  the limited role of European large corporates in R& D partly explains why many  European researche rs struggle to turn their research into economically viable projects. Given also that   European venture capital funds  tend to require profitability from very early life -cycle stages, the  transition from research to products/services is particularly challenging in Europe (sometimes termed  the “European Paradox”).200 To mitigate this barrier, the European Commission recently launched the  Enhanced EIC pilot201 to support top -class innovators, entrepreneurs, small companies and scientists  with innovative ideas and the ambition to scale up internationally . The pilot  brings together the parts  of Horizon 2020 that provide funding, advice and networking opportunities for those at the cutting  edge of innovation. It inclu des two programmes dedicated to different types of innovators:   • The Pathfinder programme , for radically new technologies emerging from collaborative research.  This provides grant funding of up to €4 million  (as well as additional coaching and mentoring  serv ices); and   • The Accelerator programme , for development and scaling- up of high -risk innovations by startups  and SMEs. It provides grant funding of up to €2.5 million  and an option for equity investment of  up to €15 million  (as well as additional coaching and  mentoring services, support for pitches with  venture capital funds /corporates, and other assistance ).  “We need to enable researchers from academia to feel comfortable and pursue commercial  application of their research”   - Venture capital fund                                                                  198 Who is winning the AI race: China, the EU or the United States? , Center for Data Innovation, 2019, based on data from The  2019 EU industrial R&D investment scoreboard , European Commission -  Joint Research Centre, 2019.   199 Who is winning the AI race: China, the EU or the United States? , Center for Data Inn ovation, 2019, based on data from The  2019 EU industrial R&D investment scoreboard , European Commission -  Joint Research Centre, 2019.   200 Innovation - How to convert research into commercial success story?

Digital market   While Europe ’s domestic market is comparable in size (GDP) to the United States  and China, its  incomplete  integrat ion limit s the ability of AI and blockchain SMEs to scale up and compete in the  global market.   US tech companies can benefit from a large, fully integrated domestic market , while  Chinese  companies can benefit from domestic protection  against competition from  foreign companies, which  allows them to scale up as needed. By contrast, European companies need to operate across several,  not fully integrated markets. Beyond the most common areas disadvantag ing European companies  (e.g. the language barriers across M ember States), two are particularly relevant to AI and blockchain :  data and regulation.   Limited  availability of data   Data are a key enabler for disruptive technologies such as AI and blockchain . For AI companies,  datasets are key to train ing their models, grow ing, and compet ing in the global market; large amounts  of data help them develop highly acc urate models to recognise patterns in large databases and                                                              202 The 2019 EU industrial R&D investment scoreboard , European Commission, 2019.

78 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  perform several tasks. blockchain  is less reliant  than AI  on the availability of data and may act as an  enabler for security, privacy and resilience in data collection and management . Moreover, bloc kchain   could support the establishment of open, decentralised markets for data, AI models and other  resources for AI development.204  As Section 3.3.3 discussed , Europe is lagging behind the United States  and China in data  availability  and the possibility of connect ing cross- country databases. The European Commission has identified  several s pecific factors preventing the European Union  from realising its full potential in the data  economy.205 According to the Commission , the insufficient availability of data is especially related to  limited sharing across stakeholders, includ ing business use of  public sector information; the sharing  and use of privately  held data by other companies; the use of privately  held data by government  authorities; and the sharing of data between public authorities. Imbalances in market power also constrain  data accessibility, particularly for European SMEs. Data are  often accumulated by large  corporates and online platforms, with limited access for smaller companies . In this context, it is  essential that large corporates allow  AI product/service SMEs to access the ir data , thereby enabling  the full potential of AI technologies in Europe  to be exploited .  Another challenge is that  a very small number of big tech firms outside the European Union hold a  large part of the world’s data. 206 The US private sector is fr ee to dominate  the collection and  management of data , resulting in  considerable concentration in only a few big techs. Meanwhile, China  combin es government surveillance with strong control of b ig tech companies with  massive amounts  of data. In Europe, data cannot become concentrat ed among  only a few corporations because of EU  regulations and  the current structure of the digital market.   This situation could disincentiv ise data -driven businesses from  emerg ing, grow ing and innovat ing in  the European Union, now and in the future.  The volume of data produced in the world is growing  rapidly, from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to an expected 175 zettabytes in 2025: if properly captured, this growing amount of available data could bring major opportunities for data- driven AI innovation across  all economic sector s. 207 Furthermore, the way in which data are stored and processed will change  dramatically over the coming years: as stated by the European Commission , “today 80% of the  processi ng and analysis of data takes place in data centres and centralised computing facilities, and  20% in smart connected objects, such as cars, home appliances or manufacturing robots, and in  computing facilities close to the user (‘edge computing’); by 2025 t hese proportions are likely to be  inverted .”208 This trend presents  increasing possibilities for companies to develop innovative ways of  managing data, e.g. via blockchain . Firms and countries with vast access to data (now and in the future )  have a competitive advantage in  the development and deployment of AI - and blockchain -based  solutions, and it is essential  that the European Union  is well position ed to capture the benefits.   The European Commission has recogni sed the importance of data fo r the future of the European  economy , and articulated the aspiration to be a role model as  a society powered by data to make  better decisions.  The Commission proposes a four -pillar strategy :209  • A cross-sectoral governance framework  for data access and use , cover ing new EU mechanisms and  guidance on data sharing;   • Investments  in data and strengthening of the  European Union ’s capabilities and infrastructure  for  hosting, processing and using data, and fostering interoperability ;  • Building competencies  through greater investment in digital skills and in SMEs ; and                                                               204 See also Section 3.3.3.   205 Communication on a European strategy for data,  European Commission, 19 February 2020.   206 Ibid.   207 The digitization of the world from edge to core , IDC, 2018.   208 Communication on a European strategy for data,  European Commission, 19 February 2020.   209 Ibid.  
   Bottlenecks in AI and blockchain  financing 79 • Develop ing common European data spaces  in strategic sectors and domains of public interest.   Evolving regulatory landscape   The use of AI and blockchain brings opportunities and risks. These tech nologies can help increase  economic  productivity, and help solve several of the European Union’s  strategic priorities around  healthcare, climate and agriculture. However, they could also have unintended effects on society,  potentially result ing in unethica l outcomes or be ing used for malicious purposes (see Section 6 for a  more detailed discussion o f the societal and ethical impact of AI and blockchain  technologies).   To mitigate these risks, the European regulatory landscape for AI and blockchain has evolved quickly.  Since 2014 the  European Union  has implemented several regulations to facilitate and regulate the  development of data -intensive industries  such as  AI and b lockchain . These measures include:   • the Regulation on the free flow of non -personal data;210  • the Cybersecurity Act;211  • the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive;212  • the Open Data Directive;213 and  • the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).214  Regulatory involvement  will likely increase in the future as AI and blockchain are increasingly  deployed in “high -risk” areas  such as transport, healthcare, defence and  public services . Such  deployments must be governed by clear rules regarding safety, legal liability, and protection of rights.   With respect to AI, the European Commission  has identified seven non -binding requirements that will  need to be addressed to create a t rustworthy EU AI ecosystem.215 These include (see Section 6  for the  whole framework):   1. Human agency and oversight;   2. Technical robustness and safety;   3. Privacy and data governance;   4. Transparency;   5. Diversity, non -discrimination and fairness;   6. Societal and environmental well- being; and   7. Accountability.   While several requirements are already reflected in existing legal or regulatory regimes, others (i.e.  those regarding transparency, traceability and human oversight) are not specifically covered under  current legislation in many  economic sectors. E ven for those requirements covered by existing  regulations, certain aspects of AI can make the application and enforcement of this legislation more difficult; this further complicates the AI landscape in the  European Union .  Member States already recognise  the absence of a common European framework on these topics. 216  It is crucial to have common European standards to avoid cross -border uncertainties and the potential  for arbitrage by innovators in the field of data- driven technologies.  Without an EU -wide approach,                                                              210 Shaping Europe’s digital future. Free flow of non- personal data.

80 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  there is a risk of fragmentation in the EU domestic digital market, which would undermine the  objectives of trust, legal certainty and market uptake. Any regulations should be limited to clearly identified problems for which feasible solutions exist. It should also be clear which of these requirements apply to blockchain  as well.   The European Commission proposes a risk -based approach to determine the scope of applicable AI  regulation s and restrictions. 217 The risk level would dep end on the sector and the intended use of the  technology. Using a risk -based approach should help prioritise regulatory focus and avoid  overburden ing AI developers and service providers : for example, many of this study’s interviewe es  asserted that the GDPR  might prevent Europe from catch ing up with the United States  and China by  limiting the availability of large pools of data for  train ing AI models. In practice, however, it might be  difficult to set clear boundaries  for what should be considered higher or lower risk.   Economies of scale derived from concentration, integration, and proximity of talent and financing are the bas es for successful innovation ecosystems like Silicon Valley. Fully joined -up “ecosystems”  create powerful feedback loops between public  sector support, large corporates (as “clients” for  innovative projects), research institutions and private sector investors. 218 They provide significant  benefits for SMEs as well as the overall economy , and can enable  step -change s in the quality and  coordin ation of business and operational support for innovative companies as they evolve through  their life  cycle. As recogni sed in the recent European Commission  White paper on artificial intelligence ,  efforts at European, national and regional levels should be coordinated to create an ecosystem of  excellence along the entire innovation value chain. This means creating connected, specialised  innovation clusters where universities, SMEs, large corporates, investors, the public sector and all  other stakeholders are in close proximity and fully cooperat e with one an other. Different clusters  across the  European Union  should focus on different research priorities (e.g. healthcare, climate and  digital identity), avoiding overlaps and dispersion of efforts; in vestments should be directed where the  best opportunities  are located . While the European Commission  paper focuses on AI, the same  conditions should hold for blockchain .  The European landscape appears to comprise several non- interconnected and non- speciali sed  centres of AI and blockchain innovation.  Four countries account for as much as 55% of all European  AI and blockchain  SMEs, in line with their share of total EU GDP (Germany, France, Spain and the  Netherlands). Another  eight countries each have over 40 AI/blockchain  SMEs , while the remaining  Member States have few AI /blockchain  SMEs. While most countries have significantly more  AI SMEs   than blockchain  SMEs , the opposite is true for Estonia, Luxemburg, Malta, Slovenia, Cyprus and Croatia,  which have  emerged  as relatively small centres focused on blockchain . Notably , there has been  significant government support for blockchain  technology in in Estonia, Luxemburg and Malta,  which  might have contributed to this specialisation (see Section 2.2.4).                                                               217 Ibid.   218 Financing the deep tech revolution: How investors assess risks in key enabling technologies (KETs) , EIB, 2018.

Paris and Berlin are the largest hubs for AI and blockchain  in the EU27 , followed by  Amsterdam, Barcelona and Madrid with over 40 AI and blockchain  SMEs each. Except for Spain, where  Barcelona and Madrid each account for about 30% of total Spanish AI and blockchain  SMEs, all other  cities in the top 10 host  more than 50% of all AI and blockchain  SMEs in their respective countr ies. This  means that one city in each EU country (usually the capital) hosts  most of that country’s  AI and  blockchain  SMEs; however, it also shows that each country has a long tail of SMEs scattered across a  number of additional, smaller AI and blockchain  centres.   Figure 53: Top  10 EU27 cities for number of AI and blockchain SMEs , April 2020220    About 70% of total venture capital  investments in AI and blockchain since 2010 has been invested in  Germany and France; however, other large AI and blockchain centres do not receive investments in                                                              219 Crunchbase data, Oliver Wyman analysis.   220 Ibid.   
82 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  proportion to the number of SMEs they host . After  Germany and France , Belgium and Sweden rank  third  and fourth  respectively , receiving  roughly one-tenth of the level of venture capital  investments   in AI/ blockchain  in Germany; Ireland completes the top  5. Interestingly, Spain, the Netherlands and  Italy rank ninth , sixth, and thirteenth,  respectively despite ranking in  the EU27's top 5 countries for  number of AI and blockchain  SMEs (see Figure 5 2): this suggests  that venture capital  equity  investments are not allocated to some centres with the largest pools  of AI and blockchain  SMEs.  Despite Tallinn  being among the top  10 EU27 cities by number of AI/blockchain  SMEs (see Figure 5 3),  Estonia ranks very low  in total venture capital investments in these two technologies .  Figure 54: Total estimated venture capital  equity investment (and per $1 bn GDP in parenthesis) in  AI and blockchain SMEs by EU27 country , 2010 –2019221    Similarly, despite the large amount of technology -related academic research in some EU countries,  relatively few of these projects attract venture capital  equity investments and become economic use  cases.  Italy , Spain and Poland are among  the top  6 EU countries for AI -related paper output (1997 – 2017) , yet attract relatively little venture capital equity investment in this area.                                                                  221 Preqin data, Oliver Wyman analysis.

Despite a broad  range of financing schemes available to tech companies at the EU and Member State level, EU  initiatives are especially struggling to reach Eastern and Southern European c ountries, an issue picked  up by the Digital Innovation and Scale -up Initiative (DISC) recently launched by the European  Commission .223 Moreover, while there is an EU- wide coordinated plan for AI, each M ember State is  also pursuing its own strategy, with the risk of dispersing European resources and creating  inefficiencies . By contrast , only a few countries have devised their own strategies  for blockchain , while  other s have not yet taken a systematic approach to developing this technology. Public and private  resources are also not being channelled into creating big champions and investing in them throughout  all life-cycle stages  – especially for AI and blockchain , scaling is the key to success and a major  competitive advantage.  According to a recent EIF report,  the European innovation ecosystem is an  aggregation of several stakeholders ( venture capital funds  and others) that need to collaborate more  effectively  to foster better European integration.224  “Chinese and US investors focus on creating national champions and invest heavily i n those; EU  investments are very scattered”   - Venture capital fund                                                                    222 China AI development report , China Institute for Science and Technology Policy at Tsinghua University, 2018.   223 Shaping Europe’s digital future.

   Ethical and societal implications of AI and blockchain  85 6. Ethical and societal implications of AI and blockchain   AI technologies are expected to have a broad impact on some key ethical and societal goals of the  European Union.225 In its White paper on artificial intelligence , the European Commission  highlights  the potential positive impact of AI systems for European society, for example in achieving the SDGs,  supporting democratic process and social rights, and attaining the goals of the EU Green Deal.226  However, the Commission  also stresses that given the se technologies’  environmental impact, AI  systems need to be duly considered throughout their life  cycle and across the entire supply chain, for  example as regards resource usage for algorithm  training  and data storage.   AI technologies are also expect ed to change the everyday lives of European citizens in many ways  that we can only begin to imagine . They can potentially improve healthcare (e.g. diagnosis precision,  disease prevention), increase the efficiency of farming, contribute to climate change mi tigation and  adaptation, change way s of work ing across different sectors, and increase the security of Europeans .227  Regarding  the way we work, AI is expected to change industries across Europe by automating about  14% of jobs and significantly changing a further  32%.228 AI technologies also entail specific potential  risks, such as opaque decision -making, gender -based or other  kinds of discrimination, intrusion in to  private lives , and use for criminal purposes.229 Further potentially contentious  applications of AI  include identifying and tracking individuals ( e.g. to contain COVID -19), covert AI systems, AI- enabled  citizen scorin g (in violation of fundamental rights ) and lethal autonomous weapon systems.230  Despite the potential impact of AI on everyday lives, the technology has yet to overcome a range of  challenges . One key challenge is the limited accessibility of data for AI: as reflected in the COVID -19  crisis, where required data are  not yet available because of  limited collaboration between different  public and private stakeholders, algorithms may fail to produce the desired outcomes.231 To overcome  these technical limitations, i nnovators will have to conduct  their research ethically, transparently and  accountably to gain public trust and accelerate collaborative problem -solving (see a recent paper by  the Alan Tu ring Institute).232 A recent study conducted for the European Parliament found  five major  areas of ethical and societal challenges associated with the development and implementation of AI (see F igure 56).  Figure 56: Key areas of ethical dilemmas and moral questions related to AI 233                                                                225 White paper on Artificial Intelligence -  A European approach to excellence and trust , European Commission, 2020.   226 Communic ation:  Building trust in human- centric artificial intelligence , European Commission, April 2019.   227 Communication:  Building trust in human- centric artificial intelligence , European Commission, April 2019.   228 The risk of machine- learning bias (and how to prev ent it) , Oliver Wyman, 2018.   229 Communication: Building trust in human- centric artificial intelligence , European Commission, April 2019.   230 Ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI , High -Level Expert Group on AI (European Commission), 2019.   231 AI struggles to pro ve its worth in the face of COVID -19.

86 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  As a starting point for constructi ng “Trustworthy AI for Europe ,” the European Commission   addresses societal and ethical concerns related to AI in its recent Ethics guidelines for Trustworthy  AI.234 These guidelines are intended to be a living document that is  reviewed and updated over time  to ensure continu ing relevance as the technology, social environments and knowledge evolve. As the  AI landscape comprise s a diverse set of underlying technologies, use ca ses and stakeholders –  each  present ing its own opportunities and challenges – the guidelines set out principles -based guidance  that can apply across this diverse ecosystem to support the development of trustworthy AI. The  Commission  defines three necessary  components for trustworthy AI, which should all be met  throughout the system ’s entire life cycle:   1. It should be lawful, complying with all applicable laws and regulations;   2. It should be ethical, ensuring adherence to ethical principles and values; and   3. It sh ould be robust, both from a technical and social perspective since, even with good  intentions, AI systems can cause unintentional harm.   Based on those three necessary components, the Commission : identifies and describes the ethical  principles that must be adhered to in order to ensure ethical and robust AI; translates these ethical  principles into seven key requirements that AI systems should implement and meet throughout their  entire life cycle; and sets out a non -exhaustive trustworthy AI assessment list to operationalise the  requirements.   Figure 57: Framework for Trustworthy AI235    As a major step in the aim to turn Europe into the global hub for trustworthy AI, in April 2021, the  European Commission laid out proposals for new rules and actions, focusing on a human- centric  approach to AI.236 The efforts include the first -ever legal framework on AI and a new c oordinated plan                                                              234 Ethics guidelines for Trus tworthy AI , High -Level Expert Group on AI (European Commission), 2019.   235 Ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI , High -Level Expert Group on AI (European Commission), 2019.   236 On 21 April 2021, the European Commission launched a proposal on new rules and actio ns for excellence and trust in  Artificial Intelligence, including Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial  Intelligence Act); Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence 2021 Review; and Proposal for a R egulation of the European  Parliament and of the Council on machinery product  (link)

To  complement this, ne w rules on machinery will adapt safety rules to increase trust in the new, versatile  generation of product s.  Several other countries and organi sations besides the  European Union have published principles and  guidelines on AI ethics, including Australia, Singapore, Japan and the OECD. Overall, they share a  degree of commonality and promote similar values , which can be summari sed in ten general guiding  principles (see  Table 10 ). Together with the Ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI  and potential  guidelines of EU Member States, these principles could provide a starting point for investment  guidelines to steer  decision -making on  public and private investment s in AI.     Table 10: Ten general guiding principles for ethical AI       While the ethical concerns around AI are constantly growing in importance in the public debate s,  the same amount of attention has not yet been paid to such concerns for blockchain technologies.237  Initial research suggests however that several potential ethical issues of blockchain  will need to be  addressed , such as :238  • Protection of data stored by blockchain  technology;   • Trade -off between benefits of blockchain  and its energy consumption;   • Transparency and regulation around smart contracts ;  • Anti-trust matters , such as  anti-competitive behavio ur arising from information sharing or the  emerg ence  of a monopoly controlling blockchain  in a specific domain; and   • Potential frauds and other predicate offen ces deriving from blockchain  anonymity.                                                               237 Why it’s time to start talking about blockchain ethics .

88 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Rega rding  data protection, one concern is the potential tension between blockchain  and the GDPR.   Two key factors will need to be addressed. First, the GDPR is based on the underlying assumption that  in relation to each personal data point there is at least one natural or legal person – the data controller  – against whom data subjects can enforce their rights under EU data protection law. Blockchain , by its  very nature , seeks decentrali sation and , hence , does not include  a data controller. Second, the GDPR  assumes that data can be modified or erased where necessary to comply with legal requirement s,  whereas  blockchain  is designed to ensure data integrity , and thus obstruct s the modification or  deletion of recorded data.239  Risks to individuals along the data value chain     The study proposes  a high -level framework that could be used to identify risks to individuals from new ways  of collecting, using and selling  data in the context of AI applications. This framework comprises three key  components along the value chain typical of AI models:   • Collection of data: The first phase entails  collecti ng vast amounts of data needed to train the AI models. In  this phase, risks or harms to citizens can derive from specific products/interfaces used to collect data (e.g.  smart devices, online platforms), as well as when and where data from the public are  collected ( such as   public photos for facial recog nition, smart city sensors);   • Use of data to improve products/services: D ata are typically used to train AI models and improve the  products /services offered by a company. This is done via algorithms that generate insights from data for  specific individuals ( for example,  targeted pricing or products) or insights about the behaviour of groups of  individuals (e.g. consumer analytics); and   • Use of data -driven insights: These insights  are typically used to generate value for  the company, either via  better access t o individuals (e.g. targeted advertising) or by influencing individual  behaviours (e.g. nudges).   The framework is represented in Figure  58.  Figure 58: Risks of AI to individuals along the data value chain240                                                                  239 Blockchain and the General Data Protection Regulation, Panel for the Future of Science and Technology, European  Parliamentary Research Service, 2019.  240 Oliver Wyman Forum analysis.   
   Ethical and societal implications of AI and blockchain  89 Impact of AI on the Sustainable Development Goals     The 17 SDGs are at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all UN  members   in 2015.241 They aim to provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now  and in the future , through  commitment to eliminate  poverty, find sustainable and inclusive development  solutions, ensure everyone’s human rights, and generally make sure no one is left behind by 2030.  For each  of the goals, associated targets (169 in total) are  defined to a llow tracking of progress towards achievement.  The European Union is committed to implement ing the SDGs in all its  policies and is pushing for each and  every Member State to  do the same.242,  243  Figure 59: The 17 Sustainable Development Goals       AI will transform the European society and economy  at large , and is therefore expected to have a significant  impact on the progress towards achieving the SDGs.  According to a  recently published study,244 AI can  potentially support the accomplishment of 134 targets  (79%) but potentially inhibit  achieving 59 targets  (35%).  More  specifically , 93% of the Environment -related targets, 82% of the Society -related targets  and 70% of the  Economy -related targets can be  positively influenced  by AI.  However, AI also brings the risk of increas ing  inequality, for instance,  as educational and computing resources are unevenly distributed across the world.   However  – if done right –  AI has the potential to unlock benefits that could go far beyond the SDGs within  this century. However, the same study stresses the need for dialogue  among all stakeholders and for  regulatory oversight of this technology to enable sustainable development and avoid potential gaps in  transparency, safety and ethical standards.                                                                      241 Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015.

   Recommendations  91 7. Recommendations   The study identified three major areas needing improvement in Europe’s AI and blockchain   landscape.  The bottlenecks in financing AI and blockchain  require a strategic and comprehensive  public –private response. The challenges identified span the development of AI and blockchain   technologies, their deployment in the market, and the wider EU innovation ecosystem. Accordingly,  the stud y makes several recommendations for address ing the three key objectives:   4. Development:  Boost financing for AI and blockchain  development and scale -up  5. Deployment: Support take -up of AI and blockchain  technologies in the market   6. EU innovation ecosystem: Develo p a European integrated innovation ecosystem     The recommendations for each of these objectives are outlined in Figure 60 and discussed in more  detail in the rest  of this section .  Figure 60: Mapping of recommendations to key identified objectives        
92 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  7.1. Boost financing for AI and blockchain  development  and scale -up    The study has identified four key initiatives for this first objective.   Recommendation A: Intensify fundraising for AI/ blockchain  investment scheme with institutional  investors, corporates, family offices  and national promotional banks ; and carve out funds for  growth -stage venture capital funds   The EIF could, within its capacity, leverage its visibility in the European venture capit al space and its  track record to focus fundraising for the dedicated AI/ blockchain investment scheme among private  institutional investors, large corporates and family offices . This could be done via an investment  structure aim ed at optimis ing the trade- off for participating parties with a lower risk –return profile,  such as through a dedicated fund -of-funds  and/or downside guarantee mechanisms to attract  institutional investors (e.g. with asymmetric returns, to the extent that appropriate products would be  made available to  the EIF). The EIF could also maximise fundraising with Member States (via national  promotional banks ) to further increase the scheme’s capacity , and aim for optimal complementarity  with other national programmes.   The EIF could then carve out funds dedicated to growth- stage venture capital funds  investing in AI  scale -ups. This could be done  as a pilot similar to the recently launched European Scale -up Action  for Risk Capital  Programme, and could focus purely on AI technologies ( blockchain is still at early  stages). In the longer term, funds could be carved out within the dedicated AI/ blockch ain investment  scheme (current ly focused on startup phase only, up to Series A). This would contribute to improving  within -EU opportunities for growth -stage SMEs that might alternatively get financing outside the  European Union , hence also improv ing exit o pportunities for EU venture capital funds  that invested in  earlier stages .  Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  • Increase mobilisation of private funds (especially from larger institutional  investors)   • Provide dedicated financing to growth -stage AI SMEs   Bottleneck(s) addressed  Limited availability of venture capital  and private investments   Main stakeholder(s)  EIF  Assessment  Expected impact on AI/ blockchain  access to finance  High   Expected implementation cost/complexity  Medium       
   Recommendations  93   Case study: EIF Asset  Management Umbrella Fund  (AMUF)     The EIF initiated the AMUF in 2017, with the aim of increas ing private investments in European venture capital . The  AMUF is a fund- of-funds  leveraging the EIF’s visibility in the European venture capital  space and its track record as a  fundraiser among institutional investors and family offices . The AMUF is an investment vehicle managed by a general  partner, AMUF GP, and an a lternative investment fund manager, Alter Domus. As of April 2019 the AMUF has con sisted  of three divisions, each with a specific focus.   Figure 61: Structure of the AMUF         Investors are required to commit a minimum of €80 million  of funding to participate. The AMUF invests on behalf of its  participants, using the EIF’s visibility in funds with a promising track record. To ensure transparency over its investment  activities, the AMUF establishes a close relationship with investors, fostered by its client relationship team and regional  senior sales teams. Investors al so receive access to  the EIF’s Knowledge Hub, which provides insight s into and best  practices in the private equity market, and EIF information portals such as the Virtual Data Room and the Investment  Café, which share private equity  market insights and ac t as communication platform s for investors. Finally , AMUF  investors are invited to the annual Institutional Investor Global Forum covering the AMUF’s investment activities and  progress.     By 31  January 2019, the European venture capital , Life Sciences and G rowth Capital divisions  had jointly invested €157  million  in 14 funds, including IK Small Cap II, Highland Europe III and Fountain Healthcare Partners III.       Recommendation B: Monitor the deployment  of and consider expanding the AI co -investment  facility to provide additional firepower to AI/ blockchain fund managers backed by the EIF that  invested in successful SMEs   The EIB could leverage the InvestEU programme to monitor and eventually expand the recent AI co investment facility to successful venture capital funds  backed by the EIF , while also extending its  
94 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  scope  to include blockchain investments . This facility amounts to €150 million  and deploy ment began  in January 2021. The proposed expansion would co mplement the AI/ blockchain  investment scheme in  sustaining the growth of successful startups and scale -ups through co -investments between the EIB  Group and top -ranked venture capital funds and investment partners. The o perational burden would  be limited by  leverag ing due diligence performed by the EIF. The facility would invest pari passu with  other investors , and would also be able to deploy smaller tickets. If proven successful, scaling up the  initiative could be highly impactful.   Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  • Increase mobilisation of private funds (especially for follow -up investments)   • Stimulate strategic public –private co -investments   Bottleneck(s) addressed  Limited availability of venture capital  and private investments   Main stakeholder(s)  EIF  Assessment  Expected impact on AI/ blockchain  access to finance  High   Expected implementation cost/complexity  Medium     Recommendation C: Expand the overall capacity of the EIB v enture debt programme to support  successful and innovative SMEs recovering from  the COVID -19 crisis ; potentially also develop a  customised thematic (pilot) facility for AI and blockchain (or a wider deep- tech facility)   The EIB could leverage the InvestEU programme to expand the capacity of its venture debt  programme and strategically  focus on innovative firms struggling to raise their next round of  financing in the aftermath of COVID -19. Venture debt  financing would allow these innovation -driven  SMEs to extend the cash runway until more favourable market conditions return for a new  independent round of financing, and prevent them from  suffering depressed valuations because of the  pandemic. The EIB could also consider expanding programme eligibility to earlier financing stages ( for  instance  after Series A, instead of B/C) and to smaller  tickets (minimum ticket size is €7.5 million  under  the European Growth Finance Facility  but €3 million  for companies in moderate innovator countries   and €5 million  in other countries  under the Pan -European Guarantee Fund , EGF). A similar setup could  also be envisaged under InvestEU.   Further, the EIB –  in close collaboration with the European Commission – could explore develop ing  a thematic (pilot) facility dedicated to AI/ blockchain companies, or a facility with a broader scope  covering deep tech. The setu p could be similar to those of  successful concept s such as the  Energy  Demo Project, Future Mobility Facility and InnovFin Infectious Diseases F acility. Compared to the EIB’s  generic venture debt product, such a dedicated facility could benefit from higher risk -sharing capacity  and allow for increased risk -taking, in line with the profile of AI and blockchain  companies.   Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  • Support innovative firms that,  following COVID -19, are struggling to raise  their next round of financing   • Conduct a pilot on AI and blockchain  SMEs   Bottleneck(s) addressed  Limited availability of venture capital  and private investments   Main stakeholder(s)  EIF  Assessment  Expected impact on AI/ blockchain  access to finance  Medium   Expected implementation cost/complexity  Medium       
   Recommendations  95 Recommendation D: Launch a dedicated AI/ blockchain  call for projects as part of the EIC, similar to  the recent E uropean Innovation Council (E IC) call dedicated to COVID -19, and consider transforming  part of the new and existing grant budget of the EIC into contingent grants and/or forgivable loans   Up to € 2.5 million  in grants and €15 million  in equity are provided by the EIC to innovative startups  in Horizon 2020 countries. The E IC could launch a specific AI/ blockchain  call (similarly to its recent call  dedicated to  COVID -19) to give a dedicated opportunity for researchers and young startups active in  this field to turn their projects into successful business solutions. This call should award grants/equity  funding and European Commission  Seals of Excellence.   With applications to the EIC hav ing more than doubled since the pandemic  began , the European  Commission  could consider transforming part of the new and existing EIC grant budget into  forgivable loans or contingent grants. These could be repaid as a loan if the company is successful and  not repaid otherwise , thus increasing the capacity of the EIC scheme as repaid grants are made  available for new grants. The EIC could “outsource” the recovery function (to the EIB or other players ).  Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  • Stimulate application of successful research projects into business solutions   • Broaden acce ss to finance of large pool of innovative projects (through Seals  of Excellence)   Bottleneck(s) addressed  • Strong research base but limited R&D spending   • Fragmented innovation ecosystem   Main stakeholder(s)  EIB, potentially  with  other players  involved in loan recovery process   Assessment  Expected impact on AI/ blockchain  access to finance  Medium   Expected implementation cost/complexity  Medium     Case study: Innovate UK: Investment Accelerator Programme    Innovate UK is part of UK Research and Innovation, a public body funded by the UK government. It aims to de risk and stimulate investments in innovative UK startups active in emerging and e nabling technologies, health  and life sciences, infrastructure systems, or manufacturing and m aterials.     Innovate UK’s Investment Accelerator Programme (IAP) organises funding competitions to connect startups with  private investors. It subsequently matches the equity funding that startups receive from private investors wi th  grant funding. The IAP selects investors either through competition s or from its network of strategic partners  (e.g. Sky Ocean Ventures).     The competitions  are organised in two rounds  through which investors and startups  are selected and matched.  During the Investor Partner Competition, Innovate UK’s Investment Advisory Board selects investors meeting its  requirements, ensuring adequate geographic and sectoral coverage.245 During the second contest , the  Investment Accelerat or Competition, Innovate UK publishes the list of participating investors and invites startups  to apply for  the IAP, with the option of applying to a specific investor.246    Since 2017 Innovate UK has organised five IAPs. During the pilot, seven  private investors active in Health and Life  Sciences and Infrastructure Systems were selected ; together with Innovate UK , they  provided £8.5 million   (€9.8 million ) in funding to startups (£2.5 million  in private equity and £6 million  in grant funding). In  the second  IAP, £6 million  in grant funding and a similar amount of private equity  was raised , focusing on Infrastructure                                                              245 The Investor Partner Competition is skipped where the IAP is initiated in collaboration with a strategic partner.   246 Applicants should fit the EU definition of an SME: turnover does not exceed €50 m illion or balance sheet total is  below  €43 million; staff headcount is below 250.

The Ocean Plastics Accelerator Competition  saw £2 million  in grant funding and private equity  provided  to startups fighting waste.   Figure  62: Structure of the Investment Accelerator Programme of Innovate UK       7.2. Support take -up of AI and blockchain  technologies in the market   The study has identified three key initiatives for this second objective.   Recommendation E: Provide advisory services to EU Member States in deployment of AI/ blockchain   investment program mes to enhance coordination between the European Union and Member States ,  and support the deployment of AI/ blockchain technologies by traditional companies (espe cially   SMEs) that want to transform their business models in the aftermath of COVID -19. There are  potential links to the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and the Digital Europe Programme (D EP)  The European Commission and Member States have launched s everal huge  support schemes to  promote econom ic recover y from the COVID -19 crisis. Accordingly, key recommendations  include  the  following :  1. The Commission  could consider drawing on some component s of the EU-level schemes (e.g.  InvestEU) to encourage investments in AI/ blockchain  technologies that could accelerate the  recovery of hardest -hit sectors. F or example , conditional grants/forgivable loans could be attached  to the deployment of AI/ blockchain  technology -based solutions and assigned via specific  competitions; in particular, anchoring business models more robustly in AI/ blockchain  could  materially benefit sectors such as automotive, manufacturing, hospitality, and education. The  Commission  would also need to ensure coordination between  the European Union  and M ember  States  in deploying EU and local AI/ blockchain  investment program mes.  2. Most national promotional banks  have launched support schemes in the aftermath of COVID -19.  The EIB Group could  deploy coordinated co -funding models with t hese banks  to ensure that  AI/blockchain  technology and startups become more central in local financing response s to  recover from the crisis generated by COVID -19 (e.g. via the EGF ).  3. Under  the RRF, Member States will prepare recovery and resilience plans fo r a coherent package  of reforms and public investment projects. Each plan must devote at least 20% of expenditure to  foster ing the digital transition. To step up financing from other sources, the EIB could close ly  
   Recommendations  97 collaborat e with the European Commission  to support Member States in the design and  implementation of these plans, exploring and encouraging top -up possibilities by members  for  particular thematic areas : e.g. focus on development and deployment of AI and blockchain   technologies.   4. AI is one of the  five high -level components of the DEP. Given the complex ity of AI  technologies,  deep specialist knowledge could be required to assess their potential  and mitigate significant  information asymmetries that could limit deep -tech developers’ access  to finance . To bridge the  information gap and improve the positioning of digital companies with respect to investors, one  key recommendation is implementing dedicated advisory support, perhaps through the EIB’s  Innovation Finance Advisory team. Envisaged activities could help create the necessary financial  preconditions ( such as  through market intelligence and development of the  investor ecosystem,  financial product s and  blending structures) and pilot initiatives ( e.g. flagship/demonstration  projects) that could be further scaled  up under InvestEU (complementary to other financial sources  such as the RRF).   Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  • Leverage COVID -19 support schemes to transform business models in  strategic sectors   • Facilitate deployment of AI and blockchai n technologies across  the economy   Bottleneck(s) addressed  • Limited availability of venture capital  and private investments   • Fragmented innovation ecosystem   Main stakeholder(s)  European Commission , selected national promotional banks   Assessment  Expected impact on AI/blockchain  access to finance  High   Expected implementation cost/complexity  High     Case study: Israel Innovation Authority  (IIA)  – Conditional grants     The objectives and functions of the IIA include  develop ing Israel’s innovation infrastructure, creat ing jobs and  building  technological and scientific human resources, promot ing innovation by distributing grants and  providing financial support , and connect ing the economy with the global innovation industry.     Accordingly , the IIA’s ac tivities include the provision of financial support to companies across different stages  of the enterprise life cycle and the administering of technological incubator programmes to support early stage companies. T he IIA is also in charge of several R&D col laboration initiatives between the academic and  commercial sectors.     These objectives and activities are enabled through targeted divisions focused on a particular activity or stage  in the company life cycle. Currently, these include a Startup Division focused on pre -sale companies, a Growth  Division focused on early -stage companies, a Technology Infrastructure Division focused on collaboration  between industry and academia, an Advance Manufacturing Division focused on research implementation, an  International Collaboration Division focused on cooperation with other countries , and a Societal Challenges  Division focused on improving the effectiveness and quality of public sector services.     Financial support and grants   While the IIA offers traditi onal R&D grants, its primary financing tool for SMEs is conditional grants, i.e.  grants/loans whose repayment is contingent on the success of the project or company.  Conditional grants are  a hybrid between grants and loans. If the project fails and does no t produce revenues, the principal is lost  (effectively treated as  a grant ). Conversely , if the project succeeds and generates sufficient revenues, sales  royalties are collected by the IIA until the principal is repaid with a small amount of interest ( effec tively treated  as a loan ). Conditional grants thus limit the downside risk faced by new technology ventures while allowing 
98 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  the public sector to benefit from the potential upside of successful projects , therefore increas ing its financing  capacity. Israel be gan invest ing heavily in R&D as early as the 1960s , when the main tools were standard grants  given to companies for R&D purposes. As some successful companies were able to reimburse grant payments   to the IIA, conditional grants were born in the mid- 1980s, allowing for more financing of innovative SMEs.     Currently, for a company to qualify for a particular conditional grant, it must first meet the eligibility criteria.  Different funds are available to support innovative companies across the full life cycle a nd a variety of  industries. The vari ous funds available  are detailed  below .    If a company meets the initial requirements, a comprehensive professional assessment is then conducted by  an engineer qualified and experienced in the relevant field and by an accountant. The engineer provides  insight s on  the technological risk and feasibility of the proposal , while the accountant analyses the financial  statements. The accountant does not currently look into different financing options but will be  expected to  do so when a richer arsenal of financial instruments becomes  available to the IIA . If the R&D proposal and  technology are deemed promising and the  level of technolog ical risk is appropriate , a conditional grant is given  to cov er a portion of the expenditure  – the exact amount depends on the fund and the company.     Example of programmes   The Startup Division focuse s on entrepreneurs with innovative ideas and early- stage startup companies , while   the Technology Innovation Labs foster collaboration between established companies and startups to promote  knowledge transfer. F inancing can be obtained in the form of grants for fundamental research.  For example,  the Tnufa Incentive Program provides condi tional grants of up to ~€50 000 for a period of up to two years ,  aimed at supporting initial business development and building an initial prototype .    The Growth D ivision provides funding for more mature companies in the sales or pre -sale growth stages. For   instance, the R&D Fund provides a conditional grant of 20 –50% of a firm’s approved R&D expenditure .    Larger companies are also incentivised to innovate. For instance, generic R&D arrangements can be put in  place by the Growth D ivision for companies with r evenues >$100 million . Full grants of up to 50% of approved  R&D expenditure are given to such companies for projects executed in cooperation with other Israeli  companies.  In addition, certain sectors are promoted by providing additional grants. For instanc e, the R&D for  Space Technology F und provides grants of up to 85% of approved R&D expenditure for a period of 36 months  to companies whose product and research focus  on space technology.     Development of new products   The IIA will lend directly to companies using traditional loans by depositing money at financial institutions and  ensuring that loans  are provided to qualif ying entities. This will provide more flexibility in  structur ing loans  and select ing the appropriate  level of risk for  the IIA to take. It will also allow the IIA to recover greater  proportions of deployed funds , and thus potentially finance a greater number of innovative companies.       Recommendation F: Develop a risk -based framework to assess and certify AI/ blockchain  technologies that meet EU -wide “trustworthiness ,” ethical and regulatory requirements; this would  help build trust with investors  in and deployers of these technologies   The European Commission could develop a risk -based framework to determine whether  AI/blockchain- based startups meet “trustworthiness ,” ethical and regulatory requirements (e.g. on  data protection and transparency for AI; on energy consumption for blockchain) . The  level of risk  could be driven by the sector and intended use of the technology . Assessment of specific projects  could be coordinated by EU digital innovation hubs ( DIHs ), with projects  receiving a “ green stamp” to  denote  EU-wide recognition that their AI/ blockchain  systems have been developed according to  European standards and regulations. Potentially, certification could also be used to grant these 
   Recommendations  99 projects access to specific EU- wide initiatives, such as pools of data established under the EU Data  Strategy. The EIF could also use  the tra demark , among other tools, to guide its investments and give  confidence to private investors about a specific technology/company. DIHs could also coordinate  regulatory sandboxes to drive fine -tuning of existing (and potentially new)  EU regulations to  accommodate specific aspects  of AI/ blockchain  (for instance  based on the EU “innovation principle”),  recognising that AI’s true value lies in sustainab ility and human -centric ity to ensure fairness and  unbiasedness  in which EU citizens  can trust .  Regarding trustworthy and ethical AI, focus on “gender smart ” AI is particularly recommended to  ensure gender equality (linked to SDG 5: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and  girls ”). Europe is at the global forefront of considering AI’s ethical implications ,247 aiming to ensure  transparency , diversity, non -discrimination and fairness , and societal and environmental well- being.  These aspects are  key for successful development and deployment of AI across the whole European  Union.  Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  • Develop EU- wide recognition in the marketplace that AI/blockchain  systems  have been developed according to European standards and regulations, for  access -to-finance  and other initiatives (e.g. EU -wide data lakes)   • Build up trust with investors and deployers of AI/ blockchain  technologies   • Drive fine -tuning of existing (and potentially new) EU regulations   Bottleneck(s) addressed  • Evolving regulatory landscape   • Limited availability of data   Main stakeholder(s)  EU DIHs; E IF  Assessment  Expected impact on AI/ blockchain  access to finance  Medium   Expected implementation cost/complexity  High     Case study: GAIA -X – a federated data infrastructure for Europe     GAIA -X brings together representatives from politics, business and science across Europe with the aim of  develop ing common requirements for a European data infrastructure –  a secure, federated system that meets  the highest standards of digital sovereignty while promoting innovation. This project is the cradle of an open,  transparent digital ecosystem, where data and se rvices can be made available, collated and shared in an  environment of trust.  Over 300 organi sations are already involved in the project.     GAIA -X combine s centralised and decentralised infrastructures in a homogeneous, user -friendly system. The  resulting f ederated form of data infrastructure strengthens the ability to access and share data securely and  confidently . GAIA -X will strengthen the underlying level of trust, lower  the barriers to participation , reduce the  amount of work involved in bilateral coord ination between individual users , and instantiate the guarantee of  data sovereignty.     Technical platform   Federat ion services provide value if based on common standards ensur ing transparency and interoperability.  GAIA -X addresses this requirement by aligning network and interconnection providers, c loud solution providers,  high performance computing , and sector -specific clouds and edge systems.  GAIA -X also identifies the minimum  technical requirements and services necessary to operate the federated GAIA -X Ecosystem.                                                                 247 Ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI, European Commission, 2019.

The GAIA -X project is divided into two workstreams and a cross -functional unit:   • User Ecosystems and R equirements   Focus on broad and sustained mobilisation of the user and demand perspective, definition of domainspecific and cross -domain requirements, as well as existing approaches on which GAIA -X should build.   • Technical Implementation   Focus on building the legally compliant and sovereign European data infrastructure. This  workstream is  currently developing a technical concept to defin e the require d reference architecture and to describe the  basic technical functionalities of the data infrastructure.   • Cross -functional unit : “Joint Requirements ”  The expert groups of th is unit deal with topics involving  strong interdependency between the workstreams.  This includes areas such as general technical requirements and regulatory aspects.      
   Recommendations  101 Figure  63: Structure of the GAIA -X project         Recommendation G: Fine -tune EU and Member State public procurement process es to  accommodate participation of small, young and innovative AI/ blockchain companies to help turn   the European Union’s strong research outputs into successful businesses   In line with o pen innovation principles, the European Commission could further facilit ate and  encourage participation of small, young and innovative European AI/ blockchain companies in  procurement processes at the EU and Member State level. This would give opportunit ies for  researchers and young startups to develop AI and blockchain  solutio ns for direct deploy ment  by the  public sector  – helping realise the potential of  the European Union ’s strong research outputs by giving  researchers a lead “client” for their products in the early stage s. It would also help the deployment of  these solutions  by the public sector. The Commission  could also link public procurement to EU research  priorities in AI/ blockchain , e.g. digitalisation of public administration, defence  and climate policy. This  could involve, for example , lowering certain thresholds, adjust ing minimum required financial  conditions or introduc ing more flexible timelines.   Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  • Give innovative researchers a lead “client” for their products from early stage   • Support technologica l deployment in the public sector   Bottleneck(s) addressed  • Strong research base, but limited R&D spending   • Limited appetite for blockchain  investments   Main stakeholder(s)  European Commission , key stakeholders involved in public procurement   process es  Assessment  Expected impact on AI/ blockchain  access to finance  Medium   Expected implementation cost/complexity  High        
102 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  7.3. Develop a European, integrated innovation ecosystem   The study has identified three key initiatives for this third  objective.   Recommendation H: Strengthen DIHs to connect stakeholders of the AI/blockchain ecosystem across   the European Union and foster clusters of speciali sation, as per recommendations in the EIB report  titled Financing the digitalisation of small and medium -sized enterprises: The enabling role of digital  innovation hubs   EU DIHs are key to creat ing a network of smart one -stop advisory hubs to connect AI and blockchain   SMEs across  the European Union with one another, inve stors, large corporates, research centres,  businesses wishing to deploy these technologies, and all other stakeholders of the innovation  landscape. The hubs should also direct SMEs to players  providing advisory services and in particular  advice on available funding programmes (for firms wishing to develop or already deploying  AI/blockchain  technologies). In each country, DIHs could also foster the creation of AI/ blockchain   specialisation structures in specific EU sector/priority areas (e.g. healthcare, tran sport, agriculture,  climate, and energy).   Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  • Support deployment of AI/ blockchain  technologies   • Foster the creation of AI/ blockchain  speciali sation clusters in specific EU  sector s/priority areas   Bottleneck(s) addressed  • Fragmented innovation ecosystem   • Limited matching between SMEs and investors   Main stakeholder(s)  EU DIHs   Assessment  Expected impact on AI/ blockchain  access to finance  Medium -High   Expected implementation cost/complexity  Medium     Case study: KfW’s Gr ünderplat tform     KfW ’s Gründerplattform is a joint online offer of the Federal Ministry of Economics and KfW. On the platform  innovators can, for example, develop initial ideas, write a business plan, learn from successful founders or find  funding opportunities, including matchmaking with potential investors. The platform is publicly funded and free  to use. A r ecent KfW survey ( Spring 2020, 3 900 participants) show ed that four out of five  platform users have  either already implemented their idea or reached  the planning phase.     How it works   The names and offers of key players in startup support (e.g. chambers of commerce, state development  institutes, guarantee banks and credit institutions ) are included on the platform. It is possible for users to receive  direct advice or feedback on a proposed business model or business plan,  or to submit a financing request to a  credit institution. The platform also facilitates network and community build ing by inviting participants to  exchange ideas .    The platform guides users through a standardi sed startup process. All digital services required for the process  can be found directly on the platform. The process is focused on  learning from successful found ers ( for example,   an extensive video library showcases entrepreneurs describing how they got started) and networking with  potential investors.    
   Recommendations  103 Figure  64: Landing page of K fW's Gründerplat tform (one -stop shop)       In the planning section, an interactive business plan tool supports development of a business plan with a  conclusive financial section , completely free of charge. The f ounder platform guides users through each step of  the calculations. It also provides an overview of key figures and how a bank will assess  them.     The financing section offers innovators important information around financing and available possibilities to  pursue further. The startup platform shows which financing options are available and which best suit the current  business idea. Innovators can receive suggestions on where to find the right contact person in the ir local area.  Multiple tips are available on how to prepare for the funding interview and how to increase the chances of  receiving funding. It is  also possible to share draft documents with banks or other partners for review – this  allows  potential lenders to get an idea of the concept before the first conversation and  to work on developing  the final idea.       
104 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  Recommendation I: As part of the EIF AI /blockchain investment scheme, fuel competition and  specialisation in the venture capital  market by supporting the creation of new specialised venture  capital funds  (first -time funds)   The EIF, with relevant resources, could focus the AI/ blockchain investment scheme on helping  to  creat e new venture capital  firms speciali sed in AI/ blockchain (e.g. possessing a mix of business and  engineering teams) and support/sponsor them until they achieve  a critical mass and track record  allow ing them to raise fun ds in the market independently. This could fuel competition and expertise  in the EU venture capital market by creating a multitude of speciali sed (and eventually large) funds  that could give technical and financial support to European AI and blockchain  SME s.  Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  Foster creation of new venture capital  firms speciali sed in AI/ blockchain  in the  European Union and Horizon 2020 associated countries   Bottleneck(s) addressed  Limited specialisation of EU venture capital  funds in AI and blockchain   Main stakeholder(s)  EIF  Assessment  Expected impact on AI/ blockchain  access to finance  High   Expected implementation cost/complexity  Medium -High     Case study: Small Business Investment Company     The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) programme was launched in the United States in  1958 to  facilitate the flow of long -term capital, such as equity, to small businesses. This initiative is particularly targeted  at younger, innovative companies that face difficulties obtaining funding from traditional lenders.     The Small Business Administration ( SBA) licenses qualified investment firms as SBICs, which  then use their own  capital in addition to funds borrowed with an SBA guarantee to make equity and debt investments. The 301  licensee firms (SBICs) obtain funds from debentures that are issued by the government and then resold on the  market at a low cost, g iven the SBA guarantee. This gives  these firms access to cheap funding that they can then  deploy without having to share the upside. Typically, an  SBIC ’s funding is matched at a ratio of 1 -to-1 or 2- to-1  using SBA funding.   Figure  65: Example of t he SBIC investment process       The SBIC programme focuses on increasing the attractiveness of  funding small venture capital  firms. The setup  increas es the financing capacity by boosting  total funding through debentures  (bonds  that are secured by  company assets ). This results in a “leveraged” structure that magnifies returns (and losses in the downside). The   programme has a size of  $150 million  and SBICs need to invest in small businesses with annual net income below  $6.5 million  in the  last two years prior to investment .    As a result, the returns are asymmetric: the government has lower downside risk as it has seniority over other  creditors, but the private sector SBICs obtain all of the upside. This is mutually beneficial as the SBICs effectively  leverage their returns while the government ’s cost is reduced by higher seniority. The additional downside risk  for SBICs, given the debenture ’s higher priority  for repayment, does not deter investors from using the Private investors Pensions, Foundations, Banks  High -Net Worth Individuals, etc. US Small Business  Administration (SBA)Small Business  Investment Company  (SBIC)Small Business Small Business Small Business Small Business$1 $2$3
   Recommendations  105 programme as there is a self -selection process : only SBICs with expected high returns are willing to draw down  the funds.     The SBIC programme is often credited as instrumental in developing the venture capital  industry in the United  States . Currently, there are 301 licensee firms man aging over $28 billion  in asset s. In 201 6, the programme  provided $6  billion  in financing to 1 200 small businesses, thereby help ing to sustain 122  000 jobs. A multitude  of very large technology firms, such as Apple, Intel and Tesla, have received funding from SBICs during their  earlier growth stages. More interestingly, the programme has zero cost to the taxpayer as the debentures have  high seniority and funds are typically recovered.       Recommendation J: Scale  up the Investment Support Program me within the AI/ blockchain   investment scheme to establish a networking platform connecting AI/ blockchain companies with  relevant investors across the  European Union, with particular focus on addressing the investment  imbalance in Central, Eastern and South- Eastern Europe (CESEE)   The European Commission could establish a networking platform ( for instance,  by scaling up the  Investment Support Program of the AI/ blockchain investment scheme) to facilitate matchmaking  between AI and blockchain SMEs, investors and available EIB Group funding programmes. The  platform could help match SMEs with appropriate investors based on expertise, financing stage,  location  and industry. The platform could also foster information exchange between early -stage and  growth- stage inve stors to share best practices for scaling up in the EU market, offering advice and  knowledge on cross -border tax and legal affairs. As part of a larger digitalisation effort, the platform  could focus particularly on addressing investment needs in CESEE via cooperation and synergy creation  with other EU programmes such as the DISC.   Recommendation overview   Objective(s)  • Facilitate matching between AI/blockchain  SMEs, venture capital funds  and  available EIF funding programmes, especially in CESEE   • Facilitate  information exchange ( for example,  best practices for scaling up  across  the European Union)   Bottleneck(s) addressed  • Limited matching between SMEs and investors   • Fragmented innovation ecosystem   Main stakeholder(s)  European Commission  (with EIF and EIB support)   Assessment  Expected impact on AI/ blockchain  access to finance  Medium -High   Expected implementation cost/complexity  Medium -High       Case study: Small Digital Innovation and Scale -up Initiative (DISC)     To address the digital economy investment gap in  Central, Eastern and South- Eastern Europe (CESEE), the  European Commission , EIB Group , European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and World Bank Group  launch ed the DISC at the Digital Assembly in Bucharest in 2019.  The DI SC is setting up the first r egional  investment facility that specifically targets digital innovations and the scale -up of digital startups in CESEE.     The initiative’s targeted financing tools are tailored to the early stage and the scale -up phase of digital startups,  which require ri skier financing and are underserved by the traditional finance sector. The DISC also offers a  technical assistance programme with the goal of strengthen ing the institutional capacity of public agencies to  design, develop and implement digital innovation pr ogrammes. Finally, the DISC will boost investment in the

According to an EIF survey :  – 76% of respondents already have AI companies in their portfolio,  whereas only 23% have blockchain  companies   – 87% of respondents consider it likely or highly likely they will have AI  companies in their portfolio, compared to 51% for blockchain   companies   – blockchain  is at an earlier stage and still focused on financial services  in investors’ mind s  • Availability of venture capital  financing is higher in Western Europe but  improving in other EU areas   – Germany and France together capture 70% of all AI/ blockchain   investments in 2010 –2019 • “2019 was possibly the best time ever for  European venture capital , but the  coronavirus pandem ic has stopped the  trend”   • “The appetite for  AI is not lagging much  vs. US or China in terms of strategies and  intentions, but in terms of realisation”   • “Western Europe an funds are slowly  moving to invest also in Eastern Europe”   • “There are plenty of opportunities venture capital  funds cannot take because of the  lack of funds”   • “It is not clear how core technology developers are getting funded in the EU”  
118 Artificial intelligence, blockchain and the future of Europe  – US venture capital funds  are increasingly entering the EU market   • Investors have higher preference for s ector -specific SMEs (lower risk)   Impact of  COVID -19 • Venture capital funds  are not expected to make further inve stments until  they have more clarity on the crisis, but will eventually resume  because  their appetite for innovative technologies is strong   • Venture capital funds  (especially those relying on public financing) will  struggle to  raise funds in the market   • Valuations in the European Union are likely to be substantially reduced  • SMEs developing core AI/ blockchain  applications  and those in  healthcare, FS and data privacy  will likely be positively affected  • “Right now, if you have enough funds to  invest it is better to make bets on sector agnostic AI/ blockchain developments,  because they are not pushed to sell  product s to companies that deploy them in  a sector that might be suffering a crisis”   • “Pre -crisis valuations were possibly too  high. They have decreased now and it is the right time to invest – but we need to  raise funds quickly”   • “What has changed now is that everyone is aware of the need to share data in a systemic way, while keeping the privacy –  data privacy technologies will flourish”   Bottlenecks  • In th e European Union  there is a low investment in venture capital funds   from big institutional investors (e.g. pension funds, insurance companies) ; consequently , venture capital funds  often cannot  finance  their portfolio companies beyond initial stages and pre fer to sell to  make  a profit   – EU venture capital fundraising mostly based on HNWIs and  government   – Need to find ways to open the market to these investors   • Limited number of private acquisitions and IPOs within the EU27, leading  to sale of SMEs to extra -EU investors after initial stages   – There are no big acquirers in Europe (e.g. Oracle) and M&As are rare   – EU IPO ecosystem is not well developed, especially for  tech  • “Largest investors in US venture capital  funds  are pension funds, endowments,  insurance companies – this is very limited  in the EU and it is a major competitive disadvantage”   • “Chinese and US investors focus on  creating national champions and invest heavily in those; EU investments are very  scattered”   • “US West Coast venture capital funds ’  ambition is to find the “Moonshot ,” East  Coast venture capital funds ’ ambition is to  find future to -be-acquired corporates,

They are struggling to raise money”   • “Origination and seed are relatively well developed in the EU. SMEs do seed and  angel in the EU, then they go to the US and  grow their financial network there”   • “Banks and other big companies should be pushed to experiment more in partnership  with AI and b lockchain developers”   • “We need to enable researchers from  academia to feel comfortable and pursue   commercial application of their research”
