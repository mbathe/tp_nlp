         Norwegian Ministry   of Local Government  and Modernisation     Strateg y                    National Strategy for   Artificial Intelligence                       
    2  Foreword  It is difficult to predict the future, but we know that Norway will be  affected by the age wave, climate change and increasing global isation, and that in the coming years we must work smarter and  more efficiently to remain competitive and maintain the same leve l  of welfare. Digitalisation and new technologies are the key to  achieving this, and artificial intelligence will be a vital component.   Artificial intelligence represents vast opportunities for us as individuals, for business and  industry, and for the pub lic sector. If used in the right way , technology can contribute to  achieving the Sustainable Development Goals – not just in Norway, but globally .   There are many good examples of AI in use in Norway, and in the coming years we will  likely see many more, e specially in business and industry and the public sector . While the  United States and China have come far with consumer -oriented applications, our strength  lies in the fact that our industry, business and public sector are more technologically  advanced and  digitalised than in most other countries. Norway is world -leading in the  process industry, green shipping, aquaculture and petroleum activities. We have one of the  most digitalised public sectors in the world. We must continue to build on these  advantages  in our development and use of artificial intelligence.   Norwegian society is characterised by trust and respect for fundamental values such as  human rights and privacy.  This is something we perhaps take for granted in Norway, but  leading the way in develo ping human -friendly and trustworthy artificial intelligence may  prove a key advantage in today's global competition.   There is no denying the fact that AI also presents some difficult questions. Who is  responsible for the consequences of a decision that is made by AI? What happens when  autonomous systems make decisions which we disagree with and which, in a worst -case  scenario, cause harm? And how do we mak e sure that the technology does not inten tionally or unintentionally perpetuate and reinforce discrimination and prejudice? When  faced with dilemmas like these, it can be useful  to have some fundamental principles to  turn to for guidance: transparency, ex plainability and cautious testing. These principles  must also be applied when we develop and use solutions built on artificial intelligence.   While working on this strategy I have had opportunities to meet people who work on  artificial intelligence in acade mia, business and industry, and the public sector. I have had  meetings with employer and employee organisations who see that artificial intelligence will  impact the labour market in the time ahead. An overview of most of these meetings is  available at www.regjeringen.no/ki -strategi , along with all the written input I received. I  would like to thank everyone who shared their engagement and insights.   I hope this strategy can serve as a framework for bot h public and private entities seeking to  develop and use artificial intelligence. Together we will explore the potential that lies in this  exciting technology !           Nikola i Astrup   Minister of Digital isation

The Government wants Norway to take the lead in  developing and using AI that respects in dividuals' rights and freedoms.   Introduction and summary     Artificial intelligence (AI) represents vast opportunities for us as individuals and for  society at large. AI can lead to new, more effective business models and to effective,  user -centric services in the public sector.   Norway is well positioned for succe eding with artificial intelligence. We have :   a high level of public trust in both the business and public sectors    a population and business sector that are digitally competent    An excellent infrastructure and high -quality registry data that span over  many d ecades    well developed e -governance and public agencies that have come a long  way with digitalisation and that have the capacity and expertise to  experiment with new technologies    tripartite cooperation  between employers, unions and government, which  facilit ates cooperation when restructuring is necessary     Technology will not only enable us to perform tasks in increasingly better ways; it will  also enable us to perform them in completely new ways. But development and use of  AI can also present challenges.   Norwegian society is characterised by trust and respect for fundamental values such  as human rights and privacy. The Government wants Norway to lead the way in 
    6 developing and using AI with respect for individual rights and freedoms. This can  become a key a dvantage in today's global competition.   The Government believes that:    artificial intelligence that is developed and used in Norway should be built  on ethical principles and respect human rights and democracy    research, development and use of artificial in telligence in Norway should  promote responsible and trustworthy AI    development and use of AI in Norway should safeguard the integrity and  privacy of the individual    cyber security should be built into the development, operation and  administration of systems  that use AI    supervisory authorities should oversee that AI systems in their areas of  supervision are operated in accordance with the principles for responsible  and trustworthy use of AI   A good basis for artificial intelligence   The Government will facilitate world -class AI infrastructure in Norway in the form of  digitalisation -friendly regulations, good language resources, fast and robust  communication networks, and sufficient computing power. It will facilitate data sharing  within and across indust ries and sectors.   Data   Data is vital  for the develop ment  and us e of AI. Today vast amounts of information are  generated from many different sources. AI and machine learning can use this data to  give us important insights.   Access to high -quality datasets i s essential  for exploiting the potential of AI. The  Government will facilitate data sharing in both the public and private sectors and  between sectors.   Regulations   The Government will evaluate whether there are regulations that hamper appropriate  and desi red use of artificial intelligence in the public and private sectors. There will be  requirements for transparency and accountability in new systems for public  administration in which AI is used. The Government is positive towards establishing  regulatory sa ndboxes in areas where this is called for. Such initiatives already exist in  connection with autonomous transport. The Government will also establish an  advisory body and a regulatory sandbox for AI  in the area of data protection.   Language   Language technol ogies such as speech recognition and language comprehension  represent an important component of AI. To enable Norwegian citizens to participate  in increasingly advanced services in their own language, we need  good language  resources in both Norwegian langu age forms and in Sami. The Government will  facilitate the collection of and access to language resources.  
    7 Communication networks and computing power   Development and use of AI requires a sound communication infrastructure and access  to computing power. The  work on communication infrastructure, and on 5G networks  in particular, is a priority area for the Government. Access to sufficient computing  power will be secured through the use of national and international resources for high performance computing.   Developing and leveraging artificial intelligence   Norway will invest in AI in areas where we have distinct advantages, such as health,  seas and oceans, public administration, energy and mobility.   The Government wants Norwegian organisations to be attractive cooperation partners  for leading business and research communities in AI. Norway will continue to pursue  its investment in basic and applied ICT research. Policy instruments that stimulate  investment in strong research communities, such as the Research Cou ncil of Norway's  centre schemes, will be central to AI investments.   Artificial intelligence will have a dominant place in Horizon Europe, the EU's next  framework programme for research and innovation. Moreover, the EU has proposed  the establishment of a c omprehensive digitalisation programme, Digital Europe  Programme (DEP), for the period 2021 –2027. The programme will focus on initiatives in  high -performance computing and artificial intelligence. The Government has signed a  non-binding declaration of inten t to participate in Horizon Europe and will consider  Norway's participation in DEP from 2021.   Norway will have advanced skills, including in basic ICT research and AI research, in  order to understand and benefit from changes in technological developments. This  requires good study programmes that coincide with the needs of different sectors for  adva nced skills in artificial intelligence and in basic subjects such as statistics,  mathematics and information technology.   AI and related topics such as ethics and data protection associated with applications of  AI will also be important in areas such as la w and other professional programmes.  Institutions of higher education ought to evaluate how topics with relevance to artificial  intelligence can be integrated into their programmes in areas that will be affected by  artificial intelligence in the coming yea rs.  Technological development will lead to changes in the labour market, and the pace of  change is likely to accelerate. Opportunities for upskilling and reskilling  – both in the  workplace and in the form of study programmes – will therefore be increasingl y  important as applications of AI become more widespread in the labour market. The  Government will present a white paper on a skills reform, and has already begun work  on flexible further educational programmes both for digital skills and for employees  who  must adapt their skills as a result of digitalisation and the transition to a green  society .   Enhancing innovation capacity using artificial intelligence   The Government wants Norway to exploit the innovative potential of artificial  intelligence. Norway ca n take a leading position in applying artificial intelligence,  particularly in areas where we already are well positioned  and have strong research 
    8 and business communities, such as health, oil and gas, energy, the maritime and  marine industries and the pub lic sector.   The Government will consider how industrial policy instruments can best be designed  to support the potential value creation and use of AI in the business sector.   Public agencies ought to actively explore the potential of artificial intelligence , and  increased interaction between the public sector and the business sector should  promote innovation and value creation. The public sector ought to actively explore  opportunities in the market in connection with procurements, and innovative public  procu rements should be used where appropriate. To facilitate innovative solutions, the  agencies ought to focus on their needs  rather than on concrete products or services.   Responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence   Development and use of AI can also p resent challenges , in particular for AI that builds  on personal data. There is therefore a need for continuous discussion about what is  responsible and desirable development and about what can be done to prevent  adverse development.   The Government wants N orway to lead the way in developing and using AI with  respect for individual rights and freedoms. In Norway, artificial intelligence will be  based on ethical principles, respect for privacy and data protection and good cyber  security. Norway will continue to participate in European and international forums to  promote responsible and trustworthy use of AI.   About the strategy   The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence is intended for the civilian sector  – both  private and public . It does not cover the defence sector. The strategy focuses on  specifying what is meant by artificial intelligence and on describing some areas where  it will be important for Norway to exploit the opportunities offered by AI.   Artificial intelligence is an are a that is constantly evolving. For this reason, no specific  time period is applied to the strategy. There will be a need to adjust and evaluate the  strategy at appropriate intervals, in line with technological and social developments.   This strategy must also be viewed in connection with other important work by the  Government, such as the digitalisation strategy for the public sector1, a new public  administration act2, a review of the system of business -oriente d policy instruments3,  the skills reform  for lifelong learning  (Lære hele livet ), health data regulation4, and  several other small - and large -scale initiatives that are discussed in the strategy.                                                   1  Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation (2019): One digital public sector.

This strategy takes the definition proposed by the  European Commission's High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Int elligence5 as its  starting point, and defines AI as:   AI systems act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment,  processing and interpreting information and deciding the best action(s) to take to  achieve the given goal. Some AI systems can adapt their behaviour by analysing how the  environment is affected by their previous actions.   As a scientific discipline, artificial intelligence embraces various approaches and  technologies, such as machine learning (including, for example, deep learning and  reinforcement learning), machine reasoni ng (including planning, search and  optimisation), and certain methodologies in robotics (such as control, sensors , and  integration with other technologies in cyber physical systems).                                                    5  High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission (2019): A  definition of AI: Main capabilities and scientific disciplines  
    10     Figure 1: Simplified overview of AI's sub -disciplines   Source: Indepe ndent High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European  Commission (2019): A definition of AI: Main capabilities and disciplines.     'Strong' and 'weak' artificial intelligence   We are still a long way from a form of artificial intell igence that resembles human  intelligence, or artificial general intelligence (AGI). Artificial general intelligence is often  referred to as 'strong AI' while other forms are referred to as 'weak AI' or 'narrow AI'.   This does not mean that AI systems that a re designed for a specific 'narrow' area  cannot be powerful or effective, but they more often refer to specific systems designed  to perform a single task, such as image processing or pattern recognition, for specific  purposes. Nor is it the case that AI de veloped in parallel in many specific areas, or  research on 'weak AI', necessarily brings us closer to artificial general intelligence.   Our definition embraces both 'strong' and 'weak' artificial intelligence.   Rule -based systems for automation   A rule -base d IT system is often built on rule s such as 'IF x happens, THEN do Y'. Such  rules can be organised in complex decision trees. Rule -based automation systems can  be used to model regulations, business logic  or experience -based practice (exercise of  discretion). Many of the systems used for automated administrative processing in the  public sector are rule -based. Our definition of artificial intelligence covers some of  these systems, depending on factors such as the complexity of the rule set.   1.2 How does artificial intelligence work?   A system based on artificial intelligence can either interpret data from devices such as  sensors, cameras, microphones or pressure gauges or can be fed input data from  other in formation sources. The system analyses the data, makes decisions and  performs actions. Both the need for data and the fact that it is the system that makes  decisions and performs actions raise ethical issues that are discussed in chapter  5.  
    11 Some types of s ystems have a feedback loop which enables the artificial intelligence to  learn either from its own experiences or from direct feedback from users or operators.   The artificial intelligence system is usually embedded as a component within a larger  system. T asks are often performed digitally, as part of an IT system, but AI systems can  also be part of a physical solution, such as a robot.   Examples of current practical applications of AI are:    Computer vision/identification of objects in images: can be used for  purposes such as facial recognition or for identifying cancerous tumours.    Pattern recognition or anomaly detection: can be used to, for example,  expose bank or insurance fraud or to dete ct data security breaches.    Natural language processing (NLP): can be used to sort and categorise  documents and information, and to extract relevant elements from vast  datasets.    Robotics: can be used to develop autonomous vehicles such as cars, ships  and drones.     Development in some areas has progressed rapidly, and we are already seeing  systems being used in practice. Development and testing in other areas can take  longer to achieve reliable and verified results.   Machine learning   Today when we hear abo ut systems being based on artificial intelligence, they are  usually based on machine learning. Unlike rule -based systems, where rules are defined  by humans and are often based on expert experience, business logic or regulations,  the concept of machine lear ning covers a range of different technologies where the  rules are deduced from the data on which the system is trained.   In AI systems developed by machine learning, the machine learning algorithms build  mathematical models based on example data or trainin g data. These models are then  used to make decisions.   Machine learning algorithms usually learn in three different ways:    Supervised learning : the algorithm is trained with a dataset where both  input data and output data are given. In other words, the alg orithm is fed  both the 'task' and the 'solution' and uses them to build the model. This  will make it capable of making a decision based on input data.    Non-supervised learning : the algorithm is fed only a dataset without a  'solution' and must find patterns  in the dataset which then can be used to  make decisions about new input data. Deep learning algorithms can be  trained using non -supervised learning.    Reinforcement learning : the algorithm builds its model based on non supervised learning but receives feed back from the user or operator on  whether the decision it proposes is good or bad. The feedback is fed into  the system and contributes to improving the model.       
    12   Figure 2: The interrelationship between an AI system, its operator and environments.     Deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning. Today deep learning is an  important component in widely used solutions such as image processing, computer  vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Other areas of application  are: pharma ceutical development, recommendation systems (for music, films, etc.),  medical imaging processing, personalised medicine, and anomaly detection in a range  of areas. The most widely used deep learning frameworks have been developed by  Google (TensorFlow) an d Facebook (PyTorch).   Some deep learning algorithms are like  a 'black box', where one has no access to the  model that can explain why a given input value produces a given outcome. This is  discussed in more detail in chapter 5.     
                                  «Data urns» , Daniel Huber (AT)   Photo: Ars Electronica             13 The Government will facilitate world -class AI infrastructure in Norway in   the form of digitalisation -friendly regulations, good language resources,  fast and robust communication networks, and sufficient computing power.  It will facilitate data sharing within and across industries and sectors .  2 A good basis for AI 2.1 Data and data management   Data is vital to  AI. Today vast datasets are generated from many different sources. AI  and machine learning can use this data to provide  important insights. Access to high quality datasets is decisive for exploiting the potential of AI. The Government's goal is  to facilitate sharing of data from the public sector so that business and industry,  academia and civil society can use th e data in  new ways.   Data can be regarded as a renewable resource. Sharing data with others does not  mean that one is left with less data. In fact, the value of data can increase when shared  because it can be combined with other types of data that can offer new ins ights or be  used by organisations with the expertise to use the data in new and innovative ways.   Open public data   In principle, all information that is lawfully published on public websites can also be  made accessible as open data. Personal data that is e xempt from public disclosure or  that is subject to confidentiality must not, however, be made accessible unless specific  reasons apply for doing so. Weather data from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute  and traffic information from the Norwegian Public Roads Administration are examples  of open data from the public sector.   Personal data   The issues related to sharing and using data are closely connected to the type of data  involved. It is important to distinguish between  use of personal data and use of d ata  that cannot be traced back to specific individuals, such as weather data. Use of 
    14 personal data for developing AI raises a number of issues that must be addressed  before such data can be shared or used.   Data sharing principles   Principles for sharing ope n public data   Even though there is n o statutory obligation that requires open public data to be made  accessible , the Government's goal is for such data to be shared so that it can be used  by others (what we refer to as 'reuse').   Report to the Storting no.  27 (2015 –2016 ) Digital agenda for Norway: ICT for a simpler  everyday life and increased productivity  highlighted five sectors where reuse of open  public data is regarded to be of particular economic value: culture, research and  education, government expen diture, transport and communications, and maps and  property (geodata). Specific strategies have been developed for data sharing in these  areas. Furthermore, the Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Manage ment  (DFØ) has developed a system for publishi ng data pertaining to public expenditure.   The Freedom of Information Act regulates how public data should be made available  for reuse. Since 2012, the Digitalisation Circular has required government agencies  which establish new or upgrade existing IT-systems or digital services to make data  from these accessible in machine -readable formats. The agency should arrange for  data to be accessible in the long term, with integrity, authenticity, usability and  reliability intact.   The Nordic countries share many i nterests and values with respect to artificial  intelligence. The Nordic countries therefore cooperate through the Nordic Council of  Ministers in several areas related to AI. One of these areas concerns data. A working  group has been formed to identify data sets that can be exchanged between Nordic  countries and create added value for Nordic enterprises – public and private alike –  while still respecting the ethical aspects and the trust and values particular to the  Nordic countries.   One important measure in  the digitalisation strategy for the public sector6 is to  establish a national resource centre for data sharing in the Norwegian Digitalisation  Agency. The centre is intended to serve as a knowledge hub, and one of its tasks will be  to increase awareness a bout the value of sharing data.   Principles for data sharing between public -sector agencies   The Government has established a 'once only' principle to ensure that citizens and  businesses do not have to provide identical information to multiple public bodies .7  Updated and quality -assured information that is shared across public administrations  is a prerequisite for implementing the once -only principle, and is important for  developing better, more coherent public services.   Some  information is held in central registries, such as the National Population Register  and the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, but a lot of information exists  outside such registries. To facilitate sharing of this data between public agencies, the                                                   6  Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation (2019): One digital public sector.

    15 Brønnøysund R egister Centre and the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency have  established the National Data Directory to provide an overview of the types of data  held by various public agencies, how they are related, and what they mean. This  catalogue will also provide info rmation on whether data may be shared and on what  terms.   The Digitalisation Circular requires agencies to publish data that can be shared with  others in the National Data Directory and on data.norge.no .   Principles f or publicly funded research data   Research that is publicly funded should benefit everyone. It is therefore important that  research data  be made accessible to as many as possible; to other researchers as well  as to public administration and the business sec tor. Better access to research data can  boost innovation and value creation by enabling actors outside research communities  to find new areas of application. It can also contribute to smarter service development  in the public sector, opportunities for new business activities, and new jobs.   There is no doubt that far more datasets from research can be made accessible, along  with pertinent protocols, methods, models, software and source codes. Such access  must be safeguarded by sound data protection practices  and give due consideration to  security, intellectual property rights and business secrets. However, the vast and  growing amount of research data means that not all data can be a rchived  and  maintained for the same long periods. The costs of making datasets  genuinely  reusable must be weighed against the benefit to research communities and society.   The Government has presented  a strategy on access to and sharing of research data.8  The strategy sets out three basic principles for publicly funded research data  in  Norway:    Research data must be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary.    Research data should be managed and curated to take full advantage of  its potential value.    Decisions concerning the archiving and curation of research data must be  made within the research community.        Framework for data sharing in the industry sector   In Germany, a framework for sharing data in the industry sector, International  Data Spaces, was established in connection with the Industry 4.0 initiative. The  initiative has been expanded to industry sectors in other countries, and in Norway  SINTEF has enabled Norwegian companies to use the framework. The framework  offers a common infrastructure for the secure storage of industry data. The  framework offers companies contro l of their own data while enabling them to  share it if they wish to do so.

    16 Principles for data sharing in the business  sector   In principle, companies own their own data, and it is up to each company to decide  how it wants to use its data within the parameters of data protection regulations. Few  industries and businesses are aware of the value of data sharing. Many companies  have a poor overview of their own data, and therefore have neither categorised it nor  assessed its potential benefit to themselves or to other organisations.9  Norway has some examples of voluntary data sharing within the private sector and  between businesses and the public sector:    The oil and gas industry: In 1995 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate  and  the oil companies operating in the Norwegian continental shelf  established the Diskos National Data Repository (Diskos). Diskos is a  national data repository of information related to exploration and  extraction from the Norwegian shelf. The data is di rectly accessible online  to members of the Diskos joint venture. The idea behind Diskos is that the  oil companies should all cooperate on storing exploration data and  compete in interpreting it.10   Geodata: Norway Digital is a broad cooperation programme bet ween  agencies that are responsible for obtaining geospatial information and/or  that are large users of such information. The cooperation partners  comprise municipalities, counties, national agencies and private  enterprises such as telecom and power compani es.11 Geonorge.no  is a  national website that has been created for weather data and other  geospatial information in Norway under the Norway Digital partnership.     The authorities are generally hesitant about requiring  private enterprises to share data.  The Government's position is that private enterprises with a mutual interest in sharing  data should do so on their own initiative. Nonetheless, this can prove difficult to  achieve in practice.   The Government has set out t he following principles for sharing data from the  business sector:12    Voluntary data sharing is preferable, particularly between parties with a  mutual interest in sharing data.    The authorities can facilitate the sharing of data where the enterprises  themselves don't see the value in sharing if sharing such data would  enhance public benefit.    Data sharing may be imposed if necessary; for example for reasons of  public interest.    Data must be shared in such a way that individuals and business es retain  control of their own data. Privacy and business interests must be  safeguarded.                                                    9  Veritas Technologies LLC (2015): The Databerg Report: See what others don't   10 Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (2015): DISKOS  20 years of service for petroleum geology .   11 www.geonorge.no/en/   12 The principles are inspired by: Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (2019): Dutch  vision on data sharing between businesses   
    17 Some activities in the business sector are performed for the public sector or under  permits or licences granted by public authorities. Public agencies have taken litt le  advantage of opportunities to set requirements for data access or sharing in  connection with entering into contracts or awarding licences. The Government will  therefore consider whether the public sector can contribute to making more datasets  from the b usiness sector accessible by setting requirements for data sharing in  conjunction with entering into public contracts wherever appropriate. The Government  will also consider evaluating requirements to make data publicly accessible in licensing  areas where such access is considered to be of particular benefit to society.   Methods of sharing data   A variety of methods are available that can make it simpler and safer to share data  between different stakeholders:   Data lakes   A data lake is a central repository for storing data, such as a cloud service. The data can  be stored as is, in its original format, and can be a combination of structured and  unstructured data. The data need not be structured or labelled. The data lake ca n then  be used to retrieve data for machine learning or for other analyses.   Data trusts   A data trust is a legal structure where a trusted third party is responsible for the data  to be shared. The third party decides which data should be shared with whom,  in  compliance with the purpose for which the data trust was set up.   Anonymisation interface   An anonymisation interface allows various analyses to be carried out on register data  containing personal data from multiple data sources without being able to id entify  individuals. The Remote Access Infrastructure for Register Data (RAIRD) is a  cooperation project between the Norwegian Social Science Data Services and Statistics  Norway on such an anonymisation interface. The information model for RAIRD is  openly a ccessible and can be used by anyone.13  Synthetic data   Synthetic data can in many cases be an alternative to identifiable data or anonymised  data. If synthetic datasets can be produced with the same features as the original  dataset, they can be used to trai n algorithms or be used as test data. This means that  even datasets which normally would be considered sensitive could be made openly  accessible for use in research and innovation.   Common open application programming interfaces   An application programming  interface (API) makes it possible to search directly in a  data source to retrieve the desired data. This is a prerequisite for being able to use  data in real time. The Digitalisation Circular establishes that public agencies must make  appropriate informat ion available in machine -readable and preferably standardised  formats, ideally using APIs.                                                    13 RAIRD Information Model RIM v1_0 accessible at  https://statswiki.unece.org/display/gsim/RAIRD+Information+Model+RIM+v1_0  
    18 Generation of synthetic test data for the National Registry   The Norwegian Tax Administration is in the process of developing a solution in  which machine learning is used to generate rich synthetic test data in a dedicated  test environment for the National Registry. The synthetic National Registry will  offer synthet ic test subjects in addition to simulating events. The objective is to  allow enterprises that use information from the National Registry to test their  integrations without using authentic personal data in the tests. Initially the  synthetic National Registr y will be made available to parties needing  to test  integration with the National Registry. Eventually it will be available to everyone  who needs National Registry data for testing purposes.   Source: Norwegian Tax Administration   White paper on the data -driven economy   The Government will prepare a white paper on data sharing and the data -driven  economy. The white paper will discuss important issues such as data ownership,  incentives for sharing data, and possibilities for equitable sharing of the eco nomic  gains from a global digital data economy. Other important issues are data protection,  secure data sharing, and ethical use of data. The white paper will also discuss issues  relating to competence in data science and data sharing, and to infrastructur e for data  capture and sharing.   As part of the work on preparing the white paper, the Minister of Digitalisation will  appoint an expert group to examine the prerequisites and terms for sharing data  within and from the business sector.       The Government w ill      present a white paper on the data -driven economy and innovation    establish a resource centre for data sharing, with expertise in the relation ship  between law, technology , business and administrative processes    establish a set of principles for extracting and managing data from central  registries, and a common API catalogue to promote better utilisation of basic  data by providing an overview of data interfaces (APIs)    consider policy instruments that can make it easier for industry sectors to  shar e data and that simultaneously safeguard privacy and data protection,  security, and business interests    give guidance to public agencies on how they can ensure access to data when  entering into contracts by, for example, proposing standard clauses    conside r which areas it may be in the public interest to require that data from  the business sector be made accessible, and examine whether requirements  for data access in connection with licences might be a suitable policy  instrument in this regard    
    19 2.2  Language data and language resources   Language technology in the form of, for example, speech recognition and language  comprehension, represents a key component in AI. Natural language processing (NLP)  involves registering natural language (text/audio) and understanding the meaning and  context . Natural language generation (NLG) involves producing text based on data.  These technologies combined are important in the development of virtual assistants  and in analyses based on unstructured data.   To make systems like these accessible in written Norw egian and Sami and in dialects,  the technology must be adapted to these languages and to local conditions. This  requires language resources.   Språkbanken, a service provided by the National Library of Norway, makes language  data available for developing la nguage technology in Norwegian. The National Library  of Norway and the Language Council of Norway will cooperate by coordinating their  efforts to further develop the resources held in Språkbanken. They also have a  responsibility to make sure that the publi c sector as buyer, and developer  communities in both the public and private sectors, be informed about and request  these language resources.   The Sami languages are particularly vulnerable. Language technology and language  technology resources in Sami are important for contributing to future development  and use of the language and eventually for developing services in Sami based on  artificial intelligence. Divvun and Giellatekno, the research group for Saami language  technology at the Arctic University of N orway, are both developing different language  technology tools for Sami. The Government will return to the issue of Sami language  data and language resources in a white paper on Sami language, culture and society.  The main topic of the white paper will be digitalisation.   One of the challenges in the work on facilitating language technology in Norwegian  and Sami is obtaining sufficient amounts of language data within different domains,   such as medicine, ICT and transport. There is a need for both written an d oral data that  covers dialects and pronunciation variations. Examples of useful resources include     Analysis and classification of unstructured data in the MFA   Every year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) receives up to  6,000 reports from  Norwegian embassies, delegations, etc. Previously it was extremely difficult to  navigate all this information. Since the MFA adopted machine learning and NLP to  analyse and classify the content of these documents, it has been possible t o find  almost all relevant information on a given subject matter. The solution is also  used to extract key information in reports and prepare summaries.   In the work on developing this solution, the MFA cooperated with the University of  Oslo, which provide d solutions for categorising the Norwegian language. The plan  is to gradually expand the solution with information from archives and external  research reports.   Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs  
    20 multilingual terminology lists, area -specific texts and speech recordings or parallel  texts in different languages. The linguistic structures in text produced by the public  sector constitute valuable data for language technology research and development. I t  is important to facilitate reuse for these purposes.   There is reason to believe that the public sector possesses far more data that could be  used in developing language technology than it realises. The Government will there fore promot e awareness of language data and language resources in the public sector  by, among other things, addressing  such data specifically in the Digitalisation Circular.   The Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation has strengthened the infor mation manageme nt resource centre  in the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency in order  to facilitate closer cooperation with the National Library and the Language Council of  Norway . The agencies will cooperate  on strategies to ensure that public language  resources can be used  for language technology purposes , guidance on what can be  regarded as language resources and on ensuring  deposits of language resources for  Språkbanken.     Language technology aids   Tuva is an aid for dictating text (speech recognition) and navigating a PC  using  voice control. The product was developed by Max Manus in 2017 and is provided  to people with permanent disabilities. The solution uses AI and builds on  resources from Språkbanken. The dataset developed specially for this system is  now openly accessi ble to other developers in Språkbanken.   eTranslation is a machine translation service developed by the EU  that can be  used by the public sector in the EEA area. The functionality for Norwegian is built  on translations by the Unit for EEA Translation Servic es in the M FA, translations by  Semantix for public agencies and from standards translated by Standard Norway.  Språkbanken makes the datasets accessible to developers and researchers .

    21 2.3 Regulations   Norway has a tradition for modernising its legal framework  to meet new technological  developments, starting with the eRegulation project14 in 2000. The aim is to make laws  and regulations as technology -neutral as possible so that they can be applied even  when new technologies and digitalisation change our society and the way we live.   At the same time, we often see that regulation is called f or when new technologies give  rise to problematic applications. We have seen examples of this with artificial  intelligence in connection with electoral manipulation in social media and 'deep fakes'.  However, it is challenging – and often inexpedient – to regulate a technology that is still  in an early phase. Regulating too early can have unintended consequences on  developments, disrupt  the market and reduce the potential for innovation. Moreover,  any technology will often have both positive and negative app lications. The same  underlying technology used to produce deep fakes can also be used to, for example,  create synthetic data, a technology that helps protect personal data.   Digitalisation -friendly regulations   The Government wants the legal framework to  reflect the opportunities and challenges  that come with new technology, including artificial intelligence. It also wants  regulations to be digitalisation friendly. Regulations ought to facilitate fully and partly  automated administrative proceedings and not contain unnecessary discretionary  provisions.15 Regulations suitable for automated administrative proceedings ought to  be machine -readable  so that they can be  used AI -systems .   There is a need to consider whether there are areas where regulations impose  inexpedient and adverse limitations on the development and use of artificial  intelligence. Among other things, there is a need to review laws that apply to some  public agencies to see how the regulations can better facilitate sharing and using data  and develo ping and using artificial intelligence.   Such a process will require thoroughly reviewing sector -specific regulations and  drawing on cross -sectoral expertise so that consideration is given to society's needs,  the individual's right to privacy, and the tech nological possibilities. This work must be  viewed in connection with the regulatory review aimed at removing barriers to  digitalisation and innovation, as discussed in the Government's digital strategy for the  public sector.   Areas that create particular ch allenges:   Interoperability   The fact that different sector -specific regulations use the same concepts in different  ways can present challenges. Income , for example, does not mean the same in the  Norwegian Tax Administration as it does in the Norwegian Labo ur and Welfare  Administration (NAV), and the concept of co-habitant  is defined in a variety of ways in  different regulations. The Government aims to achieve semantic interoperability in its                                                   14 Ot.prp. nr. 108 (2000 -2001) Om lov om endringer i diverse lover for å fjerne hindringer for elektronisk  kommunikasjon [Draft resolution and bill to amend various acts in order to remove obstacles for  electronic communication]   15 Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation (2019): One digital public sector .

    22 legislation to make it easier to be read by machines and used for artificial intelligence.  If concepts do not have the same meaning, it is important to have information on this  to prevent the system from producing misleading results.   Personal data: consent and statutory authority   Personal  data is covered by the Personal  Data Act. The principle of purpose limitation  means that the purpose for processing personal data must be clearly stated and  established when the data is collected. This is fundamental to ensuring that individuals  have control of their data and can give informed consent to data processing.  Development and use of artificial intelligence often require different types of personal  data; data which in some cases was originally collected for other purposes. Moreover,  processing of data – such as health data – may be subject to other regulations, such as  the Health Registries Act.   The most widespread way of gaining lawful access to personal data for use in AI is  consent . Consent is often obtained by the users' approving an end user agreement and  consenting to dat a processing when they want to use a service. The agreement should  state, among other things, how the entity will use the data collected and with whom it  may be shared. It must also be possible to withdraw consent, and some services allow  end users to admi nister how their personal data is used in more detail.   The public sector often collects and processes personal data without the explicit  consent of the user. In such cases, collection is based on a statutory provision  that  provides legal basis to collect and use data on citizens for specific purposes . Norway  currently has no common system whereby citizens can see what information is  collected and administered by the public sector, though solutions have been  established in some important areas, such as helsenorge.no . Here users can  administer which healthcare personnel may access their summary care record and  clinical documents; withdraw their consent to be registered in certain health registries;   and grant power of attorney to family members.   Datasets that are based on consent will in most cases be incomplete or contain bias  that may influence the outcome of any analyses performed on the data. This is an  important reason for having central regist ries where registration is statutory and  mandatory.   When personal data is collected pursuant to a statutory provision, opportunities to use  the data for purposes other than the original purpose are limited unless the new use is  also permitted by a statuto ry provision. This means that public agencies have little  scope to use the data they collect to perform analyses on their own activities using AI  beyond the statutory authority provided for the relevant dataset. The Government  wants to expand the scope for  public agencies to use their data to develop and use AI.   Regulatory challenges in the health area   There may be a need to develop regulatory frameworks in some health -related areas  before testing of methods based on AI takes place. Other areas are already  safeguarded under existing regulations. For example, algorithms used in medical  equipment software,  such as surgical robots or software for enhancing or processing  images in diagnostic imaging instruments, are subject to regulation of medical  equipment. The Norwegian Medicines Agency provides guidance and supervises  compliance with regulations governing  such equipment in the Norwegian market.  
    23 Development and use of tools based on artificial intelligence are dependent on  information from sources beyond the individual patients who receive health care in a  specific case. Use of data for patient treatment a nd use of patient data for research  purposes (secondary use) are currently regulated differently. The current regulations  provide no clear legal basis for using health data pertaining to one patient to provide  healthcare to the next patient unless the pati ent gives consent. However, exemption  from the duty of confidentiality may be granted to use patient data for research  purposes. Artificial intelligence challenges the distinction between research purposes  and patient treatment because there is often a nee d to include patient data from  research when AI -based tools developed in a research project are used to provide  treatment. Exemption from the duty of confidentiality will no longer apply in such  cases, and the use of personal data will no longer be legally  permitted.   In July 2019 the Ministry of Health and Care Services distributed a proposal for  consultation regarding access to health data and other health -related data in health  registries.16 The proposal concerns access to health data for use in statistic s, health  analyses, research, quality improvement, planning, management and emergency  preparedness in order to promote health, prevent disease and injury, and provide  better health and care services.   The Ministry of Health and Care Services is also consid ering amendments to  regulations governing access to health data in connection with teaching and quality  assurance. This work includes reviewing permission to use health data in decision  support tools. Moreover, the Norwegian Directorate of Health, the Dire ctorate of  eHealth and the Norwegian Medicines Agency have, in consultation with the regional  health authorities, been tasked with identifying the opportunities and challenges  posed by artificial intelligence and what adaptations in regulatory conditions a t  national level night be needed.   In the long term, more tasks which today are performed by healthcare personnel may  be performed by autonomous systems and artificial intelligence. Relevant examples  span from automatic generation of patient records, patie nt logistics and fleet  management of the ambulance service to autonomous surgical robots. Although the   scope of automation and autonomous tools will expand in the health sector, health  personnel will still be responsible for ensuring proper provision of he althcare.     Health analysis platform   The Government will establish a health analysis platform, a national system for  making health data accessible for research purposes and for other, secondary  uses. The platform will allow more advanced analysis of Norwegian health data  and will form the basis for new types of medical and health research. Among  other things, it will allow health data to be used more actively in developing  medicines and medical technology.

    24 Regulatory sandboxes   Regulatory sandboxes are first and foremost a policy instrument for promoting  responsible innovation. A regulatory sandbox is intended to give enterprises  opportunities to test new technologies and/or business models within specific  parameters. In this strategy the concept is used to refer to:    legislative amendments that allow trials, for example subject to  application, usually within a limited geographical area or time period    more comprehensive measures in areas where close monitorin g and  supervision is needed, usually by the relevant supervisory authority     The concept of regulatory sandboxes is best known in the financial sector, where  supervisory authorities in several countries have given enterprises opportunities to  test specific products, technologies or services on a limited number of customers for a  limited time period and under close monitoring. In December 2019 the Norwegian  financial supervisory authority (Finanstilsynet) established a regulatory sandbox for  financial technol ogy (fintech). The purpose of the sandbox is to expand Finanstilsynet’s  understanding of new technological solutions in financial markets, while at the same  time expanding enterprises' understanding of regulatory requirements and how they  are applied to ne w business models, products and services.   However, it makes little sense to talk about one regulatory sandbox for AI. AI solutions  do not represent a homogeneous group of services, and are subject to a broad  spectrum of regulations and regulatory authorit ies, depending on their purpose and  functionality.   The Government has already established regulatory sandboxes in the area of  transportation, in the form of legislative amendments that allow testing activities. An  act has been introduced allowing pilot pr ojects on autonomous vehicles. The act  entered into force on 1 January 2018.17 The Norwegian maritime authorities  established the first test bed for autonomous vessels as early as 2016. A further two  test beds have since been approved.18 In 2019 the Storting adopted a new  Harbours  and Fairways Act19 which, subject to application, permits  autonomous coastal shipping.  Such permission allows sailing in specific fairways subject to compulsory pilotage or in  areas where no pilotage services are provided.   Where pilot projects depart from applicable laws and regulations, they can be  conducted with statutory authority in special laws, as in the examples mentioned, or in  the Pilot Schemes in Public Administration Act. Under the Pilot Schemes, public   administration can apply to the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation to  depart from laws and regulations in order to test new ways of organising their  activities or performing their tasks for a period of up to four years. In the white paper  on innovation in the public sector we will consider whether the Pilot Schemes allows  sufficient scope to test new solutions based on AI.                                                    17 LOV -2017 -12-15-112 Lov om utprøving av selvkjørende kjøretøy [Act relating to testing self -driving  vehicles]   18 Sjøfartsdirektoratet (2017): Horten blir testområde for autonome skip  [Norwegian Maritime Authority  (2017): Horten to be test bed for autonomous ships ]. www.sdir.no/en/    19 LOV -2019 -06-21-70 Lov om havner og farvann (havne - og farvannsloven) §25 [Act relating to  Harbours and Fairways, section 25]  
    25 Investment in autonomous ships   The Norwegian shipping industry is at the forefront of developing and exploiting  new technologies. Norway will have the world's first commercially operated  autonomous ship: Yara Birkeland. On commission from Yara, the Kongsberg  Group is supplying equipment  for the world's first electric, zero -emissions,  autonomous container ship. The ship will transport fertiliser from Yara's factory  on Herøya to the ports of Brevik and Larvik. The ship, which is due to be delivered  in 2020, will gradually move from manned operation to fully autonomous  operation with remote monitoring in 2022. The ship will replace a substantial  volume of road haulage (estimated at 40,000 truck journeys annually), emit fewer  greenhouse gas emissions, improve local air quality and produce les s noise.   In addition, NorgesGruppen (ASKO) has received funds from ENOVA (NOK 119  million) to establish an autonomous transport chain across the Oslo fjord,  between Moss and Holmestrand. Two sea drones will then replace 150 daily  (approximately 50,000 ann ual) truck journeys between Østfold and Vestfold.  These all -electric, autonomous transport ferries are scheduled for commission in  2024.   Sources: Norwegian Maritime Authority/Yara and Enova     The Government will establish a regulatory sandbox for data protection under the  remit of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority. This will fulfil several purposes:    Enterprises can gain a better understanding of the regulatory  requirements placed on data protection and reduce the time from  development and testing to actually rolling out AI solutions to the market.  Systems that are rolled out after being developed in t he sandbox can  serve as leading examples, and can help other enterprises that are  interested in developing similar systems.    The authorities can gain a better understanding of new technological  solutions and more easily identify potential risks and problem s at an early  stage so that guidance material can be produced to clarify how the  regulations should be applied.    The authorities and industries can identify sectors with a need for their  own industry standards.    Individuals and society as a whole will benef it from new and innovative  solutions being developed within responsible parameters.     The Government is positive towards developing new regulatory sandboxes in different  areas. Responsibility for such regulatory sandboxes ought to lie with the communities  best qualified to test new systems. In some areas, such as further development of  smart cities and autonomous transport systems, it may be natural for this respon sibility to lie with local and regional authorities or other enterprises  communities.    
    26 The I nformation Commissioner's Office's regulatory sandbox   The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK is testing a regulatory  sandbox designed to support development of products and services that are  innovative and widely beneficial. Organisations can have the way they use  personal data in their systems  reviewed and assessed. ICO can provide some  comfort from enforcement action during the testing and development phases of  their systems. ICO wants to work on products and services that are at the cutting  edge of development and that operate in areas where there is genuine  uncertainty about how regulations should be interpreted.   Following an open application process, the ICO selected 10 organisations of  varying types and sizes and from different sectors to be provided with free,  professional guidance from I CO staff. One of the successful applicants is  Heathrow Airport's project to assess whether facial recognition technology can be  used for checking in, security checks, self -service bag drops, etc. to create a  frictionless journey through the airport. Anothe r project selected comes from  TrustElevate, which is developing a model using AI for age -checking children and  young people under 16 in connection with accessing social media.   Source: The Norwegian Data Protection Authority   Public Administration Act and Archival Act   The reports published by the Law Commission on the Archival Act20 and by the Law  Commission on the Public Administration Act21 will both have a bearing on public sector administrative proceedings and on the use of AI in public administration.   Administrative proceedings in the public sector are highly regulated, though some  degree of discretionary assessment may be exercised in the process. This means that a  system does not have to be either manual or automated. It can have solutions where  only e xceptional cases are processed manually or have processes where an executive  officer must examine certain points in order to make an assessment, but where the  rest of the process is automated and rule -based. Many public -sector administrative  proceedings ar e already automated. There are case management systems with  integrated application dialogue making it possible  to make automated decisions  immediately.   A feature common to all of the current automated case management systems is that  they are rule -based. T he regulations are programmed into the solution, making it  possible to give reasons for the decisions made. The Public Administration Act requires  grounds to be given for all decisions  affecting individuals . This obligation to state  grounds is important fo r safeguarding citizens' opportunities to verify and check  decisions made concerning them.                                                      20 NOU 2019: 9 Fra kalveskinn til datasjø – Ny lov om samfunnsdokumentasjon og arkiver  [Official  Norwegian Report on a new Archiva l Act]   21 NOU 2019: 5 Ny forvaltningslov – Lov om saksbehandlingen i offentlig forvaltning (forvaltningsloven) .  [Official Norwegian Report on a new Public Administration Act]  
    27 NOU 2019: 5 Ny forvaltningslov [New Public Administration Administration Act]   The Law Commission on the Public Administration Act was appointed in 2015 and  submit ted its report in the spring of 2019. A central element in the commission's  mandate was 'to draft an act that facilitates and builds on the fact that most  administrative proceedings are performed, or will be performed, digitally'.   The commission points ou t that automat ed decision -making can generate  substantial efficiency gains, particularly where case volumes are large. Auto mation can also promote equal treatment, given that everyone who  is in the same  situation , according to the system criteria, is automatically treated equally.  Automation enables consistent implementation of regulations and can prevent  unequal practice. Automated administrative proceedings can also enhance  implementation of rights and obligatio ns; for example, by automatically making  decisions that grant benefits when the conditions are met. This can particularly  benefit the most disadvantaged in society. More consistent imple men tation of  obligations can lead to higher levels of compliance and  to a per ception among  citizens that most people contribute their share, which in turn can help build trust.   Wherever there is a need to exercise discretion, rule -based systems can filter out  cases or checkpoints for manual assessment. The commission points out that  machine learning can offer new possibilities for automating assessment criteria.   The majority of the commission proposes that statutory authority be provided in  the regulations to allow administrative bodies in specific areas to make decisi ons  using fully automated administrative proceedings. Decisions with a low impact on  individuals may be made without providing statutory authority in regulations. The  commission also proposes that the administrative body must document the legal  content of automated decision -making systems. Such information should be  made public unless laws , regulations or special considerations dictate otherwise.   The Law Commission on the Public Administration Act sees the difficulty in  implementing cohesive services witho ut sharing data across agencies. The  absence of authority to share information can make it difficult to organise the  public administration appropriately, and prevent full automation of administrative  proceedings in areas that lend themselves to this. The c ommission therefore  proposes that authority be given to share confidential information with other  administrative bodies on a need -to-know basis. This constitutes a broader  application than current laws.   Source : NOU 2019: 5 Ny forvaltningslov - Lov om saks behandlingen i offentlig forvaltning  (forvaltningsloven)     There is huge potential to increase the use of artificial intelligence in public -sector  administrative proceedings in the form of both rule -based systems and machine  learning. The Law Commission on  the Public Administration Act emphasizes that  automation can promote equal treatment and consistent implementation of  regulations. Nonetheless, when case management systems containing AI elements are  implemented, the algorithm's judgement must be at least  as sound and as trustworthy 
    28 as the human discretion it replaces. To ensure this, we need systems that are  transparent and explainable.   In its report, the Law Commission on the Archival Act points to the importance of  ensur ing that AI -driven processes and decisions are documented and that the  documentation is protected in ways that render it authentic and usable. Existing  archiving procedures, archiving systems and archiving institutions in the public sector  are currently not e quipped to address this challenge. The commission therefore  recommends that consideration be given to how archiving functionality can be built  into the administrative processes and to identify any specific aspects resulting from  the use of artificial intel ligence.   Artificial intelligence can also be used to achieve better, more efficient classification  and sorting of information and thereby simplify and improve record -keeping and  archiving practices in the future.                 The Government will      review and assess regulations that hamper appropriate and desired use of  artificial intelligence in the public and private sectors    set requirements for transparency and accountability in new public  administration systems in which AI is part of the solutio n   establish an advisory body and a regulatory sandbox in the area of privacy and  data protection    be receptive to requests from public and private enterprises to establish more  regulatory sandboxes    establish a health analysis platform to streamline and simp lify access to health  data for research and analysis and simultaneously strengthen privacy and data  protection    facilitate more active use of health data for testing the effects and safety of  medicines and medical technology       
    29 2.4 Infrastructure: networks  and computing power   Deployment of the electronic communication networks   The electronic communication networks, and the mobile communication networks in  particular, are a cornerstone in the digital transformation of society. Norway has a  well-developed fou rth-generation (4G) mobile network with excellent coverage. There  are plans to deploy a nationwide 5G network in the Norwegian mobile market by  2023.22 This will be important for leveraging the opportunities that lie in 5G technology  and 5G networks, not le ast as an underlying technology for the Internet of Things (IoT).   IoT is a term often used to refer to the ever increasing amount of sensors connected to  the internet. It can cover everything from mobile phones and private smart home  solutions to sensors measuring air  pollution,  water quality, noise levels, and so on. The  data can be used in predictive maintenance, decision processes and development of  new business models. IoT solutions are already deployed in today's 4G networks, but  because 5G is faster than 4G , has better capacity and detect weaker signals, it will play  a significant role in the development of IoT. Better  capacity is particularly important in  densely populated areas.   5G infrastructure will therefore be important for implementing a full -scale realisation  of IoT with a capacity that cannot be delivered by today's technology. This will enable   completely new applications in different sectors of society, such as transport, health  and care, and smart cities.   The mobile networks will be a vital enabling technology for AI, due not only to their  role as a communication infrastructure but also to the vast amount of communication  data generated by producing the services. Anonymis ed metadata from the mobile  networks can be used as input in systems that use AI for analysis, improving the  underlying data for decision -support , and processes  controls . Such data is already  commercially available from mobile network operators (Telenor, T elia and Ice). Use of  such data falls under  a range of regulations, both sectoral laws and the Personal Data  Act. The Government will monitor developments in this area and consider how to  facilitate more  use of this data.   In the transport sector, deploymen t of the electronic communication networks,  expansion of IoT technology and access to anonymised metadata from communication  will represent key elements in leveraging the opportunities that lie in AI, such as:    self-driving and autonomous cars, buses, truc ks, drones, trains and ships    intelligent traffic management, controlling and influencing behaviour in  traffic    early warning of the need to make replace ments  and maintain  infrastructure    prediction of travel behaviour    more advanced route optimisation                                                      22 Telia (2019): Telia skal bygge ut et nasjonal 5G -nett i løpet av 2023  [Telia to  deploy a national 5G  network by the end of 2023]. Press release, 8 October 2019  
    30 Transport and communication infrastructure is also a key element in the development  of smart cities and municipalities. Smart city solutions such as personalised  health  services, smart energy supply, and building  management systems  based on  big data  and AI  will depend on fast and robust electronic communication networks.   The Government wants to accelerate the pace of further broadband deployment. The  draft legislation on broadband deployment includes measures to facilitate the  common use of existing physic al infrastructure; measures to ensure that developers of  mobile and broadband networks receive information on, and can participate in,  ongoing and planned building and construction projects; and measures to ensure that  developers receive information on exi sting physical infrastructure. The new act will  require new buildings and buildings that undergo renovation to be made ready to  connect to high -speed networks.   The Government will present a white paper on electronic communication.   High -performance comput ing (HPC)   The amount of d ata in many areas of research and public administration is growing  rapidly. In addition to experiments and theory development , calculations and data driven research have become important work methods  for researchers . This creates a   growing need not only for storing and accessing data, but also for the computing  power to process th e data. Scientific calculations make it possible to analyse and  identify new theoretical relationships in the vast datasets generated by, for example,  gene tic sequencing, satellite observations or research vessels.   Many research projects that process large datasets can use local resources or buy  capacity from one of the large cloud service providers. If the chosen provider stores  and processes data in compl iance with the General Data Protection Regulation, most  unclassified data can be processed in cloud services. Use of cloud services from large  commercial players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft offer more capacity (for storage  and computing power) and va rious commercially available analytical tools.   However, these services are often insufficient for processing large r datasets or data  requiring large -scale parallel calculations. S uch s ituations call for larger computing  resources, which are more cost -effective to establish at national or international level.  UNINETT AS develops and operates Norway's high -speed research and education  network. UNINETT'S subsidiary, UNINETT Sigma2, is responsible for procuring,  operating and maintaining national resources for  HPC  and data storage in Norway.   For some research areas, such as astrophysics and marine research, the datasets are  so large and require such high computing speeds that our national resources lack the  necessary capacity. We are dependent on cooperation an d on buying capacity in  international consortia. Such high -performance computing centres can have up to 100  times more capacity than the national resources.   In 2017 the European Commission took the initiative to establish the European High Performance Com puting Joint Undertaking (EuroPHC), which is jointly funded by the  European Commission and national contributions. From 2021 Norway's continued  participation in EuroPHC will depend on Norway's participation in the Horizon Europe  framework programme and the Digital Europe Programme (DEP). UNINETT Sigma2 is  Norway's national competence centre for high -performance computing in the EuroHPC  partnership.  
    31 HPC produces vital knowledge about major societal challenges   Life cycle assessments and mat erial flow analyses are key elements for gaining an  overall picture of the environmental impacts of different products from cradle to  grave. Such analyses demand large datasets and immense computing power.  Combining data from the oceans with atmospheric me asurements will provide a  better data source for climate modelling. Climate models require increasingly  higher resolution in time and space, and thereby more calculations, if they are to  provide the necessary local insights into how climate change will aff ect the risk of  floods, land slides and extreme weather.   Similarly, modelling of space weather will be essential for avoiding paralysis of  critical infrastructure by severe solar storms.   Health research has been revolutionised in recent years by genetic sequencing  and advanced algorithms, which in turn have opened the door to personalised  medicine and new advanced forms of treatment. These methods generate vast  amounts of sensitive data that must be analysed by high -performance computers  and stored in hig hly secure environments.   Source: Ministry of Education and Research     Some areas require high levels of cyber security while simultaneously allowing the data  to be processed efficiently. Relevant examples are high -resolution MR images, DNA  data, videos of patients and other sensitive data. Solutions for storing and processing  such data are mainly provided through the Service for Sensitive Data (TSD), which is  operated and developed through collaboration between the University of Oslo and  UNINETT Sigma2.   Norwegian data centres as a resource for AI   Cloud services are fundamental for enabling enterprises to exploit the potential of AI  technology. Cloud services provide access to computing power and frameworks for  machine learning , which are not available  locally.   Many factors are driving the increase in data, among them IoT and the possibility to  perform more and increasingly advanced analyses on complex data so urces. This  increases the demand for storage and processing capacity 'in the cloud', which in turn  increases the need to establish more data centres.   The Government wants Norway to be perceived as an attractive host country for data  centres and other data -driven  industry. A national data centre strategy was published   in 2018.23 Several measures laid out in the strategy, such as reduced electricity supply  costs for data centres, removal of the 'machinery tax' and a more straightforward site  zoning process fo r data centres, have made Norway even more attractive to the data  centre industry. Clean energy, good communications infrastructure and political and  geological stability are other important arguments for choosing Norway as a host  country for data centres.                                                    23 Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries (2018): Powered by Nature – Norway as a data centre  nation. Strategy  
    32 The number of data centres established in Norway has grown in recent years. Many  Norwegian data centres have major international customers, and several large  international cloud service providers have opted to establish their own data centres in  Norway. W e are also witnessing a trend whereby customers – including international  companies – are moving tasks that require large amounts of computing power to  Norwegian data centres because they can offer scalable capacity based on renewable  energy. This is a pos itive trend from a business perspective, and provides Norway's  business and public sectors with a wider choice of suppliers. It is particularly important  for enterprises with stringent latency requirements or that process data that needs to  be stored  and p rocessed in Norway due to legal requirements (e.g. The National  Security Act) .                 The Government will      consider how to facilitate increased use of anonymised metadata from the  mobile networks    present a bill on broadband deployment that will contribute to accelerating  the pace of deployment of high -speed networks in Norway    facilitate the rapid rollout of 5G    present a white paper on electronic communication    consider further participation in EuroHPC in connection with Horizon Europe  and the Dig ital Europe Programme (DEP)    establish a marketplace for cloud services which will, among other things,  guide public agencies on procuring cloud services, with particular focus on  security    follow up the data centre strategy Powered by Nature Strategy: Norway as a data  centre nation  
                                  «Inside Me », Dimitry Zakharov (RU)   Photo: Ars Electronica                 33 Norway will focus on artificial intelligence in areas  where we have  competitive advantages, such as health, seas and oceans, public  administration, energy and mobility. Policy instruments that stimulate  investment in strong research communities, such as the centre  schemes, will be important elements.   The Go vernment wants Norwegian research communities to be  attractive partners for leading AI enterprises and research  communities through continued investment in basic and applied ICT  research, good study programmes and competence building in AI  through courses and further education programmes at all levels.   3 Developing and leveraging AI     Norway will have advanced expertise in basic ICT research and AI research in order to  understand and benefit from changes in technological developments. Norwegian  communities will be attractive partners for leading business and research  communities .  Norway will invest in research and development in artificial intelligence within the long term priority areas in the Government's long -term plan for research and higher  education: seas and oceans, environment, environmentally friendly energy, health,  public administration and civil protection.   The EU framework programmes for research and innovation represents important  arenas for cooperation and a n important source of funding for Norwegian enterprises  and institutions. In the future, too, the aim is for national policy instruments to  stimulate participation in and qualification for any European programmes Norway  chooses to join.   The EU framework pr ogrammes also open the door to cooperation with countries on  other continents. Norway has entered into bilateral government agreements with  selected countries to strengthen cooperation with strong research nations. The aim is  to promote cooperation in prio rity areas, including AI.   The Government's goal is that investments in artificial intelligence within research,  research -based innovation and development should be concentrated on strong  
    34 research communities where cooperation between academia and industry is central,  such as in the centres of excellence and the centres for research -based innovation.   Higher education programmes should correspond to needs for advanced expertise in  the diffe rent sectors, both for competence in AI and  in basic subjects such as statistics,  mathematics and information technology.   Overviews of courses and further education programmes in artificial intelligence will  be readily available. In school, d igital skills , digital literacy  and basic understanding of  technology will be given prominence already at primary and lower secondary level. A  basic introduction to artificial intelligence will be made available to the general  population.   3.1 Research and higher educa tion   Research   There has been solid growth in research and development in ICT in recent years, with a  nominal increase from NOK 8 billion in 2007 to NOK 18 billion in 2017. Industry  accounts for the largest share of R&D investment in ICT, and most of this  comprises  development activities. More recently, however (2015 –2017), the strongest growth has  been in the university and university college sector.24    Figure 3: Consumption of ICT R&D   Source: Statistics Norway and NIFO, R&D statistics. Research Council of  Norway (2019): Report on  science and technology indicators for Norway     In 2018 the Government allocated a total of NOK 9.9 billion to the Research Council of  Norway, approximately NOK 1.4 billion of which was allocated to research, innovation  and advanced  applications of ICT. The Research Council of Norway has no  programmes dealing specifically with AI, but AI has been one of several priorities in the  IKTPLUSS initiative. Calculations from 2019 show that over 40 per cent of the Research                                                   24 Research Council of Norway (2019): Report on science and t echnology indicators for Norway   
    35 Council of Norway's  allocations to ICT was awarded to projects in AI, robotics and  information management (big data). This represents almost NOK 400 million.   Between 2015 and 2019 allocations to these research areas totalled approximately  NOK 1.3 billion, of which almost NOK 400 million was allocated to research  infrastructure while over NOK 240 million was allocated to innovation projects in the  industrial sec tor. AI, robotics and information management are also the ICT technology  areas that grew most between 2015 and 2019 (see Figure 4). Other important ICT related R&D areas are data protection, security and risk.     Figure 4: R&D expenditure for different tech nology areas in the Research Council of Norway.  Recorded expenditure of funds allocated by the Research Council of Norway 2015 –2018 and  budgeted figures for 2019.   Source: Research Council of Norway     The investment in AI is heavily influenced by the challe nges and opportunities that lie  in applications, and projects that combine good AI research with advanced applications  stand a strong chance of winning the competition for funding.   The Research Council of Norway's centre schemes   The centre schemes are intended to support the best research communities and drive  pioneering research and ground -breaking innovation or to strengthen priority areas.  The centres for research -based innovation and the centres of excellence are two  examples of such schemes. The ov erarching objectives of the centres for research based innovation are to enhance innovative ability and increase value creation in the  Norwegian business sector through long -term research.     
    36 Norwegian AI Research Consortium  (NORA)   In 2018 a consortium was set up aimed at strengthening Norwegian research and  education in artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics and related  disciplines. The consortium comprises Norwegian universities and research  institutions engaged in research and education in ar tificial intelligence: the  University of Agder, the Arctic University of Norway, OsloMet, the University of  Bergen, the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Simula Research Laboratory AS,  the University of Stavanger, NORCE and the University of Oslo.   Source : nora.ai     BigInsight – Statistics for the knowledge economy and Sirius – Centre for Scalable Data  Access are centres for research -based innovation that focus on AI -relevant  technologies (big data and data analysis). The Research Council of Norway is now  witnessing a  trend whereby most centres for research -based innovation have one or  more activities related to artificial intelligence. Sirius is affiliated with the BigMed  project, to which the Research Council of Norway has allocated NOK 60 million for  personalised me dicine and use of large -scale data analysis in healthcare.   Industrial PhD scheme   Under the industrial PhD scheme, companies can get  funding from the Research  Council of Norway to allow an employee to undertake a PhD project in an area that is  relevant to the company's activities. The scheme enables companies to enhance their  long -term research competence and innovation ability and to strengthen their  collaborative relationship with academia.   The scheme is a good alternative for companies in need of target ed research activities  but with no possibility or capacity to initiate large -scale R&D projects. Figures from the  Research Council of Norway show that artificial intelligence is the area of knowledge in  ICT showing the strongest growth in the industrial Ph D scheme.   The Government's ambition for Norwegian AI research   The Government considers Norway to be well placed to succeed with human -friendly  and trustworthy AI, and with AI in industrial applications. Norway has a technologically  advanced industry with  the ability and will to adopt new solutions. Although large  countries such as the United States and China have resources with which neither  Norway nor Europe can compete, there are areas where Norway and Europe have  competitive advantages, such as certain  industrial applications of AI and trustworthy AI  that takes data protection and ethical considerations into account.   To ensure that Norway remains internationally competitive in areas where we have  comparative advantages, it is important that AI research  is integrated with investments  in these areas.   As a small country, Norway does not have the capability to build knowledge and  expertise to high international standards across the full spectrum of AI. Nevertheless,  the quality and scope of our national ex pertise must be sufficient to exploit the  technologies and innovations that emerge internationally. Another goal must be to 
    37 leverage our position as a nation with a digitally advanced population and business  sector in order to take the lead in applying AI,  not least in industry.   Our national research and study programmes in artificial intelligence must hold a high  international  standard . Artificial intelligence falls under one of the five long -term  priorities in the Government's long -term plan for research  and higher education:  enabling and industrial technologies. The Government is increasing allocations to this  priority area through, among other things, the Technology Initiative escalation plan,  which is one of the stated measures in the long -term plan.      Private investments in AI research   Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)   Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) is a Swedish  research institution funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. WASP  cooperates with Sweden's five leading ICT universities. WASP focuses on two  areas in AI: the main focus area covers machine learning, deep learning and next generati on AI (explainable AI) and the other focus area is the mathematical  foundations of AI.   WASP also aims to recruit outstanding international researchers and to enhance  competence in Sweden and in Swedish industry by training at least 400 new PhD  candidates,  of which at least 100 should be industrial PhD candidates. WASP has a  budget of SEK 3 billion up to and including 2026.   Norwegian Open AI Lab   The Telenor -NTNU AI Lab was established at the Norwegian University of Science  and Technology (NTNU) in 2017 after Telenor donated approximately NOK 50  million. The donation was made to help boost research, innovation and education  in artificial intelligen ce, machine learning, big data analysis and IoT in Norway. In  2018 several business partners were included in the cooperation project, and the  research centre changed its name to the Norwegian Open AI Lab. The new  partners – DNB, DNV GL, Equinor and Kongsb erg – have donated funds towards  general research at NTNU and to research where AI is a central component. The  contributions from industry are donated primarily to fund researcher positions  and professorships but also physical facilities and equipment that  can be used by  both researchers and students.   These types of donations from industry strengthen relationships between the  partner companies and the university. The connection to industry forms a better  platform for exploiting the opportunities that lie i n artificial intelligence. This form  of cooperation will, among other things, give students and researchers  opportunities to work on authentic problems and datasets from industry,  contributing to innovation and moving the frontier of AI research forward.  Cooperation is continually being expanded to include new cooperation partners  from research and industry.   Sources: www.wasp -sweden.org  and Norwegian Open AI Lab  
    38 It is also important that Norwegian research communities take full advantage of the  opportunities offered by the EU framework programme, and that we leverage the   opportunities that lie in our bilateral research and technology agreements with strong  academic communities in leading research nations wor ldwide. Norway must be a  trustworthy and attractive partner in international cooperation, networks and  consortia dealing with research and education in artificial intelligence.   A key research policy objective is to stimulate private investment in research .25 This  includes stimulating private individuals and organisations to make donations to  research. There are general policy instruments to support this: under the gift  reinforcement programme, donations of at least NOK 3 million made to long -term,  basic res earch can trigger a gift reinforcement from the state worth 25 per cent of the  donated amount. This programme is administered by the Research Council of Norway.  The Norwegian Tax Administration has a scheme under which deductions from taxable  income may be  granted for monetary donations made towards scientific research  conducted by pre -approved organisations.   Participation in EU programmes   Norway has actively participated in the EU's framework programmes for research and  innovation for many decades. The Re search Council of Norway's policy instruments  should be designed in such a way that they stimulate and qualify for participation in  the EU programmes. Artificial intelligence and high -perfor mance computing are areas  where we are dependent on international  cooperation.   AI is included in several calls for proposals in Horizon 2020, and will have an even more  prominent place in the next EU framework programme, Horizon Europe. Investment in  innovation will also be strengthened compared with the current period .   The EU has proposed establishing a comprehensive digitalisation programme, Digital  Europe Programme (DEP), for the period 2021 –2027. This is the first time the EU has  proposed a programme dedicated specifically to digitalisation.   The programme has a pr oposed budget of EUR 9.2 billion divided into five main areas:  high -performance computing, artificial intelligence, cyber security, digital  transformation and inter operability, and advanced digital skills. DEP is a core element  in the European Commission' s efforts in digital transformation . The programme  targets areas where individual countries alone lack the necessary resources to  succeed. The resources in the programme will be used in areas where they are  expected to be most effective, such as health, justice, consumer protection and publi c  administration. The programme also aims to help small and medium -sized enterprises  to adapt to changes brought about by digitalisation and artificial intelligence.   Norway has made a non -binding declaration of intent to participate in the next  programme period for the research and innovation framework programme, Horizon  Europe. This will give us the opportunity to participate in the strategic planning  process. The Government is considering Norway’s possible participation in DEP.                                                    25 Report to the Storting no. 4 (2018 –2019) Long -term Plan for Research and Higher Education  and the  Granavolden platform of 17 January 2019  
    39   Figure 5: Priority areas  in DEP   Source: European Commission 2018     The Government will also facilitate participation by the business sector in the European  Commission's research, innovation and development programmes. This will give  access to leading knowledge communities and mark ets. The Research Council of  Norway and Innovation Norway have policy instruments for providing guidance and  encouraging Norwegian actors to participate in EU programmes.   The Research Council of Norway has taken the initiative to form a national network f or  artificial intelligence. The objective is to promote Norway's priorities and interests in  the strategy work that takes place in the EU and to achieve  greater participation by  Norway in Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe. The network will coordinate input f rom  Norwegian research communities and give strategic advice concerning  the Research  Council of Norway's focus areas. An important task for the network is to organise  meeting places to promote contact, cooperation and knowledge dissemination  between the re search communities and increased involvement by the business and  public sectors. The network was established in the spring of 2019 and brings Norway's  leading AI communities together.   Higher education   The universities and university colleges have a high de gree of autonomy. They are  responsible for following up the national sectoral goals for the university and  university college sector, one of which is to facilitate good access to education. The  institutions have responsibility for designing the study progr ammes. The Government  can use various means to signal which areas it wants the institutions to give priority to;  for example, by allocating resources to study places earmarked for certain subject  areas, such as nursing or cyber security. Since 2015 the Gov ernment has given  particular priority to ICT -related programmes. Increased allocations to these  programmes allow almost 1,600 more students admission to ICT -related studies every  year.   
    40 Subjects that can be classified as artificial intelligence are part of  several study  programmes, but are most  common  in programmes in  information technology and  cybernetics/robotics. In these programmes – at both bachelor and master level –  students may, to varying extents, choose courses in AI or decide to specialise in AI by  both choosing AI -relevant subjects and writing their bachelor or master's thesis in that  subject area. Typical s ubjects in these types of study programmes are: algorithms,  machine learning, computer vision, deep learning and big data analysis.   Some educational institutions also offer dedicated programmes in AI, but up to now  these programmes could offer relatively few study places. Since 2018, however, we see  that a growing number of educational institutions are offering separate programmes  in AI at both bachelor and master level. Institutions already offering such programmes  are expanding the number of study places. More than 350 new study places dedicated  to AI, robotics and data science are planned from 2020, compared to 2017.   More than 400 m aster degree candidates with a clear AI profile are estimated to have  graduated every year from  2016 to 2019. These were candidates from study  programmes dedicated to AI and candidates whose choice of course and thesis define  them as 'AI candidates'.26 The majority of these students graduated from the University  of Oslo and NTNU. In addition, just over 300 bachelor candidates graduate every year  with AI profiles . Some of them pursue master programmes in the same subject area.   Informal learning arenas: Eik idéverksted   Eik idéverksted is a makerspace for technological innovation. The makerspace is a  cooperation project between the Norwegian University of Life Sciences  (NMBU) ,  Inkubator Ås, the Savings Bank Foundation DNB and the SpareBank 1 Foundation.  Eik idéverksted offers a range of courses, workshops, seminars and projects to  students and employees at N MBU . The aim is to serve as an active meeting place  that is open to the academic, student, local and business communities.   Many of the students who partici pate in Eik idéverksted learn to use AI tools at  quite advanced levels, even though they do not necessarily have the same in depth knowledge and academic background as students taking formal courses in  AI. AI is becoming increasingly accessible because com panies like Google and  Facebook offer low -threshold tools in areas such as image processing, natural  language processing, prediction, and so on.   Sources: Norwegian University of Life Sciences  (NMBU), eikide.org                                                    26 Data on, among other things, the number of students and the number of candidates which the  institutions report to the Database for Statistics on Higher Education  are not tagged to such a level  of detail as to enable retrieval of reliable figures on programmes in AI. To gain a picture of the  current situation, the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation therefore asked the  educational institutions to count t he number of candidates who graduated from study  programmes in AI and the number of candidates with an 'AI profile'.   The enquiry regarding the numbers of study places and graduated candidates in AI was sent to all  the universities as well as to Østfold Un iversity College, Western Norway University of Applied  Sciences, Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, and Kristiania University College. All of  them submitted reports. As well as reporting the number of study places and the number of  candidates wh o took examinations at bachelor, master and PhD levels in AI, they also reported on  new study programmes in AI and on increases in the number of study places in existing AI  programmes. The institutions may have used different definitions of what constitute s an 'AI  profile' or an 'AI programme' and thus which candidates were counted.  
    41 Development of study programmes in AI   The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Oslo hosts a  centre of excellence, the Centre for Computing in Science Education (CSSE), which  makes an important contribution to further developing  study programmes in AI.   The faculty, through CCSE and the Centre for Teaching and Learning in Science  and Technology (KURT), offers comprehensive continuing education to  schoolteachers in order to integrate programming into school subjects. This is  done through the ProFag programming course for schoolteachers. What subjects  are taught in schools is a key factor in raising the level of higher education in  artificial intelligence, including machine learning, robotics and data science.   Source: University of  Oslo     The number of PhD degrees in topics that can be defined as artificial intelligence is also  steadily growing. Moreover, methods from artificial intelligence are increasingly used  as tools by PhD candidates and researchers in other areas.   As well as  seeking candidates with specific training in AI and data science, business and  industry is also interested in candidates with sound knowledge in information  technology, mathematics and statistics. Candidates like these will possess the  necessary prerequis ites for understanding and learning more about AI, either through  formal education or through training in the workplace.   Need for interdisciplinarity   Knowledge of artificial intelligence, and related fields such as ethics and data  protection associated wit h AI applications, will be important in study programmes  oriented towards the educational sector, health, crime prevention, law and several  other fields. For example, an introductory course in artificial intelligence has been  established at the University of Bergen, in which students of medicine and  bioengineering learn about how AI can be used in clinical practice. One of the aims is  to promote interdisciplinary cooperation between physicians and engineers. The  universities of Bergen and Oslo also offer co urses in artificial intelligence and machine  learning oriented towards social scientists.   Institutions of higher education ought to evaluate how topics with relevance to artificial  intelligence can be integrated into their programmes in areas that will be affected  by  artificial intelligence in the coming years.   Need for knowledge about study programmes with relevance to artificial intelligence   During the work on preparing this strategy, it has become clear that official statistics  on higher education are not sufficiently detailed to provide reliable information about  the scope of the different study programmes needed to succeed with artificial  intelligence in Norway. This knowledge base must therefore be strengthened. The EU  is also working on models that can produce better knowledge on this issue, based on  official statistics and existing databases. Norway is engaged in this work, and will  evalu ate whether new measurements can be based on these models.     
    42 The Government will      strengthen basic ICT research through the Research Council of Norway    complete implementation of the Technology Initiative escalation plan laid out  in Report to the Storting no. 4 (2018 –2019) Long -term plan for research and  higher education 2019 –2028    consider Norwegian participation in relevant EU programmes in the next  programme period    take an initiative to encourage research cooperation with the private sector,  inspired by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program  (WASP) in Sweden    set clear expectations for educational institutions to design and adapt thei r  study programmes in AI to meet anticipated needs in the labour market and to  integrate AI into established study programmes where relevant    establish a knowledge base that makes it possible to monitor trends in study  places and candidates in AI   
    43 3.2 Skills  The Government wants digital skills and technology literacy to be given more  prominence already at primary and lower secondary school level. Under The  Curriculum Renewal ,27 natural science will be made a more exploratory and practical  subject already at p rimary school level, with a distinct technology element that also  includes programming. Programming will be introduced in more subjects; among  other things, programming and computational thinking skills will be included in the  new mathematics subject.   The new curricula will come into effect in 2020. It will take a long time before the  children starting school in the autumn of 2020 complete their education and are ready  to start work or take further studies, perhaps in technology or artificial intelligence.  In  the meantime there will be a need to manage the new skill requirements expected of  today's adult population in both their private and working lives.   Courses and further education programmes   An analysis from 2015 estimated a high probability that 33 pe r cent of jobs in Norway  would be automated over the next 20 years. These figures have subsequently been  modified, and a 2018 report from the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and  Development (OECD)28 estimated that only 6 per cent of jobs in Norway were at risk of  automation. This figure is the lowest of all OECD member countries. It also emerged  that Norwegian employees – both those with and those without higher education –  were among those who receiv e most training in the workplace.   NAV's Horizon Scan29 deals with the most important societal trends that will affect the  future labour market. It shows that the pace of change in the labour market will  accelerate. OECD estimates that every fourth job will  undergo major changes.  Technological developments will likely lead to many new jobs, but will just as likely lead  to employees having to change jobs, change the formal relationship they have with  employers, and update their skills more often. Opportunitie s for upskilling and  reskilling  – both in the workplace and through study programmes – will therefore  become increasingly important. Development and use of artificial intelligence make up  part of this picture.   Like elsewhere, technological developments in  artificial intelligence are bringing about  changes in many jobs; some work tasks will disappear, while tasks that require other  skill types will emerge. Meanwhile, ever fewer jobs will require little or no formal skills.  The Government considers it import ant that people who already have jobs be given  opportunities to take courses and further education. In 2020 the Government will  present a white paper on a skills reform for lifelong learning ( Lære hele livet ). The  objectives of the skills reform are that n o one should be left behind and that more  employees should remain longer in their jobs.                                                    27 The Curriculum Renewal refers to the work on renewing all the curricula in primary and lower  secondary education and in upper secondary education. The new curricula will come  into effect at  the start of the school year in 2020   28 Nedelkoska, L. and Quintini, G.

    44 AI for everyone: Elements of AI   Elements of AI is a series of free online courses in artificial intelligence. The course  was developed in the spring of 2018 by the Finnish company Reaktor, its  Norwegian sister company Feed and the University of Helsinki. The aim of the  course is to teach as many as possible about what AI is, what it can and cannot be  used for, and how to start using methods based on AI. The course co mbines  theory with practical exercises, and requires no prior knowledge.   Elements of AI has quickly become extremely popular, and ranks top in several  overviews of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Eighteen months after it was  launched, more than 230,00 0 people had registered to take the course, of which  15 to 20 per cent have completed all the modules.   The course has attracted much larger proportions of female students (40  per  cent ) and students aged over 45 (30  per cent ) than is normally the case for ICT  courses. In Sweden and Finland the proportion of female students taking the  course is more than 50 per cent. Since Elements of AI was launched, the  University of Helsinki, which is the host university, has seen increases in the  number of ordinary appli cants to ICT programmes and in the proportion of  female applicants.   A key factor in motivating people to complete the course is the #AIChallenge. The  #AIChallenge encourages companies and public agencies to commit to supporting  their employees to complete  Elements of AI. By the autumn of 2019 more than  450 Finnish and Swedish organisations had taken up the challenge, among them  Telia, Nokia, Systembolaget, Nordea, Bonnier, Swedish Tax Agency and Volvo.   Elements of AI will be launched in Norwegian in coope ration with NTNU  in 2020 .  Source : Feed/Reaktor     Employers must ensure that their employees possess the necessary skills. This  includes assessing the need for continuing and further education. Individual  employees must also take responsibility for their own skills development in a labour  market with ever  increasing requirements. Nonetheless, some skill needs may not be  met, and the public sector ought to find new ways of addressing these.   To help enterprises meet new skill needs that arise, the Government has established a  range of schemes that support t he development and operation of flexible further  education programmes. Several programmes in digital skills have already been  established as a result of cooperation between universities, university colleges or  tertiary vocational colleges and the labour ma rket. The idea is to enable people to  undertake this type of further education while they are employed.   From 2020 the Government will reinforce these efforts through a new Skills  Programme and through increased allocations to a competition -based scheme  adm inistered by the Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation and Quality  Enhancement in Higher Education (Diku). The target group for the programmes  developed with funding from these schemes are employees who need new skills due  to restructuring needs c reated by digitalisation and the transition to a green s ociety .  
    45 Workplace training   Norway has positive experiences with handling  restructuring in the labour market due  to various changes.30 Norwegian employees are good at adapting, and cooperation  between employee organisations, employer organisations and the authorities is good.  This may be one of the reasons why Norwegian employee organisations tend to seek  dialogue on how employees and emp loyers can work together to meet the coming  challenges rather than focus their concerns on the potential negative consequences of  AI for jobs and work tasks.   Several large enterprises have launched their own further education programmes in AI  and data ana lysis. For example, DNB bank has offered its employees opportunities to  train as data scientists in order to meet the bank's need for competence in this area.   The Government is also cooperating with the employee and employer organisations  on  an industry p rogramme for the municipal care sector and an industry programme for  industry and construction. The costs of the industry programmes are shared among  the state, which pays for developing and operating the programmes; the enterprises,  which invest their own  resources; and the employees, who invest some of their free  time. The industry programmes will also be included in the Skills Programme in 2020,  and work on the programmes will be strengthened and further developed in  cooperation between the partners.           Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund: testing AI as a training measure   When the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund (Lånekassen) was introducing a  new collaboration platform in 2017, it wanted to find out whether an AI chatbot  could make training users of the platform more effective. Lånekassen decided to  use a technology s upplied by the Norwegian company Boost.ai, a market leader in  conversational AI. Because testing the chatbot involved all Lånekassen employees,  they all gained insight into what a chatbot is and how it is trained.   After two weeks, Lånekassen's employees h ad performed close to 1,500 chats  with the robot. The system made an important contribution to the launch of the  collaboration platform, as well as illustrating how use of AI created an opportunity  to involve a whole organisation. This measure is an exampl e of successful public – private cooperation on using new technology and modern development  methodology. The test project has also provided experience transfer for other  public agencies such as Vy, NAV and the Norwegian Government Agency for  Financial Manage ment (DFØ).

    46 Student projects as a measure to access new skills and for recruitment   The Norwegian Tax Administration has in recent years hosted summer projects  using AI, such as Pattern Recognition in Cryptocurrency and AI -assisted Tax  Returns. The objective of these projects is to test new technologies. Participants  are recruited from technology study programmes in AI, machine learning,  programming and statistical methods, among others. The projects not only  provide the Norwegian Tax Administration with an op portunity to conduct  interesting pilot projects in relevant areas; they also give the agency the chance to  present itself as a potential workplace for students who will be highly sought -after  in the labour market once they graduate.   Source: Norwegian Tax Administration                       The Government will      make Elements of AI available in Norwegian through the Norwegian University  of Science and Technology, and initiate the #AIChallenge in Norway    consider a digital platform for continuing and further education  programmes     support development of flexible further education programmes so that  universities and university colleges can apply for funding to develop  programmes in AI    prepare a strategy for digital competence in the public sector

The  Government will evaluate how industrial policy instruments can best  be designed to support potential value creation and u se of AI in the  business sector.   Public agencies ought to actively explore the potential of the  technology, and increased interaction between the public sector and  the business sector should promote innovation and value creation.   4 Enhancing innovation  capacity using AI   Norway can take a leading position in applying artificial intelligence, particularly in  areas where we already are well posi tioned  and have strong business and research  communities, such as health, oil and gas, energy, the maritime and marine industries  and the public sector.   The foundation we lay in the form of access to good infrastructure, data sharing,  research and competen ce building will also provide a good starting point for increased  innovation and value creation for small but technologically advanced companies.   The largest public agencies already serve as a driving force in AI by actively exploring  the potential that l ies in this technology. The Government will facilitate s haring of best  practice across sectors and enterprises.   Increased interaction and cooperation between the public and business sectors, and  between research communities and the business sector, are vital to unlocking the  innovative potential of applying artificial intelligence  in the form of both established  and new models of cooperation.  
    48 The public sector ought to actively explore opportunities in the market in connection  with procurements, and inn ovative public procurements should be used wherever  appropriate. To facilitate innovative solutions, agencies ought to focus on the ir needs   rather than on specific products or services.   4.1 Industrial policy instruments   The authorities play an important r ole in facilitating business development, also with  regard to AI. However, the business sector also has a responsibility to develop and  adopt technologies that can create better, more profitable services or more efficient  operations.   The underlying assumption is that companies and enterprises invest less in research  and development than what is profitable for society as a whole. As part of Norway's  research and innovation system, public authorities therefore facilitate innovation  throu gh grants and other schemes administered by the system of policy instruments  for research and innovation. Several policy instruments currently available promote  research in, and development, testing and commercialisation of, artificial intelligence.   Suppo rt for the early phase, where more emphasis is placed on research and research based innovation, is usually provided through the Research Council of Norway .  Innovation Norway  has a responsibility to promote innovation, value creation and  growth in business  and industry through, among other things, financial contributions  and expertise. In recent years Innovation Norway has arranged the Tech City Executive  Accelerator (TEA) initiative for companies oriented towards AI and IoT. The aim is to  make executives i n expanding Norwegian companies aware of the opportunities for  leveraging AI and I oT. TEA is based in London.   The Industrial Development Corporation of Norway (S iva) facilitates innovation through  infrastructure such as business gardens, incubators and in itiatives such as the  Norwegian Catapult scheme. Investinor  is a state -owned venture investment company  whose purpose is to improve access to capital in the early -stage market (the market for  investment capital for companies in the process of developing ne w products or  processes). Export credit and guarantee schemes  help Norwegian businesses enhance  their competitiveness in the international market.     Innovation project: Machine learning in seismology   Earth Science Analytics AS leads an industry innovation project that receives  funding via the Research Council of Norway's PETROMAKS 2 programme Machine  Learning in Geoscience. The project shows how digitalisation and artificial  intelligence are in the pro cess of transforming the seismic industry.   Today geologists spend around 70 per cent of their time on seismic interpretation.  Artificial intelligence could automate some parts of the interpretation process.  This would make retrieving relevant information from seismic data far easier and  more efficient. The technology can also be combined with tools for analysing well  data. This will help the oil companies make better decisions based on large  amounts of reliable data.   Source: Ministry of Petroleum and Energy  
    49 Digital21   Digital21 is a strategy developed by and for businesses. The goal has been to  make recommendations to the authorities on how businesses can better develop  and benefit from competence, technology, research and development in order to  succ eed in digitalisation. An important message in the strategy is that Norway  cannot be best at everything, and should therefore give priority to the technology  areas where Norwegian business and industry can profit most. Digital21  highlights artificial intel ligence, big data, the Internet of Things and autonomous  systems as particularly important technologies for Norway in the time ahead.   Sourc e: digital21.no     Some countries have introduced grant schemes for businesses that start up AI  projects. In Sweden, for example, Vinnova has established a scheme to which  companies and public enterprises can apply for grants of up to SEK 500,000 to start up  their first AI project. Norway has no schemes specifically for R& D in AI; instead we have  a broader scheme, SkatteFUNN , through which Norwegian companies can apply for  tax deductions on R&D costs. SkatteFUNN is a rights -based scheme with simple  application processes and reporting requirements.   Forskerpool  [Researcher Pool] is a scheme affiliated to SkatteFUNN to which businesses  can apply for up to 50 hours of assistance from a researcher to develop an idea or get  feedback on a problem. This scheme may be particularly relevant for SMEs, which  often lack th is type of in -house expertise. In AI, where there is a shortage of personnel  with advanced skills, schemes like these where resources are shared can help more  companies gain access to the expertise they need to start their projects or pilots.   Business clu sters represent a policy instrument that can be suitable for promoting  business development in AI. Innovation Norway, the Research Council of Norway, and  Siva currently fund a cluster programme. The business community takes on the roles  of leading and coor dinating the business clusters, but research institutions and public  agencies are often members.     Cluster for applied AI   In Halden, eSmart Systems, the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), Østfold  University College and the research and innovation company Smart Innovation  Norway have taken the initiative to develop a new cluster, the Cluster for Applied  AI. The ambition is  to create an optimal platform for developing Norwegian  companies' international competitiveness and sustainable social development  through applied AI. The purpose of the cluster is to create new jobs and  sustainable development based on rapid development and application of AI. Key  focus areas will be technological development, commercialisation, ethics, security  and accessibility. The cluster will facilitate the sharing of data, infrastructure and  other technologies that its members would otherwise be unab le to invest in.   Sourc e: Smart Innovation Norway  
    50 DigitalNorway   DigitalNorway is a non -profit organisation whose mission is to make it easier for  Norwegian businesses to succeed with digitalisation. DigitalNorway cooperates  with research and educational institutions, business clusters and several of  Norway's best compe tence and innovation communities. Among other things, the  organisation provides tools for companies that want to make the transition from  idea to product or service, and networks for sharing knowledge and experiences.   The Conversion Engine service helps c ompanies build their in -house expertise in  digitalisation and advanced production. Together with Smart Innovation Norway,  NCE iKuben and NCE Kongsberg Innovasjon, DigitalNorway leads the work on the  Conversion Engine for digitalisation while NCE Raufoss ha s corresponding  responsibility for manufacturing/ advanced production. The aim is to help small  and medium -sized enterprises throughout the country succeed in their digital  transformation. Innovation Norway supports the programme.   Source : DigitalNorway     There are also good examples of the business sector launching its own initiatives.  Measures such as the AI Village in Trondheim, where several companies have joined  forces to leverage synergies and create a stronger community, are good examples of  how coo peration within the business sector can produce positive effects.   Review of the system of policy instruments   In 2018 the Government launched a comprehensive review of the system of business  policy instruments.31 The purpose is for Norway to derive maximum value creation and  economically sustainable jobs within sustainable parameters from the resources that  are channelled through the system of policy instruments.   EU policy instruments for AI targeting SMEs: Digital Innovation Hubs   Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) is a policy instrument that was launched by the  European Commission in 2016 to help small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) to  digitalise faster. The first generation of DIHs was created under Horizon 202 0. Four  Norwegian DIHs  have been set up, affiliated with GCE NODE in Agder, SINTEF, Oslo  Cancer Cluster and Digital Norway, all of which are active enablers for SMEs.   In the transition to the new EU programmes for 2021 –2027, a new generation of larger  and more binding DIHs will be introduced. These will be one -stop shops, and will cover  an ecosystem (national and international) that can offer expertise and competence  and contribute to enabling SMEs in particular to become digital and leverage the  potential  of artificial intelligence. Funding for the projects will come from the Digital  Europe Programme, among others.   The DIH programme and Norway's catapult scheme share some common features.   The Government has established Norwegian Catapult, a scheme that gives Norwegian  industry access to test facilities in order to enhance innovation and value creation.                                                   31 Updated information on the review of the system of business -oriented policy ins truments is  available (in Norwegian) at www.regjeringen.no/vmg  
    51 NOK 125 million was allocated to the scheme in the 2019 national budget. Siva has  given priority to further developing the catapult scheme in 2019, in cooperation with  Innovation Norway and the Research Council of Norway.   In Norway the clusters will be key participants in the DIHs that  are set up. One  important task for the system of policy instruments will be to further develop  complementarity between the hubs, the cluster programme and the catapult scheme.    Intellectual property rights   Protecting intellectual property rights is important for ensuring that the AI market  develops in the right  way. Any uncertainty about ownership of the various elements  that make up solutions based on AI (data, development framework, pre -trained  algorithms, etc.), how they are licensed or how access to the solutions is paid for, will  have negative impacts.   The Government wants Norwegian companies to make informed and competent  decisions regarding protection, use and enforcement of their intellectual assets and  rights, and to have a professional and conscious approach to the way they handle the  rights of others.  Norwegian companies should secure the increased market access and  value creation which professional protection and use of copyright law can afford them.  Protecting their ownership rights can be particularly decisive in connection with  internationalisation .   The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries has begun mapping competence levels  and needs in the area of intellectual property rights in Norwegian industry, and will  assess whether the guidance offered on the system of policy instruments is adequate.   Public agencies can find it particularly difficult to know how to deal with rights when  development of an AI -based solution is conducted through cooperation between the  public sector and a private company: for example, how should a public agency handle  ownership and user rights in a partnership where a commercial party develops and  trains algorithms using the public agency's data? This type of issue will likely arise in  the future, and perhaps especially so in connection with using health data for  commerci al purposes.   One important exception here, of course, is open data, which may freely be used by  both commercial and public actors, pursuant to the Norwegian Licence for Open  Government Data (NLOD) or under a Creative Commons licence.         Google DeepMind and the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK   In the UK the National Health Service (Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Trust) has  cooperated with Google DeepMind on developing an algorithm that can identify  eye diseases based on images of the eye. The agreeme nt makes DeepMind the  owner of the final system but entitles Moorfields to the right to use it free of  charge for a given number of years after it is approved for clinical use.   Source: Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Trust  
    52 Standardisation   Norway can contribute to ensuring that artificial intelligence develops in the desired  direction by exerting influence on international standards related to AI. Such influence  is exerted by participating in international standardisation activities and by c hairing  working groups in areas that are important for us. At global level, AI activities are  conducted in the standardisation organisations ISO and EIC and at European level in  CEN and CENELEC. It is most often the large companies that take an active part  in  standardisation activities. The threshold for participating in this type of activity can be  high for many SMEs for various reasons, such as travel costs or the time involved.   Standard Norway has created a mirror committee (SN/K 586 Kunstig Intelligens)  to  follow up international standardisation activities in AI. The committee is composed of  representatives from research, business and industry, national authorities and various  interest organisations.                 The Government will      work towards enabling the D igital Innovation Hubs to help SMEs get started on  applying AI    engage in dialogue with Digital Norway on how it can enable SMEs to take  more advantage of the potential of AI    promote the work on international standardisation activities related to AI,  particularly with regard to stimulating SMEs to participate in these activities    develop guidelines, including proposals for standard agreement clauses, on  how public agencies should deal with ownership rights when cooperating with  the business sector on de veloping artificial intelligence   
    53 4.2 AI-based innovation in the public sector   The Government believes there is vast potential for the public sector to rationalise and  create better services through digitalisation. Artificial intelligence is one aspect of this.  In the future the public sector will use artificial intelligence to deliver more targeted  and user -adapted services, enhance the social benefit of its own activities, rationalise  operations and work processes, and reduce risk.   Artificial intelligenc e in the public sector can contribute to:    more relevant advice and services to citizens in different situations  in life    better decision -making support for public -sector employees    rationalising processes and optimising resource utilisation    improving the qu ality of processes and services by automatically detecting  possible deviations    predicting trends based on data from both agencies and their  environments    natural language processing for sorting and categorising, and for  translating between different langua ges and language forms     Use of AI in the public sector is still in an early phase, however. A survey32 shows that  many agencies are still in the planning or testing phase, where they try to find out what  AI can be used for. Some agencies have begun testing through proofs of concepts. The  survey shows that more than half of the agencies regards organisational culture, legal  and regulatory issues, and data protection and security as the major challenges with  respect to AI. Lack of competence is highlighted as another challenge.   For example, agencies can find it difficult to assess which areas are suitable for AI. One  area that raises several dilemmas is the use of AI for control purposes. Such controls  can involve, for example, identifying individuals who may b e violating regulations (that  is to say where an algorithm identifies a high probability  for this ). For applications like  these, consideration must be given to rule of law and protection against  self-incrimi nation for individuals subjected to regulatory c hecks. The risk and consequences of  false positives – i.e., of someone being wrongly identified and of the undue hardship  this would impose on them – must be part of a data protection impact assessment,  which must be included when a solution is under evalu ation.   Such assessments related to the use of AI in public administration can prove  challenging, particularly if the agency lacks the relevant in -house expertise. Uncertainty  over regulations for processing personal data, relevance to the Public Administr ation  Act or assessments of when it is acceptable to use A I may make agencies unduly  reticent. This may deprive the public sector of important opportunities to improve its  services or rationalise its processes. The Government will therefore ask the Norwegi an  Digitalisation Agency to prepare guidance on this matter, in cooperation with the  Norwegian Data Protection Authority.                                                    32 Broomfield, Heather and Reutter, Lisa (2019): Kunstig intelligens/data science: En kartlegging av  status, utfordringer og behov i norsk offentlig  sektor Første resultater. [Artifical intelligence/data  science: A mapping of status, challenges and needs in Norway's public sector. Initial results].  September 2019  
    54 Projects using AI in public administration   The Government wants public sector organisations  to facilitate experimenting with  artificial intelligence to gain knowledge about and experience in the technology. Trial  projects or pilots in AI will provide valuable experience that can be used when  evaluating large -scale projects and can enhance unders tanding of the technology at all  levels in the organisation.   Artificial intelligence is one of many important tools for developing sustainable public  administration in both central government and the municipal sector. Cooperation and  exchange of best prac tice across organisations  will contribute to better  insights into AI,  and experiences gained by the large agencies, which often have their own IT and  analysis units, can help smaller organisations  get started on AI projects.   The municipal sector is in a unique position when it comes to potential cooperation,  because all municipalities have an obligation to provide the same services to their  inhabitants , which means they  hold datasets covering the same areas. The possibility  to share best practice and to cooperate on procurements and training measures may  therefore be particularly important for the municipalities. Cooperation on data,  algorithms and competence in AI may also  create possibilities to see interrelationships  across sectors.   Examples of projects using AI in the public sector   Several public agencies have conducted projects in which they have used artificial  intelligence:   Artificial intelligence in residence verification   The Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund (Lånekassen) has conducted a  project using artificial intelligence to select students for residence verification. In  2018 Lånekassen’s residential verification process covered 25,000 students, of  which  15,000 were selected using artificial intelligence (machine learning) and  10,000 were selected randomly (control group). The results showed that the  selection made using machine learning was twice as effective at identifying  students who had not documente d previously submitted residence information  compared to the control group.   Automatic posting of invoices   Customers of The Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Management  (DFØ) spend considerable time and resources on posting incoming invoices due to   uncertainty about the correct posting. In some cases this can lead to invoices  being paid after the due date and can create extra costs for the agency in the  form of interest and charges. DFØ is currently testing solutions from two  companies, one of which  involves an accounting robot that uses AI to propose the  correct posting. The model is trained using historical data before making a  prediction of the posting based on a combination of historical data and  information obtained from the actual invoice.   Sources: Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund and Norwegian Government Agency for  Financial Management  
    The Government will      develop guidance on responsible use of artificial intelligence in public  administration    facilitate cooperation and exchange of experience and best practice for AI in  both central and municipal administration    establish a new programme for interaction between startups and the public  sector    present a white paper on innovation in the public sec tor              The Government will therefore ask the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency to facilitate  cooperation in AI for example by establishing common use cases/user  journeys and  sharing of best practice.   Public -private partnerships   Norway's public sector procures goods and services worth more than NOK 500 billion  annually. These procurements can be used to promote innovation and use of new  technologies. A study condu cted by Menon33 shows that most public procurement  processes are conducted without any market dialogue and without encouraging  suppliers to supply systems that are radically new and innovative. The companies  report that young, innovative companies in partic ular find it difficult to know what they  need to do to win contracts.   An innovation partnership is a procurement procedure that facilitates product and  service development through cooperation between buyers and developers/suppliers.  Innovation partnerships  are used for procuring solutions that are not currently  available in the market. Preliminary experiences show that startups and technology  companies win assignments in innovation partnerships more easily than in other  public tendering processes.   One of t he measures in the Government's digital strategy34 is to establish a  programme for increased interaction between the public sector and start -up  companies, modelled on similar programmes in the United States and the United  Kingdom. Such a programme would als o benefit companies whose activities are based  on artificial intelligence.                                                    33 Menon Economics (2017): Midtveisevaluering av nasjonalt program for leverandørutvikling  [Midway  evaluation of the National Programme for Supplier Development]   34 Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation (2017): One digital public sector.

In Norway,  artificial intelligence will be based on ethical principles, respect for  privacy and data protection, and good cyber security.   5 Trustworthy AI     Norway is known for the high level of trust citizens  have in each other and in public  and private institutions. The Government wants to maintain and strengthen this trust  at the same time as artificial intelligence is adopted in new and innovative ways.   The Government believes that:    artificial intelligenc e that is developed and used in Norway should be built  on ethical principles and respect human rights and democracy    research, development and use of artificial intelligence in Norway should  promote responsible and trustworthy AI    development and use of AI in Norway should safeguard the integrity and  privacy of the individual    cyber security should be built into the development, operation and  administration of AI solutions    supervisory authorities should oversee that AI systems in their areas of  supervision ar e operated in accordance with the principles for responsible  and trustworthy use of AI  
    57 5.1 Issues related to artificial intelligence   Developing and using artificial intelligence can create challenges and raise many  complex questions. This particularly applies to AI that builds on personal data.   Big data versus data minimisation   A certain amount of data is needed to develop and use arti ficial intelligence. At the  same time, one of the key principles of data protection is data minimisation, which  requires the amount of personal data collected to be limited to what is necessary for  fulfilling the purpose for collecting it. Consequently, th e need for large datasets can  conflict with the principle of data minimisation. Although enterprises planning to  implement a project based on AI will want to obtain as much data as possible, the  starting point must be to select a relevant sample and a data set that is sufficiently  large.   Enterprises can also consider whether there are other more privacy -friendly methods  of gaining access to the personal data needed, such as anonymised data, synthetic  datasets or various encryption methods.  The Norwegian Dat a Protection Authority has  published a guide on artificial intelligence and privacy which covers this and other  issues.35  Data quality   It is not only the amount of data that is important for artificial intelligence; the quality  and structure of the data mus t also be good. Any errors in the data can have an impact  on the analyses performed. Moreover, there must be metadata describing the content  of the different data fields. A good start is for individual organisations to put their own  house in order36, meanin g that they gain an overview of what data they manage, what  the data means, what it is used for, what processes it is used in, and whether legal  authority exists for sharing it.   One challenge to quality that particularly applies to artificial intelligence  is what is  known as bias. Bias occurs if we have datasets which only contain information about  part of the relevant source data. If an algorithm that is meant to recognize images of  dogs is only trained using images of dogs playing with balls, the algorit hm may reason  that it cannot be a picture of a dog if no ball appears in the image. Similarly, it is  problematic if an algorithm meant for facial recognition is trained on images of faces  from a single ethnic group.   Bias can occur for other reasons; for e xample, a training dataset for supervised  learning may contain bias resulting from human misjudgements or historical bias in  the source data (on account of, for example, the conventional view of men as holders  of certain types of positions, or if the data contains more images of women than men  by a kitchen sink). Artificial intelligence can also be influenced by who defines the  problems.                                                    35 Norwegian Data Protection Authority (2018): Artificial intelligence and privacy.  www.datatilsynet.no/en/regulations -and-tools/reports -on-specific -subjects/ai -and-privacy/   36 Difi (2018): Veileder for orden i eget hus [Guide to putting one's own house in order].  
    58 Lack of transparency   One challenge with artificial intelligence is the lack of transparency in some solutions  based on d eep learning. Some deep learning algorithms can be likened to a 'black box',  where one has no access to the model that can explain why a given input value  produces a given outcome. Most systems based on AI are not black boxes, however,  and render it possib le to understand and document how decisions are made. In areas  where explainability is important, an alternative approach to deep learning might be  more appropriate.   At the same time, much research is being conducted in the field of 'explainable AI',  whic h aims to make black box algorithms explainable. This is not the same as  publishing the code behind an algorithm or allowing full access to full datasets,  because such an approach may breach intellectual property rights and data protection  laws. Instead, e xplainable AI can analyse what data had significance for the outcome  and what significance the different elements had, and thereby explain the logic behind  the outcome.   Autonomy   Finally, the fact that artificial intelligence is characterised by autonomy, a nd that it can  make decisions and initiate actions without human interaction , presents a challenge.  Although the degree of autonomy will vary, it nonetheless raises questions about  responsibility for the consequences of such decisions and how such autonomy  can be  limited. The initial discussions on ethics for artificial intelligence originated in issues  of  autonomy .37   5.2 Ethical principles for artificial intelligence   In its Global Risk Report 2017, the World Economic Forum characterises artificial  intelligence as one of the emerging technologies with the greatest potential benefits  but also the greatest risks. There is therefore a need to continuously discuss what is  responsible and desirable development and what we can do to prevent undesirable  development  in this area .   The European Commission set up an expert group which has drawn up ethical  guidelines for trustworthy use of artificial intelligence.38 The guidelines are based on  the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and on international human  rights law.  The purpose of the guidelines is to promote responsible and sustainable development  and use of artificial intelligence in Europe.   For development and use of AI to be defined as trustworthy, the European  Commission's high -level expert group be lieves that it must be lawful , ethical  and robust .  On this basis, the expert group has proposed seven principles for ethical and  responsible development of artificial intelligence. The Government will adopt these  principles as its basis for responsible dev elopment and use of artificial intelligence in  Norway.                                                    37 See for example Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics. Asimov, Isaac (1950): 'Runaround'.  I, Robot   (The Isaac Asimov Collection edition.). New York City: Doubleday   38 Independent High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission  (2019): Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI  
    59 The principles largely address artificial intelligence that builds on data from or that  affects humans, but they are also relevant for industrial use of AI built on data that  does not constitute personal data.   Satisfying all seven principles simultaneously can prove challenging. Tensions may  arise that create a need to make trade -offs. Such trade -offs should be addressed in a  rational and methodological manner. Where no ethically acceptable trade -offs can be  identified, the development and use of the AI solution should not proceed in its  current form.   All decisions made regarding trade -offs must be reasoned and documented. If unjust  adverse impacts occur in a solution built on AI, mechanisms shoul d be in place to  ensure that such impacts can be reported. Particular attention should be paid to  vulnerable persons or groups, such as children.   1) AI-based solutions must respect human autonomy and control   The development and use of artificial intelligenc e must foster a democratic and fair  society by strengthening and promoting the fundamental freedoms and rights of the  individual. Individuals must have the right not to be subject to automated processing  when the decision made by the system significantly a ffects them. Individuals must be  included in decision -making processes to assure quality and give feedback at all stages  in the process ('human -in-the-loop ').   2) AI-based systems must be safe and technically robust   AI must be built on technically robust sys tems that prevent harm and ensure that the  systems behave as intended. The risk of unintentional and unexpected harm must be  minimised. Technical robustness is also important for a system's accuracy, reliability  and reproducibility.   3) AI must take privacy a nd data protection into account   Artificial intelligence built on personal data or on data that affects humans must  respect the data protection regulations and the data protection principles in the  General Data Protection Regulation.   4) AI-based systems must  be transparent   Decisions made by systems built on artificial intelligence must be traceable,  explainable and transparent. This means that individuals or legal persons must have  an opportunity to gain insight into how a decision that affects them was made .  Traceability facilitates auditability as well as explainability. Transparency is achieved by,  among other things, informing the data subject of the processing. Transparency is also  about computer systems not pretending to be human beings; human beings mu st  have the right to know if they are interacting with an AI system.   5) AI systems must facilitate inclusion, diversity and equal treatment   When developing and using AI, it is especially important to ensure that AI contribute to  inclusion and equality, and t hat discrimination be avoided. Datasets that are used to  train AI systems can contain historical bias, be incomplete or incorrect. Identifiable and  discriminatory bias should, if possible, be removed in the collection phase. Bias can be  counteracted by put ting in place oversight processes to analyse and correct the  system’s decisions in light of the purpose.  
    60 6) AI must benefit society and the environment   Artificial intelligence must be developed with consideration for society and the  environment, and must hav e no adverse effects on institutions, democracy or society  at large.   7) Accountability   The requirement of accountability complements the other requirements, and entails  the introduction of mechanisms to ensure accountability for solutions built on AI and  for their outcomes, both before and after the solutions are implemented. All AI  systems must be auditable.   The Government wants public debate on the ethical use of artificial intelligence and on  what applications of artificial intelligence we want to adopt in Norway. Norway has a  number of bodies whose mandate is to invite public debate on t echnology and ethics,  such as the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, the Norwegian Board of Technology,  and the Norwegian National Committees for Research Ethics.   Privacy by design and ethics   Algorithms can be controlled by facilitating access or audit,  but it is more appropriate  for developers as well as users to build privacy and ethical considerations into systems  from the outset. Such a mindset has already been established with regard to privacy.  Privacy by design is a key requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation, and  means that consideration must be given to privacy in all phases of development of a  system or solution. This is so as to ensure that information systems meet the  requirements of the Personal Data Act and safeguard the rights  of the individual.   Likewise, ethical considerations should be built into algorithms during development.  Among other things, it will be important to assess whether an algorithm may lead to  discrimination and whether it is sufficiently robust to withstand manipulation. Ethical  evaluations may also call for considering potential environmental impacts and whether  a system contributes to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.   Work on privacy by design and ethics require those who work on solutions bas ed on AI  to possess or acquire the necessary competence. Higher education institutions ought  to evaluate how privacy and ethics can be integrated into their programmes in, for  example, information technology and data science.   Artificial intelligence and r esearch ethics   The act relating to the organisation of work on ethics and integrity in research ( Lov om  organisering av forskningsetisk arbeid ) imposes a duty of care on researchers and  research institutions to ensure that all research be conducted in acco rdance with  recognised standards for research ethics. Research institutions have a responsibility to  ensure that candidates and employees receive training in recognised standards for  research ethics and that everyone conducting or participating in research  be familiar  with them. The National Committee for Research Ethics in Science and Technology  recently submitted a report on research ethics in which it proposes nine principles for  AI research in three areas:39                                                   39 Den nasjonale forskningsetiske komité for naturvitenskap og teknologi (2019): Forskningsetisk  betenkning om kun stig intelligens  
    61 A) Responsibility for development and use of auto nomous systems :  Research in AI must safeguard human dignity, assign responsibility, be  explainable, and promote informed public debate.   B) Social implications and responsible research:   Research in AI must acknowledge uncertainties and ensure broad  involvement.   C) Big data :  Research in AI must protect privacy and the interests of individuals,  ensure reproducibility and quality, and promote equal access to data.   Challenges for consumers   Use of AI offers many advantages to consumers, such as the development of an ever  increasing range of new services that simplify everyday life. But it also presents  challenges with respect to privacy, transparency and consumer rights. Consumers are  particularl y vulnerable when AI is used to develop personalised services and targeted  marketing based on collecting and processing consumers' personal data. There is  growing concern internationally that businesses are failing to take consumers' privacy  seriously enou gh.   A survey from Consumers International40 shows that consumers appreciate what AI  technology can do; it gives them independence, entertainment and motivation in new  and interesting ways. But the survey also shows that consumers are unsure about how  their  personal data is used and who is behind the data processing. They seek more  clarity and control.   When services and marketing are made increasingly personalised, consumers risk  being subjected to discriminatory treatment and arbitrary non -transparent deci sions  such as price discrimination. Moreover, personalised marketing and other commercial  practices developed using AI can manipulate and mislead consumers into making  decisions that are not in their interests.   AI affects many aspects of consumer's social  life and will encompass different sectors  of society. The use of AI raises legal issues under various sectoral legislation,  particularly in competition, privacy and data protection, and consumer protection. It is  therefore important that the relevant supe rvisory authorities cooperate on this issue.  They should develop competence and information, and participate in international  forums such as the Digital Clearinghouse, the European forum for consumer,  competition and data protection enforcement bodies. In the white paper on the  consumer of the future ,41 the Government announced that it will create a similar  cooperation forum at national level: Digital Clearinghouse Norway.   Regulation of artificial intelligence in the consumer sector   Norway has a tradition o f strong consumer protection laws. Efforts are being made in  Norway and the EU to provide consumers with strong and enforceable rights that are  adapted to digital life. As part of these efforts, the EU has adopted a number of  regulatory acts that will stre ngthen consumer rights online, such as the proposed  package of measures called the New Deal for Consumers. While these regulatory acts                                                   40 Consumer International (2019): Artificial intelligence: Consumer experiences in new Technology   41 Meld. St. 25 (2018 -2019) Framtidas forbrukar – grøn, smart og digital . [Report to the Storting no. 25  (2018 -2019 Consumer of the future – green, smart and digital]  
    62 do not specifically address AI, the European Commission has stressed that AI will be  one of the key areas in the time ahe ad.42 Norwegian authorities have been closely  monitoring the EU's work on modernisation of consumer rights and will continue to do  so.   International cooperation on ethical and trustworthy AI   Norway is engaged in an array of international forums that work o n strategies and  guidelines for ethical and trustworthy artificial intelligence, among them the UN, EU,  OECD and the Nordic Council of Ministers.   United Nations   Norway participates in processes, activities and discussions across the UN system  dealing with  applications of AI. Thematic areas in which AI is given attention span from  eliminating hunger, combating climate change and efforts to promote good health for  all to discussing disarmament and international security.43   European Union   Norway, represented by the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation, has  participated in EU activities related to AI  from the start, and was involved in, among  other things, preparing the  European Commission's Coordinated Pl an on Artificial  Intelligence from December 2018 .44 The EU is working towards human -centric and  trusted AI. Norway participates in this work and sits on the steering group that is  developing a coordinated approach to AI together with the European Commission  and  the member states .   The European Commission is expected to submit a legislative proposal on AI regulation  in 2020. A new regulatory framework for AI is expected to build on the ethical  principles for developing and using AI published by the EU's high -level expert group in  April 2019, on which the Government has based its ethical principles for AI. Norway will  be actively involved in the work carried out on any future regulatory framework for AI.   OECD   The Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Deve lopment (OECD) is working on AI  and has published  several reports on the topic . Norway, represented by the Ministry of  Local Government and Modernisation, has participated in OE CD's work on preparing a  recommendation on artificial intelligence .45 This was finally approved on 22 May 2019.   The recommendation identifies key values for trustworthy AI, namely: inclusive growth,  sustainable development and well -being; human -centred values and fairness ;  transparency and explainability; robustness, security and safety; an d accountability. In  addition, OECD makes recommendations pertaining to R&D in AI, fostering a digital  ecosystem for AI and shaping public policy on AI. The importance of building human  capacity and preparing for labour market transformation is also highli ghted.                                                   42 European Commission (2018) Communication from the commission to the European Parliament, the  Council and the European Economic and Social Committee – A new deal for consumers   43 In 2018 the International Telecommunication Union (IT U) published a summary of UN activities on  AI: handle.itu.int/11.1002/pub/8120d5d5 -en    44 European Commission (2018): Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2018) 795 final)   45 OECD (2 019): Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence, OECD/LEGAL/0449   
    63 Furthermore, the OECD points out the importance of international cooperation for  ensuring ethical and trustworthy AI.   Council of Europe   The Council of Europe is concerned with the potential impacts of AI on human rights.  The European Court of Human  Rights (ECHR) has as of 2019 not yet heard any cases in  which artificial intelligence has been the central issue, though it has touched on the  topic in some contexts. In the autumn of 2019 the Council of Europe set up an ad -hoc  committee to examine the op portunities and risks posed by AI in respect of human  rights. Norway, represented by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, participates  in this work.   Nordic Council of Ministers and Nordic –Baltic cooperation   Nordic cooperation on digitalisation wil l promote the Nordic and Baltic countries as a  cohesive and integrated digital region. Through binding cooperation and projects, the  Nordic countries will find solutions to problems encountered by citizens and  businesses, promote innovative technologies an d services, and make it easier to  develop new services for individuals and businesses throughout the region. Nordic – Baltic agreements have been signed on closer cooperation on 5G, AI and data sharing .           The Government will      encourage development and use of artificial intelligence in Norway to be  based on ethical principles and to respect human rights and democracy    encourage industry and interest organisations to establish their own industry  standards or labelling or certification schemes based on the principles for  responsible use of artificial intelligence    encourage the educational institutions to consider how privacy and ethics can  be given a central place in their programmes in artificial intelligence    expect the supervisory authorities to have the  competence and authority to  supervise artificial intelligence systems within their areas of supervision in  order to, among other things, ensure compliance with the principles for  responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence    establish a cooperation forum for consumer, competition and data protection  enforcement bodies: Digital Clearinghouse Norway    continue to participate in European and international forums, including the  EU's work towards creating a regulatory framework to promote responsible  and tr ustworthy use of artificial intelligence and towards modernising  consumer rights in light of digital developments    stimulate public debate on the ethical use of artificial intelligence   
    64 5.3 Security   To ensure a well -functioning digital society, we must min imise the risk of being  affected by adverse cyber incidents. The Government therefore considers cyber  security to be a priority area.   In January 2019 the Government presented a national strategy for cyber security46 and  a national strategy for cyber securi ty competence.47 The cyber security strategy defines  goals for five priority areas:    Norwegian companies shall digitalise in a secure and trustworthy manner,  and improve their capability to protect themselves against cyber incidents.    Critical societal funct ions shall be supported by robust and reliable digital  infrastructure.    Enhanced cyber security competence shall be aligned with the needs of  society.    Norwegian society shall improve its capability to detect and manage cyber  attacks.    The police shall enh ance its capability to combat cyber crime.     The Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the Ministry of Defence have  overarching responsibility for following up the National Cyber Security Strategy for  Norway. The individual ministries are responsible  for ensuring that the strategy’s  priorities and measures are followed up in their respective sectors.   Cyber security and artificial intelligence have two aspects: security in solutions based  on artificial intelligence, and solutions based on artificial in telligence for enhanced  cyber security. The competence needs in these areas will largely overlap. There is also  a need for in -depth specialisation in security architecture for protecting AI systems,  and for specialisation in algorithms/big data for using A I to protect IT systems and  society.   Security in AI-based systems   Implementing an AI system entails applying  conventional technologies such as sensors,  communication networks, data centres, big data and software. An AI system will inherit  vulnerabilities from these technologies and will also introduce new vulnerabilities  as  part of the new AI -based solution. In this respect, AI systems are no different from  conventional IT or from conventional methods of working on cyber security.   As with other IT systems, a structured, holistic approach to cyber security is needed  before an AI system is deployed. The Norwegian National Security Authority's basic  principles for cyber security provide all Norwegian organisations with a good starting  point for identifying what they should consider in their security activities, regardless of  size, maturity and competence.                                                      46 Ministries (2019): National Cyber Security Strategy   47 Ministry of Justice and Public Security (2019): National Strategy for Cyber Security Competence   
    65 Artificial intelligence in law enforcement   The Norwegian Police University College and NTNU in Gjøvik are cooperating on a  project that examines the use of different forms of artificial intelligence for  analysing big data, aimed at detecting, preventing a nd investigating economic  crime. The objective of the Ars Forensica project is to produce new knowledge  that can improve prevention, investigation and prosecution of incidents without  compromising privacy and the rule of law. Some examples of the research  challenges are:   i) vast amounts of electronic data that need to be analysed   ii) fragments of evidence that are hidden in chaotic environments   iii) varying quality in digital trails, and possibilities to plant/distort  digital trails   iv) dynamic environments and continuall y changing  situations/contexts   v) lack of knowledge, and   vi) decisions characterised by uncertainty and conjecture     The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway's IKTPLUSS programme.   Sources : NTNU/Ars Forensica     For many organisations, AI as a service will be provided by external parties with the  necessary competence and computing power. This can create challenges in terms of  transparency, integrity, accountability and traceability. This must be taken into account   when procuring the service. Both the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency and the  Norwegian National Security Authority have issued guidance material on security in  connection with outsourcing and procuring cloud services.   An AI -based IT system must be trustwo rthy as well as robust, secure, safe and  accurate. Depending on the system's purpose, error or manipulation can in some  cases have significantly more far -reaching consequences for an AI system than for a  conventional IT system. This must be taken into acco unt when performing a risk  assessment of such systems.     Protection of digital infrastructure   The existing early warning system for digital infrastructure has been used to  detect targeted cyber attacks for almost 20 years. The Norwegian National  Security Authority is now developing new sensor technology that will build on and  eventually replace the  sensors used in the existing early warning system . A new  platform will be developed to use artificial intelligence and machine learning on  the data collected. The platform will enable automatic analysis of any malware  detected as well as automatic sharing  of results.   Source: Norwegian National Security Authority  
    66 Use of AI for enhanced cyber security   Systems built on artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly widespread, and will  be one of the prerequisites for the success of Norway's future digitalisation efforts.  This also applies to organisations engaged in security activities and in cyber se curity in  particular.   Most security organisations regard the use of AI systems as necessary for identifying  threats and threat agents, and for being able to withstand and manage cyber attacks.  AI-based cyber security solutions contribute to faster detecti on and management of  incidents and to more precise and detailed analysis.   Machine learning and data -driven technology can also help prevent vulnerabilities in  software development. Simula researches technologies aimed at helping software  developers predic t vulnerability in source code during development and thereby  prevent security holes which subsequently could be exploited by threat agents.                 The Government will       develop Norway's capacity to detect and respond to cyber attacks using AI    develop the Norwegian National Security Authority as a tool for guidance,  problem solving and cooperation, with the aim of building its expertise in  securing AI systems and in using AI for enhanced cyber security
