 Artificial intelligence
AI holds the potential to address complex challenges from enhancing education and improving health care, to driving scientific innovation and climate action. However, AI systems also pose risks to privacy, safety, security, and human autonomy. Effective governance is essential to ensure AI development and deployment are safe, secure and trustworthy, with policies and regulation that foster innovation and competition.

Global AI technology calls for interoperable AI policy 







For governments to work together to manage AI on an international level, they need to use common terms and definitions to act as a foundation for cooperation. Doing so allows for interoperability across jurisdictions, even with varying approaches to managing the technology.
The OECD definition of AI systems was revised in 2023 to align with the technology’s latest evolutions and act as a foundation upon which governments can legislate and regulate AI.
The OECD AI Principles guide AI actors in their efforts to develop trustworthy AI and provide policymakers with recommendations for effective AI policies and were revised in 2024 to stay abreast of rapid technological developments.

Shaping an enabling policy environment for responsible AI 







While AI provides tremendous benefits, it can also fuel bias and discrimination and present risks to privacy, safety, security and human autonomy. To develop safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems, there is a need to assess these impacts and manage risks.
The OECD informs policymakers and AI actors by providing tools and live data via its OECD.AI Policy Observatory and for example through the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct.

AI can boost productivity, under favourable conditions 







Initial evidence on AI’s potential for boosting productivity and growth suggests that using recent generative AI tools in the workplace can significantly improve performance in specific tasks (by about 20 to 40 percent, depending on the context). AI can also transform the way governments design and deliver public services to meet evolving societal needs. But the economy-wide, long-term effects are uncertain. 
Macroeconomic gains from AI depend on widespread adoption of the technology and its fast-evolving capabilities. Threats to market competition, inclusion and broader societal risks can also curtail the potential gains.

AI is likely to significantly impact jobs







As OECD countries prepare for an AI revolution, underscored by rapid advancements in generative AI and an increased availability of AI-skilled workers, the landscape of employment is poised for significant change.
To navigate this shift, it's critical to prioritise training and education to equip both current and future workers with the necessary skills, and to support displaced workers with adequate social protection. Additionally, safeguarding workers' rights in the face of AI integration and ensuring inclusive labour markets become paramount. Social dialogue will also be key to success in this new era.
Together, these actions will ensure that the AI revolution benefits all, transforming potential risks into opportunities for growth and innovation.

AI is reshaping education and skills 







AI has the potential to personalise education, providing immediate feedback that helps students learn better, teachers teach better, and schools become more effective. AI can also help students to reason critically, providing explanations or evaluating contrasting arguments. But to offer improved educational outcomes, career opportunities and enhanced civic engagement for all, countries must address digital divides and prevent AI from amplifying bias or eroding data protection.  
As AI outcompetes humans in a growing range of skill areas, the OECD is developing a detailed and authoritative methodology for evaluating AI and robotics capabilities relative to humans, to guide policymakers as they adapt education and training.  As the world – and learning – become ever more digital, we’ll offer policymakers a set of opportunities, guidelines and guardrails about the effective and equitable use of AI in education.

AI holds promise for healthcare and research







The use of AI in research and healthcare offers significant opportunities to enhance patient outcomes, empower people with their health data, and streamline care processes. AI's ability to analyse large datasets can lead to more accurate diagnoses, personalised treatment plans, and predictive health insights. However, this integration is not without risks. Privacy concerns, potential data quality issues in AI algorithms, and the need for robust digital infrastructures are pressing issues that policymakers must address.
To fully leverage AI's potential, co-ordinated policy efforts are essential to develop comprehensive regulations, protect patient data, and ensure equitable access to AI-driven healthcare innovations. A new OECD expert group on AI in health will address the advancement of AI in health in close co-operation with other international organisations such as the World Health Organization.  



















        Context
        
    








        Investment trends reflect global interest in AI technologies
        
    




US venture capital (VC) investors were the most active investors in AI firms, representing 43% of the worldwide value of VC investments in AI in 2020, followed by Chinese investors (20%) and then EU27 investors (9%). 
Investment trends can reflect the investors’ assessment of the potential of AI technologies, and it can set the course for AI innovation and growth.



























        AI research publications can serve as proxy for a country's AI development
        
    




Looking at research publications per country over time is a good indicator for the expansion of AI R&D funding, which leads to innovation. Research publications include articles, books, book chapters and dissertations. 
China represents 22% of global AI publications while the EU stands at 14%, followed by the U.S. at 11%. AI publications in China have increased since 2016, coinciding with its New Generation AI Development Plan in 2017. 



























        AI incidents increased dramatically with generative AI
        
    




In 2023, the OECD launched its AI Incident Monitor (AIM) to follow AI incidents reported in reputable international media. AIM uses machine learning models identifies and classifies incidents. The analysis is done based on the title, abstract and first few paragraphs of each news article.
Between 2022 and 2023, the number of AI incidents reported increased by approximately 1278%, coinciding with the mainstreaming of generative AI.



























        AI likely to significantly impact jobs
        
    




While firms’ adoption of AI is still relatively low, rapid progress including with generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT), falling costs and the increasing availability of workers with AI skills suggest that OECD countries may be on the brink of an AI revolution. Initial findings from a new OECD survey of AI's impact in the manufacturing and finance sectors of seven countries highlight both the opportunities and risks that AI brings.

                As artificial intelligence grows, so does the need for the large-scale computer resources behind it. Resources for training and deploying AI, often called “AI compute”, require powerful hardware. But with growing demand for AI compute, questions about national capacities to achieve AI strategies are arising.

Some of these risks are already materialising into harms to people and societies: bias and discrimination, polarisation of opinions, privacy infringements, and security and safety issues. Trustworthy AI calls for governments worldwide to develop interoperable risk-based approaches to AI governance and a rigorous understanding of AI incidents and hazards.

                    Artificial intelligence and education and skills
                


                As AI rapidly advances, it is crucial to understand how education will be affected. Important questions to consider include: How can AI be compared to humans? How do AI systems perform tasks from various capability domains such as language, reasoning, sensorimotor or social interaction domains? What are the implications for education and training?

                    Digital divide in education
                


                The digital divide signifies unequal access to digital technologies, particularly concerning internet connectivity and device availability, alongside disparities in infrastructure, skills and affordability. These gaps result in unequal opportunities for information access and digital participation.

                Succinct, straightforward, and clear, jargon-free, messaging is required here: what are the (global) challenges and what is at stake (for OECD countries) with respect to this policy sub-issue? Keep in mind user perspective logic by signposting the multiple angles/sectors that can be brought to bear on the issue. 180-300 chars (3-6 lines) is ideal.

                    Generative AI
                


                Generative AI (GenAI) is a category of AI that can create new content such as text, images, videos, and music. It gained global attention in 2022 with text-to-image generators and Large Language Models (LLMs). While GenAI has the potential to revolutionise entire industries and society, it also poses critical challenges and considerations that policymakers must confront.
