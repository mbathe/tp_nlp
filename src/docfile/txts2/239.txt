  2   Foreword   This report is published in the context of AI Watch, the European Commission knowledge service to monitor the  development, uptake and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Europe, launched in December 2018.   AI has become an area of strategic importance with potential to be a key driver of economic development. AI  also has a wide range of potential social implications. As part of its Digital S ingle Market Strategy, the European  Commission put forward in April 2018 a European strategy on AI in its Communication ‘Artificial Intelligence for  Europe ’ COM(2018)237. The aims of the European AI strategy announced in the communication are:    To boost the EU's technological and industrial capacity and AI uptake across the economy, both by the  private and public sectors    To prepare for socio -economic changes brought about by AI    To ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework.   Subsequently, in December 2018, the European Commission and the Member States published a ‘Coordinated  Plan on Artificial Intelligence ’, COM(2018)795, on the development of AI in the EU. The Coordinated Plan  mentions the role of AI Watch to monitor its implementation.   AI Watch monitors European Union’s industrial, technological and research capacity in AI; AI -related policy  initiatives in the Member States; uptake and technical developments of AI; and AI impact. AI Watch has a  European focus within the global landscape. In the context of AI Watch, the Commission works in coordination  with Member States. AI Watch results and analyses are published on the AI Watch Portal  (https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy /ai-watch_en ).  From AI Watch in -depth analyses, we will be able to understand better European Union’s areas of strength and  areas where investment is needed. AI Watch will provide an independent assessment of the impacts and  benefits of AI on growth, jobs,  education, and society.   AI Watch is developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission in collaboration with the  Directorate ‑General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT).   This report addresses the following  objectives of AI Watch:    To provide an overview and analysis of the use and impact of AI in public services.   As part of this objective, this report presents  the analysis of the current landscape of AI use in public services  in the EU as a result of data gathering and survey of EU Member States, and identifies most promising public  service s using AI. It also presents the proposed approach for prioritisation of areas of focus of the analysis,  discussing opportunities, threats, key enablers and barriers for implementation, by looking at relevant ex amples  and available practices, as well as a review of the National AI strategies focus on the public sector.

  5   Executive summary    This report is published in the context of AI Watch, the European Commission knowledge service to  monitor the development, uptake and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Europe , launched in  December 2018 as part of the Coordinated Plan on the Development and Use of AI Made in Europe.    As part of the AI Watch, the role of AI for the public sector is addressed and t he present study  is set out to  provide an Overview and analysis of the use and impact of AI in Public Services . The main goal of  this activity is to gather information on EU Member States' initiatives on the use of AI in public services and  develop a methodology to identify  risks and opportunities, drivers and barriers of the use AI in public services.    This report presents the results of the first exploratory mapping of the use of AI in public services  in the EU , which contributes  to landscaping the current state of the art in the field, and provide s an overview  of Member States efforts to adopt AI -enabled innovations in their government operations.    As demonstrated by an emergent  body of literature and the nascent app lications in the public sector, there  is growing  interest in the use of AI to support re -design of internal service delivery processes  and policy -making mechanisms, to improve quality  and engagement with citizens .    Indeed, when used in a responsible way, the combination of  new, large data sources with  advanced machine learning algorithms can radically improve the operating methods of the public  sector , thus paving the way to pro -active public service delivery models and relieving resource constrained  organisations from mund ane and repetitive tasks.    However, there seems to be an imbalance between the transformative potential and the effective  adoption and use o f AI solutions in government , and there is little evidence of the social and economic  impacts achieved so far , in part due to the limited attention given to research on AI use in the public sector.    This study therefore aims to shed lights on the act ual use of AI technologies in the public sector, providing   a review of AI  adoption  in public services in all 27 EU Member  States, as well as Norway,  Switzerland and UK , and building a  first inventory of 230 cases that represents an  unique reservoir of  knowledge, from which to extract indications, emerging trends, and illustrative examples of current AI usage.    Overall, the a nalysis of the initiatives included in our mapping  shows a wide range  of AI typologies  and use purposes, as well as of government functions and policy areas in which AI solutions are  being  implemented . This evidence will serve as a possible baseline for further analys es and to promote  the use of AI in the European public sector , by either co-developing new joint  solutions or sharing successful  practices  from other administrations.    The mapping results are globally confirmed by the findings of a Survey to Member States and a specific  reflection  conducted on current data and AI governance landscape, leading to conclude  that governments  should see the governance of AI as an extension of existing regulatory tools . Existing  guidelines  are often considered adequ ate to limit the unintended and unwanted consequences of AI deployment ,  however some additional evidence from the playground could bring to revise such diffused perspective .    In this regard, findings from some of the illustrative case studies analysed confirm that ethical  and societal implications of AI adoption should be a matter of high concern for regulators , as  predicated by the policy documents recently delivered at EU and national levels.    In this perspective, whereas the expectations from the use  of AI in government  are high , positive  impact is far from straightforward and should not be taken for granted . A lesson learned from our  analysis is to bear in mind that while small -scale pilot studies or experiments might be successful and the  promises i n case of broader adoption encouraging, providing significant efforts to ensure large r scale usage  of AI inside the public sector  may not be enough to accomplish the ultimate goal of sustainable take -up.    In line with the overall scope of the AI Watch, this study has also carried o ut a review of the AI national  strategies of EU Member States, to assess the focus on public sector , and showing that most  countries are taking several actions to stimulate the use of AI in their public services . Many  national AI strategies include a requirement for experimental projects to learn by doing and sharing  experiences. Some strategies mention special funding programmes to provide financial resources to promote   AI projects in g overnment or to assist start-ups in develo ping GovTech solutions for the public sector.  
  6    To address the need of better understanding the positive and negative consequences of AI use in  public services , our research outlines a propos al for developing an original methodological framework for  impact a ssessment that lays the foundations to  support a future road -mapping of AI in public services  throughout EU  Member States at different levels of governance according to a public -value perspective .   As illustrated by the findings of our analysis, the scope, goals and practices of public sector use of AI  are much diverse : to make an example, an automated decision system to grant protection to asylum  seekers is a task of a far higher delicacy and complexity than increasing the use of digital public services  through predictive analytics. Thus it seems more practical to gear future thinking towards high -potential  impact applications that may have consequences of particular relevance for the populations they target.    Taking into consideration the complexity of inno vation ado ption in the public sector, the approach  proposed aims to define the contextual and individual factors that are crucial for assessing AI  applications , allowing for comparing ex-ante and ex-post impacts resulting from the introduction of AI.    Clearly this is only the starting point of a learning journey, which requires an iterative approach, involving  relevant stakeholders and Member States. In particular, further ‘deep dives ’ at country level through  case studies and thematic analyses are neede d to test and validate the proposed framework ,  while gathering insights and recommendations for further extending it.    In terms of policy implications, this exploratory research has demonstrated the increasing importance given  to AI for the public sector, and the recognition of the role of government as a crucial player in the  design of the regulatory frameworks and tools for the governance ‘with and of ’ AI.    Whereas AI development and adoption is  a cornerstone of the new Digital Strategy to shape the  future of Europe , there are differences between the Member States with regard to the variety of actions  mentioned in the national documents, and the extent in which they may develop  specific ‘policy i nstruments’.    In this respect, there is a need to take a closer look at successful cases of AI implementation and  learn from best practices to help further scaling out of AI solutions among Member States .  Elaborating on  what works and what does not work  is crucial to move the debate forward on the  positive  contribution  of AI to public service delivery and the risks that may actually threat en the quality of services.    This effort resonates well with the Policy and investment recommendations for trustworth y AI  developed by the High Level Expert Group on AI . The document underlines  in fact that ‘ AI has the  potential to play a significant role in improving the quality and efficiency of public services ’, and suggests  giving  to Europe's Public Sector the role of acting as a catalyst of sustainable growth and innovation.    The evidence gathered in this report confirms the need to focus on human -centric AI and the  opportunity of approaching Member States ’ public administrations a s a single platform . This may  be a real game changer, in our opinion, contributing to place the EU as a leading  actor at the global level.    The joint endorsement of statements of principle, however, is only  a first step in the direction of a  common approach  to benefit and cost sharing across different levels of government , grounded  on a reuse logic and huge investments in capacity building of prospective inside users of these innovation.    This leads us to an important  recommendation, related to the use of in novative public procurement to  stimulate and speed up AI adoption , an activity that is likely to further extend the appropriateness and  cost effectiveness of AI take -up in government, meeting the expectations of increasingly proactive service  providers and  policy designers to the changing global landscape, made more co mplicated by the Covid -19.    Future research should therefore go more in -depth to increase our understanding of the  conditions for AI solutions to be implemented  in public services and supporte d by coherent policy  actions . This will require gaining more information about the scope, depth, amount of resou rces and effects  of such actions, also addressing questions of AI governance in different contexts, and provid ing suggestions  on how to best coordinate the efforts of policy -makers and regulators within the data/algorithm sphere .    The insights g ained from these in -depth studies will contribute to design a proposal of a  framework for the use of AI in public services , defining guidelines and a generic implementation  roadmap, based on best practices and the analysis of re -use potential of AI based systems and solutions,  identifying opportunities for collaboration among relevant stakeholders from various sectors.  
  7   1 Introduction   1.1 Background   Rapid advances in computing power, the increasing availability of data and of new algorithms, have recently  led to major breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI)1 and let emerge the great potential of  this ‘new set of technologies ’ to transform our societies and economic systems, becoming one of the most  important technologies of the century for citizens, industry and governments  alike.   The potential benefits  of AI technologies are massive, but risks must also be governed while democratic values  and human rights respected. For this reason, the EU in particular, aims to develop ‘trusted AI ’ based on truly  European ethical and societal values borrowed from  the E uropean Charter of Fundamental Rights. To this end,  building on the declaration of cooperation on AI adopted by all EU Member States, Norway and  Switzerland on  10 April 2018, the Communication ‘Artificial Intelligence for Europe ’ of 25 April 20182 proposed  a  strategy on AI for Europe, which has been endorsed by the European Council in June 2018.   Further, the Coordinated Plan on the Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Made in Europe   was adopted in December 20183, to develop joint actions for clos er and more efficient cooperation between  Member States, Norway, Switzerland and the European Commission in four key areas: increasing investment,  making more data available, fostering talent and ensuring trust.   The overall goal is for the EU to become th e world -leading region in developing and deploying cutting -edge,  ethical and secure AI, promoting  a human -centric approach at global level. The Coordinated Plan provides a  strategic framework for Europe and encourages all Member States to develop their national AI strategies .  These are expected to outline investment targets and implementation measures, while adopting common  indicators to monitor and analyse the success rate of the strategies in place . This effort is supported  by the  establishment of the AI Watch4, the European Commission knowledge service to monitor the development,  uptake and impact of AI for Europe ., jointly implemented by DG CNECT and the Joint Research Centre.   As part of the AI Watch , the potential  of AI for the public sector5 is analys ed through  an extended overview  of the use and i mpact of AI in Public Services , gathering information on  EU Member States'  ongoing  initiatives  and develop ing a methodology to identify risks and opportunities, drivers and barriers of the use AI in public  services.   The role of the public sector in both exploiting - as ‘user’ - the potential of AI, but also - as ‘regulator ’ – setting  out the rules and policy directions for developing ethical AI has been further recognised in the EU ‘Digital  Package ’ launched  on 19th February 2020, which includes the Communication on Shaping Europe’s Digital  Future  [COM(2020) 67 final ]6 and a combined set of policy documents to substantiate the propos ed strategy.   Whereas the Digital Strategy underlines that p romoting the digital transformation of public administr ations  throughout Europe is crucial to make sure ‘technology works for the people ’, the European Strategy for Data   [COM(2020) 66 final]7 emphasises that ‘Europe aims to capture the benefits of better use of data, i ncluding  greater productivity and competitive markets, but also improvements in health and well -being, environment,  transparent governance and convenient public services ’. At the same time, it underscores that ‘public policy can  increase demand for data -enabled offerings, both by increasing the public sector’s own ability to employ data  for decision -making and public services and by updating regulation and sectoral policies to reflect the  opportunities provided by data and ensure that they do not maintain d isincentives for productive data use ’.   In this perspective, th e White paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and  trust [COM(2020) 65 final]8 goes further  to include a section on Promoting the adoption of AI by the public  sector, where it is mentioned that ‘it is essential that public administrations, hospitals, utility and transport  services, financial supervisors, and other areas of public interest rapidly begin to deploy products and services  that rely on AI in their activit ies’, ‘with a specific focus in the area of healthcare and transport ’.                                               1 For the definition of AI see the JRC Report of January 2020, ‘AI Watch - Defining Artificial Intelligence ‘.  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/eu -member -states -sign-cooperate -artificial -intelligence    3 COM(2018) 237 final - Brussels, 25.04.2018   4 https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch_en    5 https://ec.europa.eu/knowled ge4policy/ai -watch/topic/ai -public -sector_en   6 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/communication -shaping -europes -digital -future_en   7 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?qid=1582551099377&uri=CELEX:52020DC0066   8 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/white -paper -artificial -intelligence -european -approach -excellence -and-trust_en  
  8   It is exactly around this dual dimension of governance ‘with and of ’ AI that this study on the use and impact  of AI in public services revolves. On the one side, it is important to explore and assess the effective use and  value added of AI to redesign internal government operations and public services to better serve the citizens  and bus inesses and enhance quality and impact of services, as well as create public private partnerships that  help define the future shape of the ‘digital market ’ in the EU and at a global level. On the other side, it is also  crucial to better understand the pote ntial benefits and risks of the use of AI in the public sector, and the  governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks needed to safeguard human rights and the ethical  deployment of AI, especially in sensitive policy areas and domains of public interest t hat have direct and  stringent implications on the trust -relationship between governments and citizens.   1.2 Objectives   Although many of the methodological developments in AI date back  to more than 50 years  ago, the reason why  we now pay so much attention to AI in general and machine learning (ML) in particular is that the many  applications embedding AI technologies have started to enter into our everyday lives, from machine translations   of texts , to image recognition and music generation, and are increasingly be ing exploited in industry, commerce  and ultimately government.9  AI in fact can contribute to better public services in a variety of ways, for example by enabling smarter analytical  capabilities and better understanding of real -time processes, and deliver s horter and richer feedback loops for  all levels of governance. The opportunities are many, in some cases not even foreseen. For instance, AI can  enable doctors to improve diagnoses and develop therapies for diseases for which none exist yet; it can reduce  energy consumption by optimising uses; it can contribute to a greener agriculture by lessening the need for  pesticides; it can help improve weather prediction s and anticipate disasters; and so on.   The list  of possible applications  is endless and is expect ed to bring solutions to many societal challenges, while  at the same time introducing new directions  of economic development.  However, it is fair to admit that while  the scope and potential of AI outside the public sector are quite clear and compelling, th e same cannot be said  for government and governance related applications. For this reason the AI Watch  aims to provide an Overview   and analysis of the use and i mpact of AI in Public Services .   The key objectives of this service  are as follows :   1. To gather i nformation on EU Member States' initiatives on the use of AI in public services ;   2. To develop a methodology proposal to identify risks and opportunities, drivers and barriers of the use  AI in public service provision  and how to assess their impacts;   3. To define guidelines and a generic implementation roadmap  for AI in public services.   As a result of these activities an overview of the use and added value of AI tools supporting public  service delivery  will be provided, looking at the most relevant examples in prioritized public ser vices. Further,  the analysis will develop a framework  to assess social and economic impact s of AI use in public  service s, and will draw up recommendations for further development of AI -based systems and solu tions in  government. In doing so it will propose a roadmap for the use of AI in public services , based on best  practices of the analysi s of the re -use potential of AI -based systems and solutions, also identifying opportunities  for collaboration among relev ant stakeholders from various sectors.   This report present s the results of the first -year activities of the AI Watch  in the area of AI for public sector. To  this end, after this introduction comprising a brief overview of objectives and methodological appr oach ( Section  1) the report is structured as follows: Section 2  discusses the main findings of the landscaping of AI in public  services in the EU, with a review of the literature and results of the mapping of AI use in the EU . This  also  integrates  the insights from a Survey of EU Member States conducted in January 2020 and  the knowledge  gathered at the 1st Peer Learning Workshop of February 2020; Section 3  provides illustrative examples and  case studies of the use of AI in public services in the EU, focusin g on priority services and AI governance aspects;  this is followed by a review of the National AI strategies focus ing on public sector ( Section 4 ); Section 5   outlines the rationale and approach for developing a framework  to assess the social and economic i mpacts of  AI use in public services.

  9   1.3 Methodology   The methodological approach followed to achieve the objectives of AI Watch  is based on desk research,  conceptualisation work, expert consultation within JRC and other EC services, industry, academia, think tanks,  national and sub -national government representatives through workshops, focus groups, interviews with  leading stakeho lders, in -depth case studies, as well as impact modelling and simulation.   In particular, this report of the AI Watch  delves into  the following three main  activities:   1) Exploratory research and landscaping of the use of AI in support of public services in E U Member States  through mapping and case studies;   2) Proposal  of a methodological framework for social and economic impact assessment,  after the  identification of the most promising public services using AI;   3) Design of a generic implementation roadmap  for the  use of AI in public services, with guidelines and  evidence based recommendations .  1.3.1  Mapping and case studies of AI use in public services   Following the inception phase of the research, which defined the approach to be follow ed, an exploratory  analysis to id entify the main challenges for the use of AI in the public sector  was conducted. The  review of the evolving context of AI in the public sector allowed the research team to identify emerging  strategies and practices across EU Member States so as to learn fr om concrete experiences of deployment of  AI in public services. This resulted in the collection of information on 230 initiatives  of AI use in EU Member  States, and an analysis of their main characteristics, technological dimensions and value drivers.   Building on this preliminary analysis, a number of case studies were selected and investigated  by looking  at promising initiatives in priority areas , such as agriculture, social services, healthcare, mobility and  transport, as well as public administration in  general. This included also a focus on AI and data governance,  with specific case studies in different legal and administrative jurisdictions.   In parallel to this activity, an in-depth review of scientific and grey literature  has been conducted, complemented  by a policy analysis of National Strategies of EU Member States with a specific focus on the use of  AI in the public sector , examining the strategic documents  officially adopted by the end of 2019,  particularly  those of co untries that are considered in the vanguard or are developing promising or innovative approaches.   After  this preliminary overview, and with the aim of defining a common approach to data gathering, and  identifying initiatives in priority public service are as, an initial survey on the use and impact of AI in public  services in EU Member States  was designed. Following an internal review and consultation with experts, the  survey was launched in January 2020. The aim was to gather detailed information on all EU  Member States'  initiatives on the use of AI in public services and to provide an overview of the use and added value of AI tools  supporting public service delivery by examining the most relevant examples in prioritized public services.   To this end, the wa y proposed in approaching AI in the delivery of public services  is to better understand them  as comprising three large categories, namely: government -to-government applications (or G2G uses of AI in  applications within and between public administrations at  different levels and for their own operations),  government -to-business (or G2B uses of AI applications for the delivery of public services to businesses) and  government -to-citizen (or G2C uses of AI applications aimed at delivering public services to citi zens).  Our  research has thus built a set of relevant illustrative examples and available practices  to support  identifying most promising public services using AI in EU Member States , including through a review of the focus  on the public sector of National AI Strategies officially adopted by Member States and available in English .   1.3.2  Developing  a methodology proposal for  impact assessment  of AI in public services   Following internal discussions during the inception phase of the research, an analysis of the stat e of the art   with regard to possible approaches to assess impact of AI was conducted. This included a literature and policy  review, and the identification of main research gaps, theoretical frameworks and practical use cases.   As a result of this prelimina ry review , a first outline of a conceptual framework to assess the social and  economic impact s of AI in public services has been  developed . This is rooted in a ‘public value perspective ’ to  allow flexibility in the research approach, while providing rigoro us assessments of the delivery of the expected  effects of AI.  
  10   The research , in fact, revealed  the need to have a better understanding of what typ ology  of AI is being used   and how i t is possible to develop and adopt the different ‘set of technologies ’ considered as AI in the public  sector, what are the legal and ethical dimensions influencing both perceptions and use of AI in public services,  and what are the existing organisational practices of the administrations using AI.  Thus the proposed framework   takes into consideration the complexity of the adoption of digital technologies in general - and AI in  particular  - in public administrations and the response to their introduction by civil servants and citizens alike.  It follows the established understan ding that AI does not have an impact on its own, but enable s changes  leading to impact s, which are also influenced by end users’ response.   The analysis also identified the need of further research on the broader social and economic impacts  of AI in public  services , aiming at ex-ante and ex-post analys es of AI adoption and implementation, rather  than focusing narrowly on technical characteristics per-se. This requires defining relevant social and economic  indicators , being representative of the context in w hich AI is embedded and  integrating in the analysis other  direct and indirect factors  that are also  influencing impact.   For this purpose, a suitable framework  to assess potential social and economic impacts of the use of  AI to support public services  was proposed, together with an analysis of the opportunities, threats, key  enablers and barriers to implementation emerging from its application to a selected number of case studies .  The results of the framework application will be discussed with Member States  for further implementation.   1.3.3  Stakeholders engagement, peer learning and road -mapping  AI in the public sector   The ultimate goal of th is activity of the AI Watch is to propos e the develop ment of  a basic framework for  the assessment of AI use in public services , with guidelines and a generic implementation roadmap , based  on best practices and the results of the analysis of the re -use potential of AI systems and solutions that could  be further developed through piloting of joint initiatives across Member States in the European Union.   To this end, the research activities carried out so far have been reflecting on the technological, legal, economic  and social implications derived specifically from the use of AI as well as the barriers that may prevent the fu ll  exploitation of the AI potential in the public sector. This analysis will serve to further substantiate the design  of the proposed roadmap for AI adoption in public services within the EU .   To achieve this objective, a crucial aspect to consider for dev eloping a roadmap that would combine scientific  rigour with practical application potential and policy -relevance, is how to  engage with relevant networks of  experts and stakeholders , as well as access strategic partners, including Member States , at both po licy and  technical levels.   For this purpose, and in agreement with DG C ONNECT and the AI Watch Steering Group, consisting of  members  nominated by the Member States Group on AI & Digital Europe Industry (DEI) (a lso known as the  ‘AI Sherpa  Group ’), it has be en decided to involve actively the Member States representatives through the ‘eGovernment  Action Plan Steering Board ’. To this end, a presentation to the 10th Meeting of the eGovernment Action Plan  Steering Board on 21st June 2019 marked the beginning  of the engagement with Member States, which is  crucial to gather information that would not be possible to collect  otherwise and have first -hand knowledge of  processes and impact creation, as well as identifying suitable case studies for in -depth qualitative a nd  quantitative analys es.  Therefore, jointly with C ONNECT/H4, a Peer-Learning process with and among Member States  has been  initiated to facilitate exchange of lessons learned and possibly faster adoption of AI -enabled systems and  technological solutions i n the public sector. This included building synergies with activities conducted by JRC  with DIGIT as part of relevant actions of the ISA2 Programme (i.e. ELISE and Innovative Public Services), also  ensuring complementarities among the various tasks of AI W atch and other research  of JRC.   The 1st Workshop on AI use and impact in public services  was organised on 11 -12 February 2020 in  Brussels, and discussed the preliminary results of the overview of AI in public services and the proposed  approach to data gathering and development of the methodological framework for impact assessment.   The 2nd Peer Learning Workshop  on AI and data governance  will serve to validate the results of the  research, and in particular the proposed methodology for impact assess ment and the suggested roadmap for  introducing AI in the public sector. To this end the workshop  will focus not only on the technological aspects of  AI, but also on their implications in terms of quality, fairness and inclusiveness of public services . It w ill also  consider the governance and policy -makers’ dilemmas stemming from possible , emerging  alternative regulatory  mechanisms, ultimately aimed at enhancing transparency, strengthening trust and generating public value.   
  11   2 Landscaping AI in public services  in the EU   2.1 A journey in an unchartered territory: between myth and  reality   As we have mentioned above (see §1.1) Artificial Int elligence (AI) is considered a ‘new set of  technologies ’ which have (re)gained great attention recently among academia, policy ma kers, businesses and  citizens alike. Growth in computing power, availability of data and progress in algorithms, have in fact turned  AI into one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. As indicated by the Communication on AI  Made in Europe,  ‘Like the steam engine or electricity in the past, AI is transforming the world ’. However, socio economic, legal and ethical impacts have to be carefully addressed. Deployed wisely, AI holds the promise of  addressing some of the world’s most intractable challenges. But the significance of its positive impact is  confront ed by its poten tially destabilising effects on some key aspects of economic and social life.   Public administration play s a vital role in the development and uptake of AI . However, most of the   current debate  tends to place government either in the role of ‘regulatory acto r’ or at best ‘facilitator ’, i.e. setting  out the framework conditions for private actors and citiz ens to deploy and use AI in an ethical mann er. This  leaves the alternative role of the public sector as ‘first buyer ’ and direct beneficiary of AI take -up an d  implementation rather obscure, if not neglected. In other words , the current policy discourse focus es on  the governance ‘of’ AI, far less on the governance ‘with’ AI.   Indeed, under the first respect, the EU Member States have taken a firm direction with the signature, already in  2018, of the  Declaration on Cooperation on AI , containing the commitment of joining forces and the  engag ement  in a common policy approach, to leverage on the achievements and investments in AI of the  European research and bus iness community, while at the same time dealing with related social, economic,  ethical and legal issues appropriately.  This adds to the intense policy design work at national level, the results  of which will be presented later in this publication . Such efforts document the intention of European  governments to  be the main actor s in regulating the use of AI in society and stimulate its development through   e.g. a clearer  discipline of access to valuable data sets .   However , and mirroring a trend that has faste ned its pace in the last 3 -5 years in the private sector worldwide,  the adoption of AI within public administration processes and internal operations has the pote ntial to  provide  enormous benefit s in terms of  improve d efficiency and effectiveness of policy  making and service delivery to  business and citizens, ultimately enhancing their level of satisfaction and trust in the quality of governance and  public service . Nevertheless, the role of government as ‘user’ of AI technologies has received far less  atten tion than the ‘regulator ’ role in the strategies  – as the analysis presented in Section 4  will describe   further, by looking at the focus on the use of AI for the public sector in the current policy  documents of EU  Member States .  This imbalance of interest s is echoed in the AI research field.  As a recent literature review highlights,  the focus of research on AI take -up lies - almost exclusively - in the development and applicability of AI in the  private sector. Only a very small portion (59 out of 1438) of t he articles published  between 2000 and 2019  discuss AI for  and in  the public sector (Desouz a et al., 2019) . Empirical studies on the use of algorithmic models  in policy making processes ha ve been scarce so far, which has limited the academic understanding of the use  and the e ffects of them (Kolkman, 2020) . Now, while  it is quite  likely that the number of publications  on AI in  government will increase in the near  future , this will probably not be enough to fill in the gap with the private  sector. Arguably, to ensure that AI provide s benefits to all citizens and ensure s the public value of its use, there  ought to be more attention to its use in the ‘business of government ’, also at a cademic level .   In fact, many current applications of AI – such as those presented in this report – have been design ed to solve  a number of problems of e.g.  resource allocation, large dataset  intelligence , scenario building and predicti on, or  customer rela tion management that are typical  of both business and government  settings  (Mehr, 2017) .  Ultimately, with the progress of take -up, the nee d will also arise to produce impact assessment models and  instruments to examine the consequences of AI adoption in the  various policy  and service  domains and to the  respective constituent and beneficiary communities . An exercise in that direction is propo sed as part of this  research (see Section 5 ).   In this respect, as we will discuss later on, it must be noticed that de spite a general understanding of the  potential benefits and risks of AI, the term  itself  is still not clearly defined and often used with different  meanings , sometimes also changing over time. For instance, d ata scientists attach a different meaning to what  they refer to as AI than citizens who commonly see it as a tangible technology - e.g. a machine or a robot (Krafft  et al., 2019) .  
  12   Not surprisingly , already the f irst definition of AI, proposed almost 65 years ago by John McCarthy et al.10 and  which is echoed also in the European Commission ’s 2018 Communication on AI11, considered the term both  from a technology and an application standpoint. Several definitions have  been proposed since then and are  currently under discussion, including th ose advances by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence12  and the OECD13, as well as other proposals at national level14. Within this context, an operational definition  has been proposed as part of the AI Watch  to provide guidance in researching AI (Samo ili et al., 2020) .   In this report, for the purpose of the analysis of th e use and impact of AI in public service , we consider AI as a  ‘special form ’ of ICTs, capable of displaying intelligent behaviour and completing  tasks normally said to require  human intelligence , and we propose to define its perimeter by the terms Percepti on, Reasoning and Action, each  identifying a (relatively) distinct and separate cluster of research and application strands .15   Perception  stands for the capacity of an intelligent machine, be it a piece of softw are or a robot, to  understand ( give meaning to) the signals coming from the external world - such as images, either still or  in motion, and sound, e.g. music or speech. Evidently this strand has been quite successful in its  achievements, not only for the business, but also for the consu mer market: prominent implementation  examples include ambient recognition systems for the unmanned driving of vehicles, virtual assistance (Siri,  Cortana, etc.) on computers and smart phones, but also stand -alone speakers (Alexa, Google Home etc.),  as well  as tune and score identifiers and generators (Shazam, Soundhound, etc.).    Reasoning  is probably both the rationale and the unattained (many would say, unattainable) goal of AI  development: the goal to replicate/improve a human being’s capacity to analyse and draw inferences from  the data and information received from the external world. The progress made on this front is epitomized  by the performance of IBM’s Deep Blue chess playing computer in 1996, when it defeated the world  champion Garry Kasparov in ga me 1 of a 6 -game match, but ultimately lost by a score of 2 -4 as Kasparov  won three and drew two of the following five games .16 About a quarter of century later, a big gap still exists  between expectations and reality, as far as the reasoning capacity of in telligent machines is concerned .17  This is a very important note, which can be consistently retrieved from the evidence provided in the  remainder of this report.    Action  is at least as relevant as the other two fronts in the diffusion of AI solutions as ‘game changers ’ in  a wide variety of application domains: progress in that direction can be measured both in software industry  (examples abound of chatbots and recommendation engines, which have automated first level Q&A within  online C ustomer Relations Manage ment - CRM systems or brought personalised advertising to higher  sophistication in suggesting purchasing options based on past behavioural history) and in hardware  manufacturing (think of the prosthetic limb technology in medicine and of the limited capaci ty, yet already  available on the mass market, robotized lawn mowers or vacuum cleaners). To this cluster, the recent surge  of the ‘Industry 4.0 ’ movement  should be appended , leading to  the proliferation of new and advanced  solutions integrating  Internet of  Things ( IoT) with digital technologies  – with AI as a prominent part of them  – into the robotized and unmanned ‘Factory of the F uture ’.18                                              10 John McCarthy et al (1955) Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence: ‘ For the present purpose the  artificial intelligence problem is taken to be that of making a mach ine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so  behaving .’ The suggested topics for study included: ‘automatic computers and programs for them; programming computers to use a  language; neuron nets; machine self -improvement; classifyi ng abstractions; and two areas (that) (…) would not be part of AI for many years  — how to measure the complexity of calculations, and randomness and creativity. http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmou th/dartray.pdf    11 ‘Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions – with  some degree of autonomy – to achieve specific goals. AI -based systems can be purely software -based , acting in the virtual world (e.g. voice  assistants, image analysis software, search engines, speech and face recognition systems) or AI can be embedded in hardware d evices (e.g.  advanced robots, autonomous cars, drones or Internet of Things applications) .

Incidentally, our definition complies with that used in the 2018 EC Communication on AI [COM(201 8) 237 final] – see footnote 11.   16 Wikipe dia (2020) Deep Blue (chess computer). Retrieved 22 March 2020 at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)   17 Despite the term ‘’intelligence’’ to describe these applications, they frequently do not embody any form of intelligence as h umans  do as  they frequently struggle to distinguish between cause and effects. However, due to their ability to complete (specific) diffi cult tasks or find  insights in large volumes of data, the term intelligence has been associated to them.   18 On this see for i nstance ‘Factories of the Future’ , the European Union's €1.15 billion public -private partnership (PPP) for advanced  manufac turing research and innovation, which is the EU's main programme for realising the next industrial revolution: material ising  Factorie s 4.0 - https://www.effra.eu/factories -future 
  13   Over the past 3 -5 years, the perception of an increasing maturity and reliability of AI has led many observers  to spea k enthusiastically in terms of an upcoming revolution, highlighting the need to fast move towards the  implementation of credible business cases for its take-up, particularly in the enterprise market. To a great  extent, Google Trends confirm this fastening and widening of interest for AI as a field of study, which has  reached the all -time peak of popularity (:100) right in the  current months,  as the following graph displays.     FIGURE 1 AI INTEREST OVER TIME,  WORLDWIDE. SOURCE: TRENDS.GOOGLE.COM   However, as multiple studies  have confirmed, the specific AI technologies (not to speak about custom solutions)  belonging to the three clusters above are so numerous and diversified that only by nar rowing the focus on each  of them it becomes possible to assess their actual time to market. This is recognised b y the conceptual  distinction between three forms  of AI: Artificial Superintelligence, General AI and Narrow AI .   Artificial Superintelligence  refers to a hypothetical situation in the future where technology outperforms  human intelligence. This is more present in the realm of science fiction, but researchers and ethicists are already  discussing what steps could be taken today to avoid a scenario w here AI surpasses the point of ‘’technological  singularity’’ and turns against the interests of humankind. General AI  refers more to ICT systems having similar  forms of intelligence as humans, and the debate here is more focused on duplicating the inner wo rkings of the  human brain and applying this to a machine. However, just as the superintelligence scenario, General AI is far  from being real and might take decades (or longer) to manifest. Finally, Narrow AI  comprises robotized systems  and applications tha t are considered to be ‘intelligent ’, not because they imitate human behaviour, but more  modestly because they are capable of carrying out tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence, effort  and time to an unsustainable extent – due to unfavourab le environmental conditions for human work or the  slow pace at which our brain could perform large scale data analyses.   The focus of this research is set on applications  which are currently present in our societies – notably in  government and public service – and considered as part of Narrow AI , while t he other forms are not taken  into consideration due to their futuristic  nature , impossible to study in a practical or empirical context . Howev er,  even with this narrow er focus on existing or viable, rather than futur e or hypothetical  solutions, the term remains  extremely broad and difficult to operationalise. This is confirmed by a recent overview made as part of the AI  Watch , highlight ing the large variety of keywords associated with AI as a research theme (Samoili et al., 2020) .  Our working definition of A I complies with  the proposal from AI Watch19 and is aligned with that of the  OECD  AI Policy Observatory20. We also build on the recent EU White Paper on AI published in February 2020, which  refers succinctly to AI as ‘a collection of technologies that combine data, algorithms and computing power ’21  and on t he OECD general reference to AI as ‘A machine -based system that can, for a given set of human defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments ’.  For the scope of this report, w e suggest to consider these proposals  in combination with the definition of   algorithmic system by the Committee of Experts MSI -AUT in the 2018 Draft Recommendation of the Committee  of Ministers to Member States on the huma n rights impacts of algorithmic systems entitled ‘Addressing the  impacts of Algorithms on Human Rights ’: ‘Applications that, often using mathematical optimisation techniques,  perform one or more tasks such as gathering, combining, cleaning, sorting, classi fying and inferring (ed.  personal) data, as well as selection, prioritisation, recommendation and decision -making. Relying on one or more  algorithms to fulfil their requirements in the settings in  which they are applied, algorithmic systems automate  activi ties in a way that allows the creation of adaptive services at scale and in real time. ’22                                               19 https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch_en    20 https://oecd.ai    21 European Union White Paper on Artificial Intelligence – A European approach to excellence and trust, COM(2020) 65 final,  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission -white -paper -artificial -intelligence -feb2020_en.pdf    22 https://rm.coe.int/draft -recommendation -of-the-committee -of-ministers -to-states -on-the-hu/168095eecf    
  14   These AI applications have a variety of capabilities  already noted as critical by extant literature, which  include,  but are not limited to:     Collecting, processing and analysing information from large numbers of digital images or  videos  (Centre for Public Impact, 2017) .    Interacting with service users or citizens/customers  in a semi -automated manner through  chatbots and virtual assistants or conducting sentimen t analyses  based on the interpretation of  textual data (Chui et al., 2018; Eggers et al., 2017)  supported by Natural Language Processing ( NLP) to  understand audio and text.    Analysing huge volumes of data to make  predictions  which are way more comprehensive and  accurate and/or support human or automated  (e.g. algorithm -based) decisions  (Centre for Public Impact,  2017; Eggers et al., 2017)  including for the prevention of crime or an enhanced intellig ence of future  trends in our economies and societies.    Receiving case-based  guidance from past experiences as well as support in the automation of  processes and tasks  (both at individual level – think of surgery operations – and at organisational level  – such as for monitoring and reporting).     The difficulty of operationalising such high -level definitions is evident, though, even more so when dealing with  AI use in the public services. In fact, machine learning techniques or predictive models do not intera ct per se   with the world around them but only as embedded in existing software or hardware . Studying the development  and use of algorithmic models in the public sector is worthwhile, but only shows a narrow view of the algorithms  themselves and not how they are embedded into existing infrastructure and work practices. Further to that, t he  decision to ado pt an AI solution within a public organisation  is not a straightforward process, with even more  difficulties lying in the use of the AI solution with the end users, be t hey civil servants or citizens  or businesses .  There can be indeed a great difference be tween what developers aim to achieve with their AI and how it is  functioning in practice.   To clarify this aspect, Figure 2 acts as an illustration to highlight the various steps AI innovation must undertake  before it is able to provide impact to society. Each of these steps  come with their own challenges:  high quality  data is required before trustworthy and accur ate AI models  can be developed;  adoption of AI solutions requires  an innovative mindset ; and adoption of AI solutions by the end users will require significant trust and  understandability of the results, just to name a few. In this report, the scope lies primarily into  the last two  steps: the adoption of the organisation  (e.g. the testing of pilots of AI or the decision to procure a solution) and  the adoption by end users (routine -based use of AI in processes). It does have to be noted that this illustration  is a simpli fication of reality, since in practice many of these processes overlap, interact with each other and are  not linear as the figure may suggest.     FIGURE 2 AI: FROM DEVELOPMEN T TO PRACTICE (AUTHO RS OWN ELABORATION)    •Requirements for AI development  (e.g. data) •Design considerations •Predictive performance Design•Pilots •Innovative procurement •Innovative culture •Perceived value for the  organizationAdoption •Integration into work practices •Interpretation and use of AI •Organisational changes and  reforms •Actual value Use
  15   Furthermore, when  new technologies are adopted in the public sector, grasping their full potential is challenged  by the difficulty  of aligning it with the required  change s in organisational processes and structures, not to speak  of staff acceptance and skills . With the ado ption and use of AI technology, it is likely that this process is not  going to be any different. In line with this recogni tion, most of the literature on AI in the public sector  also recommend to focus on the quick wins, before tackling more structural cha llenges  (Desouza et  al., 2020; OECD, 2019) . While  some of these q uick wins can already provide value and convenience to citizens,  only time will tell us whether the use of AI will help bring more transformative impacts or suffer from the same  issues  faced by earlier waves of g overnment  digitalisation.   Consequently, it is the combination of software and hardware with human behaviour  that possibly  leads to an impact , however measured, or to a transformative change of the previous external conditions . In  other words , most of the AI described in this report is embedded in applications that are the result of a  development process where  machine learning – but also traditional programming – plays an important role.  Researching the use of a single machine learning algorithm is likely to be too narrow, since most AI applicatio ns  use a variety of algorithms (Sousa et al., 2019) . Since  our a nalysis  aims to unravel the consequences and  impact s of the use of AI systems in public services, an approach that examines how the AI as a system  works in real world  is therefore preferred (Kitchin, 2017)  and our research focus differs from other studies  dealing with the use of machine learning algorithms, the algorithms themselves or the difficulties of gaining a  high enough accuracy rate on a specific model.   As a matter o f fact, the combined  datafication of society with the digitalisation of public administration  worldwide , has led to an increasing effort to use  massive volumes of data available to improve  governmental practices . However, as often, the promise of ICT s does not tr uly lives up to its expectations   (Bannister & Connolly, 202 0). To a great extent,  the application journey of AI in the public sector fits the  more established research tradition of eGovernment : the use of  ICTs to improve government services.  Since the 1990's there has been great enthusiasm worldwide about  introducing new digital technologies within  governmental organisations to improve effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery, make organisations  more citizen -centric and improve trust in government . However, many researchers have questioned whether  the gr eat investments in ICT s by governments over the past decades have actually achieved the significant  impact they were supposed to bring [ for a review on this see (Misuraca et al., 2013)  and (Savoldelli et al., 2014) ].   Indeed, the potential benefits are massive but, so far , there is limited empirical evidence that the use of  AI in government is achieving the intended results successfully.  Understandably, often the developers  of the AI systems would describe great properties to their AI, backed up with  technical assessments of the  models’ performance and accuracy.  Despite this, there have been mentions that the predictive accuracy of some  AI solutions is not much better than ‘simple’ logistic regressions based on only a few variables, especially when  trying to predict social outcomes (Christodoulou et al., 2019; Salganik et al., 2020) . Moreover , these  assessments tell us very lit tle on how AI technologies are used in practice and how consequently they could  lead to improvements in public services. Th us, in order to understand the effects of AI use  in governments, an  approach which takes into consideration how the technology is use d will give more insights on how AI provides  impact (Cordella & Iannacci, 2010; Rahwan et al., 2019) . This approach should keep in mind that while A I  technologies can be the same, previous research on the use of technologies in organisations highlights that  similar technologies can in fact provide very different outcomes in organisations, potentially leading to  unanticipated outcomes in some  settings (Bailey & Barley, 2019) .   In fact, as a recent JRC report on Exploring Digital Government in the EU  has highlighted, most digital  transformations in the public sector seem to be guided by hopes and dreams, rather than confirmed  by empirical evidence  (Barcevičius et al., 2019) . Exploiting available information  and advances in ICTs and   infrastructu re across the various eG overnment waves , public sector organisation s have strived  to become more  data-driven and use digital transformation to extract value from large datasets, so as to increase their capacity  for problem -solvin g and ability to tackle major societal challenges. However, significant  barrier s and constraints   have prevented  a more diffused  adoption of ICTs – and potentially also AI – by governmental organisation s so  far, notably including  lack of dedicated resources, knowledge, organisational re sistance and other specific  factors , such as quality of available datasets . This has led to a significant gap in the take -up rates  between   private and public sector organisations, where the former are usually  much faster in using best of breed   solutions  to improve their products and services and stay ahead of competition . In fact, even when the  technologies do get adopted by the organisation, public workers may use the technologies in ways not imagined  by the developers or the managers, such as treating AI with scepticism or ignoring it recommendations entirely  (Bailey & Barley, 2019) . 
  16   Technology wise, this report proposes a classification based on 10 application domains – called ‘AI typ ologi es’  (see Table 1 )–  which is broadly aligned, despit e some naming differences, with both the operational taxonomy  proposed by the AI Watch and an earlier one – specific for AI in government - also based on 10 domains, by  Wirtz et al., 2019 . Naturally, as the development of AI  is ever ongoing, this may make the classification proposed  here very quickly  outdated . However , as shown in the following table,  speaking in terms of application areas  allows overcoming the limitations of too technology -oriented  taxonomies,  focusing on the various machine  learning algorithms and other approaches also considered to be  part of  AI. Another merit of the proposed  classification is that if one looks at the last column on the right, the observed number of cases in the European  public sector shows  an interesting variety among:    A relative majority (51 cases) of ‘Chatbots, Intelligent Digital Assistants, Virtual Agents and  Recommendation Systems ’;   An interesting number (36 cases) of applications in the domains of ‘Predictive Analytics, Pattern  Recognition Simulation and Data Visualisation ’;   Other two typ ologies, both of the same size (29 cases), which are related on the one hand to ‘Computer  Vision and Identity Recognition ’ and on the other hand to ‘Expert and Rule -based Systems, Algorithmic  Decision Making ’.   Taken together, these four AI typ ologies constitute about two thirds (143 of 230) of the current database under  investigation and therefore communicate a clear orientation of the surveyed initiatives in terms of adoption.   TABLE 1 AI IN GOVERNMENT. CU RRENT AND PROSPECTIV E TECHNOLOGIES AND U SES   AI typology  Description  Example  No. of  cases   Audio Processing  These AI applications are capable of detecting  and recognizing sound, music and other audio  inputs, includin g speech, thus enabling the  recognition of voices and transcription of  spoken words.

In Latvia, the Chatbot UNA is  used to help  answer frequently asked questions regarding the  process of registering a company  52  Cognitive Robotics, Process  Automation  and Connected  and Automated Vehicles  The common trait of these AI technologies is  process automation, which can be a chieved  through robotized hardware  or software  The use of self -driving snowploughs in an airport  in Norway in order to improve the clearing of  snow on runways.  16    Computer Vision and  Identity Recognition  AI applications from this list category use  some form of image, video or facial  recognition to gain information on the  external environment and/or the identity of  specific persons or objects.    In Estonia, the SATIKAS system is in used which  is capable of  detecting mowed (or the lack of  mowed) grassland s on satellite imagery  29  Expert and Rule -based  Systems , Algorithmic  Decision Making  The reason why these apparently distant AI  developments are joined into a single  application is their prevalent orientati on to  facilitate or fully automate decision making  processes of potential relevance not only to  the private but also to the public sector.  Nursery child recruitment system used in  Warsaw.  The algorithm considers data provided  by parents during the registra tion, calculates the  score and automatically assigns children into  individ ual nurseries.  29    AI-empowered Knowledge  Management  The common element here is the underlying  capacity of embedded AI to create a  searchable collection of case descriptions,  texts and other insights to be shared with  experts for further analysis.   In Slovakia, an AI system is used in the  government to assist in the browsing and finding  of relevant semanti c data  12  Machine Learning, Deep  Learning  While almost all the other categories of AI use  some form of Machine Le arning, this residual  category refers to AI solutions which are not  suitable for the other classifications.  In Czechia, AI is used in social services to  facilitate citizens to stay in their natural  environment for as long as possible  17  Natural Language  Processing, Text Mining  and  Speech Analytics  These AI applications are capable of  recognising and analysing sp eech, written text  and communicate back.  In Dublin, an AI system analyses citizen opinions  in the Dub lin Region for an ove rview of their  most pressing concerns  by analysing local twitter  tweets with various algorithms.  19  Predictive Analytics,  Simulation and Data  Visualisation  These AI solutions learn from large datasets  to identify patterns in the data  that are  consequently used to visualise, simulate or  predict new configurations.  Since 2012, the Zurich City Police have been  using s oftware that predicts burglaries. Based on  these predictions, police could be forwarded to  check these areas and limit bur glaries from  happening.  37  Security Analytics and  Threat Intelligence  These refer to AI systems which are tasked  with analysing and monitoring security  information and to prevent or detect malicious  activities.  In the Norwegian National Security Authority  a  new system  is used based on machine learning  is enabling the  automatic analysis of any  malware detected to improve cybersecurity  11 
  17   As any classification , this also is prone to discussion and refinement , as some AI applications could be part of  multiple categories. For example , most AI applications put in other categories can also be named expert and  rule-based systems , based on machine learning or a combination of both. Therefore, the proposed taxonomy  should not be regarded as a conclusive determination of the types of AI existing in nature. Rather, its  implementation  provides an understandable groundwork to help define which AI applications are part of the  inventory of cases gathered so far  and to assi st in the future understanding of new AI use cases.  Thus, th e goal  of this exercise is not to have absolute ontological rigour, but to provide a heuristic tool , useful in interpreting  the variety of AI solutions currently in use.   In future iterations of th e study, the taxonomy may be further refined as to also include the various machine  learning algorithms used in the development of the AI systems. This could enable additional analysis on the  main dominant algorithmic techniques used in the development suc h as various regression algorithms,  classification algorithms, clustering algorithms, association rules, principal component analysis and various  neural network approaches23 (Sousa et al., 2019)  in combination with the resulting capabilities and applications  made available through these AI techniques . Such adaptive approach seems more in line with the  emergence  of AI in the delivery of public services . While still in its infancy in many countries, this phenomenon is  expected to nurture the development of applications at national and local administration lev el as the further  digitization and datafication of the public sector. Such evolution, in line with the planned setting up of EU -wide  data and computing infrastructures, will allow for the creation of enhanced capabilities and novel applications  over time.   These capabilities  and applications  could also play a significant role in various governmental tasks related to   policy making . For example, and  based on the evidence gathered from the case studies reported herein, an  early data intelligence exercise  can assist  public decision  makers in detect ing emergent societal problems or  citizens’ concerns much promptly , enabling more timely and accurate policy responses . This is being  experimented in the analysis of business data from tax declarations or patient beha viour according to medical  prescriptions. For policies or services already in implementation, activities like the sentiment analysis of citizens  during interaction with government websites or simply on social media could assist in the measurement of  satisf action rates  and in the promotion of further participation. As far as customer care and service  improvement are concerned, the profiling and therefore classification of users according to their interests or  needs can lead to more tailored and appropriate d eliveries and quality targets. Finally, semi -automated CRM  systems using online chatbots and intelligent agents can be pushed to the limit of integrating general or specific  advice with recommendations on how to further improve the user’s experience.   Howev er, this overview of the general challenges of AI adoption and effective use in the public sector would  not be exhaustive, if we did not mention the debate linked to the concerns  on possible downsides and  misuses of AI . Among these, o ne of the biggest chal lenges is the characteristic of machine learning technolog y  being  considered as  a 'black box' . It is extremely challenging, even for the programmers, to understand how  machine learning algorithms function. Whereas it is possible to understand which kind of  data is used and to  define  the outputs of the system, the inner workings of the algorithm are incomprehensible for many, if not all,  lay people, posing challenges in terms of accountability, liability and trust (Craglia et al., 2018) .   There is also a risk, when  AI systems  use historical data , to import and amplify  biases  which users might be  unaware of  (Wirtz et al. , 2019) . Additional ly, the exclusive reliance o n online data for policy making expose s to  the risk of excluding the voices that are not captured by digital means , further enlarging  the digital  divide that exists  in our societies. A  further risk of AI relates to  the protection  of privacy  due to the fact that   many devices and services gather data without the user's full understanding of what is done with it afterwards   (Wirtz et al., 2019) . This risk is increased when an extended use of algorithms  allows to infer information about  individuals they h ave not even voluntarily shared, such as sensor or location data, leading for instance to the  detection of health conditions , a private and sensitive data, from apparently public or non -sensitive information,  and to inform potentially discriminatory treatm ent (Floridi, 2017) .  Finally,  there are economic and social concerns  linked to the deployment of AI  in general, and specifically in  the public sector . First, the fear  of job losses once AI takes over many tasks previously conducted by humans i s  of particular interest in public administration , with regard to the debate on the changing nature of work due to  the rapid advancements in technology and automation , which are i ncreasingly substituting both routine and  cognitive tasks, leading to  concern especially in  older generations.                                               23 One could for example search for the various online machine learning ‘cheat sheets’’ shared by data scientists online with an overview  of all the mathematical equations and purpo ses of the different machine learning algorithms and methods . 
  18   Recruitment systems , career models, and job organisational structures are already being transformed by AI and  will be even more in the future, raising a number of questions for researchers and policymakers , with regard to  the emergence of new educational and lifelong learning  needs,  or the perspect ive to re-engineer social  protection and healthcare systems, as well as the entire organisation of the economy  and society, with clear  impact s on the way public administration operate s and public services are provided.   2.2 Results of the first mapping of  AI use in public services   For th e reason s explained in the previous Section  (§2.1), and particularly  to pave the ground for the development  of our AI impact assessment’s conceptual and methodological framework with an extended state of the art   analysis , the first empirical activity conducted as part of the AI W atch has been that of landscaping the use  of AI in public services across Europe . To this  end, during the period May 2019 – February 2020,  we have  collected a set of 230 initiatives  using  AI in public services ( broadly  defined , as reported hereunder)  across   the European Union, as illustrated in the map of Figure 3 below24. It is to be noted that this inventory is based  on the use of AI in public services by government agencies, which had the consequence of not gathering AI use  cases used for the public good but provided (solely) by private actors, without collaboration with government  actors. In f act, there are many exciting AI applications made available in the social domain by private  organisations – especially in public health services or transportation – which have fallen outside of the scope  of this inventory. In addition, it must be stressed that the current inventory is by no means a representative  sample of the current use of AI in government due to biased data collection methods to obtain the current  inventory.     FIGURE 3 MAPPING THE USE OF AI IN PUBLIC SERVICE S ACR OSS EUROPE                                               24 The scope of our analysis are the countries who are part of the AI Coordinated Action Plan for Europe, which includes all EU Member  States, Norway and Switzerland. In this first round of mappi ng information were gathered for all 28 EU Member States as of 2019 (including  UK which was still part of the EU ), as well as Norway and Switzerland.    
  19   Rather than sticking to any ‘ontological ’ definition of public sector organisations, the team relied on the COFOG  functional classification  of government originally developed by the OECD in 1999 and published  by the United  Nations25, now fairly w ell established in statistical research. This focuses on a ‘business oriented ’ definition of  activities of public relevance and therefore (although only in few cases, such as in  healthcare) leaves room for  the inclusion of a limited number of entities that  are not actually governed by public law. This aspect should be  borne in mind when discussing the evidence that follows.   The initial exploratory mapping  was based on a high level review of the main policy and strateg ic documents   of all European countries , complemented by a grey literature search including consultancy reports , datasets  and  other practitioner -generated information on AI use in public administration found on public websites  such as  the European AI Alliance Forum and similar . The preliminary li st of initiatives identified in this way have been  further complemented with  additional cases sent to the AI Watch team by Member State representatives, which  served  both as a validation instrument  for the initial  mapping  as well as  instrumental  to provid e additional  cases that may had been overlooked in the first phase of the research .  Whereas a considerable number of initiatives ha ve been identified in most E uropean  countries, the  approach  followed did not lead to a full y representative  geographical cover age yet. This should not be considered as  evidence of relative lack of projects in either country. Instead, it is quite likely that our  approach with its inherent  limitations has globally  underreport ed the number of existing projects on location . Crucial l imitations include:  translation  issues , for the documents not available in English language; defini tion issues , whenever the  consulted source did not use the term ‘AI’ or similar terms , but more generic expressions like data science , or  too broad definitions of involved technologies26 to characterise their initiatives; and coverage  issues , as there  was no guarantee that the list of project s provided in each government report was  comprehensive  enough or  not too constrain ed in terms of i nformation availability .  Finally, it should be noted that several AI initiatives featured to be part of this census  were in a quite early  stage of maturity, such as at  proof of concept stage or in a pilot testing phase, with comparatively fewer  examples of  full steam i mplementation and mainstream adoption . As our survey  aimed to isolate a majority of  cases of  effective AI use , some initiativ es that were too immature were  excluded from  this mapping .  Still, it is also possible that some other initiatives  retained to be part of the census and mentioned as running  at the time may have been later discontinued for various reasons , which will require more in-depth  analysis in the future.  We have noticed that throughout our research activities, some implementations of AI  have received significant public outcry, political disapproval or court orders  forcing its discontinuation , thus  highlighting the complexities of adopting and achieving (p ositive) impact through AI technologies as a result.   Despite all the above limitations, the mapping exercise conducted provides a very rich preliminary overview  of interesting cases to landscape the use of AI in public services in EU countries  as will also  be  demonstrated in the illustrative analysis presented below. This overview will be further complemented with a  more structured review and, in the next phase of our research, through the engagement of Member States,  various governmental actors and relevan t stakeholders , we expect to increase the current number of 2 30 and  reach in particular AI initiatives at local and municipal level that we believe are widespread in the EU territory.   2.2.1  AI location at country level across Europe   The following Table 2 shows the distribution of surveyed initiatives across the various EU Member States and  Associated Countries  surveyed . What can be noted here is  the lack of correlation between country size  in  terms of population/GDP and the number of surveyed initiatives : Portugal and The Netherlands hold 8% of  total case studies each, followed at short distance by Denmark with 7% and then Estonia with 6%. The first  larger si zed count ries in the ranking are France and Spain, both with 5% of the collected initiatives represented.    Therefore, the current inventory is by no means a representative picture of the current state of AI usage in the  public sector, but should be perceiv ed merely as illustrative  and as a starting point for future research.                                                  25 Presented in detail at: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Family/Detail/4    26 For instance, as all spam filters of email clients  use some form of machine learning, and such email clients are quite popular in the EU  public sector,  considering these as examples of AI initiative would have distorted the survey results .

  22   Based on the evidence gathered , we conclude  that a majority of EU Member and Associated States are indeed  using AI already in a good number of cases within their daily operations, across a variety of government  functions involved . As indicated earlier, however , this analysis is not fully representative of the current  European  scenario of public administration , due to national cases  that may be missing because of limitations  in data  gathering  or source availability or breadth of the technology definitions  adopted . It is, therefore , likely that some  underrepresented  countries do have already more numerous AI technolog ies in use or at least some  proofs of  concept under evaluation  but were overlooked in this preliminary analysis. Their position will be re-evaluated in  the next stage o f the research , in view of developing a more comprehensive overview of the use of AI in public  services in the EU, which will benefit of more direct interaction with Member States and representatives of  relevant stakeholders at na tional level involved in the peer learning process (see §1.3).  However, we believe that with all its defects, this preliminary census is an illustrative sampling of AI  initiatives currently in action in Europe , and in a few instances also across the countr y borders. In fact,  Slovenia, Spain and Sweden give evidence of a 2% of cases showing some form of a multi -national exploration  or adoption of AI solutions, often related to a funded research or innovation project being active in multiple  locations.   2.2.2  AI typology  and purpose  in public services   In order to assess what typology  of AI – and for what purpose – is being used in the surveyed countries, a  tentative classification was adopted to group the different use cases, which has been presented in  Table 1 of  §2.1 that precedes. The following text provides a more elaborated description of the ten ‘AI typologie s’ shown  therein.    Audio Processing: These AI applications are capable of detecting and recognizing sound, music and other  audio inputs, including speech, thus enabling the recognition of voices and transcription of spoken words.    Chatbots, Intelligent Digital Assistants, Virtual Agents and R ecommendation Systems : This AI  typology  include s virtualised assistants or online ‘bots’ currently used in CRM environments, both in the  private and the public sectors, not only to provide generic advice but also behaviour related  recommendations to users.    Cognitive Robotics,  Process Automation and  Connected and Automated Vehicles: The commo n  trait of these AI technologies is process automation, which can be achieved through robotized hardware  (such as prostatic limbs or precision surgery equipment) or software (either following rule -based, machine learning or mixed approaches). We have also included here the use of unmanned vehicles to deliver  services (e.g. for independent mobility of disabled people).    Computer Vision and Identity Recognition:  AI applications from this category  use some form of image,  video or facial recognition to gain info rmation on the external environment and/or the identity of specific  persons or objects.     Expert and Rule based Systems, Algorithmic Decision Making:  The reason why these apparently  distant AI developments are joined in to a single application is their preva lent orientation to facilitate or  fully automa te decision making processes of potential relevance not only to the private but also to the  public sector.    AI-empowered Knowledge Management: The common element here is the underlying capacity  of  embedded AI to create a searchable collection of case descriptions , texts and other insights to be shared  with experts for further analysis .    Machine Learning, Deep Learning:  While almost all the other categories of AI use some form of Machine  Learning, this residual category refers to AI solutions which  are not suitable for the other classifications.    Natural Language Processing, Text Mining and Speech Analytics:  These AI applications are capable  of recognising and analysing speech, written text and communicate back.    Predictive Analytics, Simulation and Data Visualisation : These AI solutions learn from large datasets  to identify patterns in the data that are consequently used to visualise, simulate or pred ict new  configurations.    Security Analytics and Threat Intellig ence: These refer to AI systems which are tasked with analysing  and monitoring security information and to prevent or detect malicious activities.  
  23   The results of this mapping are displayed in the following  Figure 4.        FIGURE 4 DISTRIBUTION OF SUR VEYED INITIATIVES AC ROSS AI TYPOLOGIES     As shown in the Figure 4, the two single classes more frequently appearing in the census are live interaction  with the ‘clients ’ of public administration – for the provision of online support through chatbot s and the  like – and the exploitation of available data by means of visualisation, simulation and predictive  tools , however relatively disjoin t from the immediate support to decision making: for instance, aimed at  drawing scenarios that improve human understanding of complex, societal or organisational, issues.   Respectively, these two ‘AI typ ologies’ occur in 2 3% (52) and 16% (37) of surveyed c ases. Then at some  distance, follow two more classes: the Expert and Rule Based systems, facilitating Algorithmic Decision Making   (13%, 29 of cases ) – a complement to the previous one – and the use of computer vision (13% , 29 of cases) .  It is also quite interesting to note which COFOG functions the above AI typologies are mostly concentrated  in,  as shown in the following Table 4.     1137191729291652812 0 10 20 30 40 50 60Security Analytics and Threat IntelligencePredictive Analytics, Simulation and Data VisualisationNatural Language Processing, Text Mining and Speech AnalyticsMachine Learning, Deep LearningExpert and Rule based Systems, Algorithmic Decision MakingComputer Vision and Identity RecognitionCognitive Robotics and Process Automation, Connected and Automated VehiclesChatbots, Intelligent Digital Assistants, Virtual Agents and Recommendation SystemsAudio ProcessingAI-empowered Knowledge ManagementAI TYPOLOGIES

Other noteworthy combinations are  the use of Computer Vision and Predictive Analytics in the Economic Affairs Domain, both with 9 cases.   More generally, this data collection exercise does suggest the existence of differences between Member  States i n the amount and typology of AI used within their countries . However, d ue to the   aforementioned methodological  limitations, it is too early to say what may cause th ose differences , but with  the progress of AI Watch activities, and a more reliable and encom passing dataset, there will  be room for deeper  inspection and drawing more stable  conclusions in that regard too . 
  25   With regard to  the purpose of AI up-take , we adopted the classification developed in a recent study by  (Engstrom  et al., 2020)  on the use of AI within the Federal Government of the USA, which classifies it according  to five categories of governmental tasks :   Enforcement : These use cases of AI relate to the enforcement of existing regulation, such as those  that identify or prioritize targets which require enforcement or inspections.    Regulatory research, analysis and monitoring : This category refers to AI use cases which assist  in the policy making processes, such as collecting, monitoring and analysing data  to augment policy makers decision -making capabilities and make them more evidence based.    Adjudication:  These AI systems are used in order to assist or conduct the granting of benefits or the  entitlement of rights to citizens.    Public services and engagem ent: These AI solutions include those that  are used to support the  provision of services to the citizens and businesses or to facilitate communication with and  participation of the general public are part of this category.    Internal management : These AI us e cases are used to assist in the management of the internal  organisation, such as human resources, procurement, ICT systems or other utilities.     Naturally, some AI technology could be used for more than one purpose and so the above categories are very  likely to overlap in practice. However, their headcount does allow a better understanding of the purposes for  which European government bodies and agencies are currently using AI. In fact, some people are worried about  the risk that the AI substitutes for th e human decision maker at all in some delicate g overnment activities such  as granting of social benefits to  people in need.   However, as show n in Figure 5 , only in 12  (5%)  cases AI was used for this purpose. Possibly,  many government agencies themselves w orry  about delegating this discretion to AI systems in  full and therefore prefer to see further maturing  of this kind of technological solutions before  undertaking such commitment.    Instead , most of the AI systems identified are  used to assist the human decision maker in the  provision of public services or engagement  building activities  (87 out of 230 cases , 38% ).  Here one could retrieve, for example, the use of  chatbots and recommend ers already outlined  above, or the delivery of matchmaking services  to facilitate e.g. unemployed persons to find  more fitting jobs, or the provision of  transcriptions of political hearings for people  with hearing difficulties. Other AI solutions  (in 47  out of 230 cases , 20% ) are used to assist public administration s in the enforcement of existing regulation or  to prioritize targets requiring policy attention , mostly to detect fraud, monitor social media behaviours or for  example detect ing the plate numbers  of irregularly parked cars.   AI systems are also well suitable to improve the internal management and operations of  government agencies , which many are currently exploring. In 45 out of 230 cases  (20%) , such systems are  used to assist internal management processes, gain insight in H uman Resources (H R) data, optimise utilities  such as for energy consumption, or support the users in the search of digitalised documents and maps, such as  in the Swedish Land Registry case. There, an AI system is also capable of  reading older, handwritten documents  and transforming them into a digital format.   Furthermore, AI systems are used in order to assist the civil servants engaged in the collection and visualisation  of data from many existing sources  (39 out of 230 cases , 17%). This support can enable the policy makers to  draft new policies which are more based on evidence or the new insights gathered within the data. As an  example, the municipality of Tallinn is using AI -powered computer cameras in order to recognise which  kind of FIGURE 5 PURPOSE OF AI IN PUB LIC SERVICES   
  26   and how many vehicles are travelling on the road. This data and the resulting scenario description would then  be used to enable better decisions regarding the city transport planning.   Finally, as already mentioned, based on our inventory, only 12  out of the 230 (5%)  AI cases are used for  the granting of benefits or similar rights to citizens or businesses . One of these is the Electronic  Declaration System in Latvia, which uses AI in order to verify submitted declarations automatically, freeing up  time for civil staff to devote to declarations that are non -compliant. Another example is  a use case in Warsaw  which automatically assigns children to nurseries based on data referring to their parents.   2.2.3  AI by policy s ector   In addition  to what was already mentioned in Table 3 of §2.2.1 it is worth narrowing the focus on the  relationship between the COFOG functions and the five categories proposed in the st udy by Engstrom et al.,  2020. This can be done with the help of the following Table  5.   TABLE 5 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE IN GOVERNMENT. P OLICY SECTOR OF SURV EYED INITIATIVES   COFOG  Categories  GPS SP DEF POS EA EP HCA HLT RCR EDU Total   Adjudication  4 1  3 1   1  2 12  Enforcement  4 4 1 14 8 1 3 11 1  47  Internal  management  20  2 5 6 1 7 2 1 1 45  Public  Services and  engagement  44 6   12  1 21 1 2 87  Regulatory  research,  analysis and  monitoring  4 3 1 5 13 1 3 6 1 2 39  Total  76 14 4 27 40 3 14 41 4 7 230    Considering  the governmental tasks in association with the COFOG taxonomy also makes sense in light of the  ongoing work of coordinated by DIGIT with Member States and experts, for the definition of a full categorisation  of public services , which is preparatory to the release of a European taxonomy of public services .27 This  helps keep some distance from the often too abstract COFOG functions in relation with the need to reduce the  level of ambiguity regarding certain policy sectors.    One of these is Health , which include both the activity of robotized precision surgery and the management of  e.g. past diagnostic and X -ray evidence as guideline for future prescriptions. While the former use case can  hardly be adjusted in a narrow defin ition of public service, the latter comfortably does. For instance, after the  outburst of the Covid -19 crisis , the Polish government has developed a Home Quarantine app to check the  health status of citizens without the need for police and medical staff to  conduct such inspections manually.  This activity and the related AI support can easily fall within the Enforcement typology introduced in §2.2.2 .  As it can be noted, 19% of AI use cases  (44 out of 230) fall at the crossroad between Public Services  and Eng agement within the General Public Services domain . This includes services from executive  bodies ,  legislative organs, financial and fiscal affairs, R&D related to general public services as well as transfers                                              27 See https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/news/2019 -09/ISA2_ European%20taxonomy%20for%20public%20services.pdf   
  27   between different levels of governments, among others. Some of these are supported by AI systems , which  assist citizens in finding out the correct information on government websites.   Quite interestingly, another 9% (20 out of 230 cases) can be referred to  the internal use of AI to deliver those  services in the different public administration bodies and agencies . With the same incidence, 9% and 21 cases,  it is interesting to note that the same cluster of governmental tasks with reference to Public Services and  Engagement is also represented in the Health domain.   Other use cases  follow  in the Economic Affairs domain , which includes general economic, agriculture, energy,  manufacturing and other services related to stimulating the economy. The prevailing AI sup ported activities  are still related to supporting, regulating or monitoring some part of the economy by the public  administration  (5,5% and 13 cases) , although AI could also be used to stimulate economic activity within the  country, by e.g. easing the proc ess of setting up a business. This is part of the cluster including, once again,  cases referring to Public Service delivery and citizen/business Engagement (5% and 12 in number).     2.2.4  AI innovation p otential  in the public sector   AI is often mentioned to be capable of transforming the fabric of our economy and society, which government  is part of. However, as the earlier literature review on eGovernment done in  §2.1has highlighted, despite the  disruptive potential of new technologies, ICT -enabled innovations are often solely incremental, changing only  the processes which can easily be adjusted. Radical innovations have not happened so far, as they require large  scale public management reforms frequently impossible to conduct.   With respect to the gathered AI i nitiatives in our inventory, an overview of their innovative potential could be  done with the help of the following definitions (adapted from Misuraca 2012, and Misuraca & Viscusi, 2015) .   Technical/Incremental Change : Including AI in public services without a clear follow -up in organisational  processes, for example the use of predictive analytics without any accompanying action or of chatbots with   limited functionalities.    Sustained/ Organisation al Change : Occurring whenever AI manages to alter existing organisation al  practices, changing organisation al processes and/or tasks of government staff, such as when robotic  process automation is used handle large requests, freeing up time for other tasks.    Disruptive/Transformative Change : Associated to new models of public service delivery that could not  be possible without AI technologies, such as the pre -emptive social protection services or the use of  chatbots with advanced functionalities for citizens.    Radical/Transformative Change : Occurring whenever AI enables large scale changes in existing policy  and governance practices, reforms of policy and service creation models, inter -organisation al reforms etc.     The following Table  6 associates the above definitions of innovative potential to the 10 ‘AI typ ologie s’  introduced in Table 1 of §2.1.  As it can be seen, more than a half of the AI solutions currently in use  (127 out of 230) bring only incremental  or technical changes to the government body or agency adopting them . Among these, chatbots and predictive  analytics confirm their primacy in E uropean public administration. The second cluster, including 58 out of 230  cases, and third cluster, with 42 cases, taken together almost equalize the number of instances in the first  group. This is encouraging, as one is about sustained and organisation al changes while the other group concerns  the disruptive and transformative changes in the organisation. What emerges with utmost clarity is that the  radical and transformative changes induced by the adoption of AI are far less common .   In addition, it is im portant to consider that the most disruptive innovations are often under scrutiny or criticism,  as citizens might not always appreciate the pro -active service delivery style of their governments, for instance  due to serious privacy concerns. A long term st udy therefore, might show that some of the disruptive usages  of AI might be cancelled, halted or reversed by new regulations, restricting the amount of disruptive cases of  AI in government.

  30   The countries with the broadest orientation towards technical and incremental change are currently Portugal  and Denmark. That with the biggest focus on sustained and incremental change is The Netherlands. Finally , the  two countries more aligned with the co ncept of disruptive and transformative change are Spain and Latvia.   The next and final Table 8 overviews the connections of innovation potentials with the now familiar five  categories of AI purpose proposed in the study by Engstrom et al., 2020.   TABLE 8 ARTIFICIA L INTELLIGENCE IN GO VERNMENT. GOVERNMENTAL TASKS V S INNOVATION   POTENTIAL   AI Use type  Incremental /  Technical  Change  Organisation al /  Sustained Change  Transformative /  Disruptive   Change  Transformative  / Radical   Change  Total   Adjudication  3 5 4  12  Enforcement  13 21 13  47  Internal  management  32 9 3 1 45  Public  Services and  engagement  54 12 19 2 87  Regulatory  research,  analysis and  monitoring  25 11 3  39  Total  127 58 42 3 230    To assess which use cases are associated with more innovative potentials, we notice than most adjudication or  enforcement use cases of AI could be regarded as sustained and to a very good extent, disruptive. Such evidence  can be explained because most of t he adjudication use cases in our census deal with the granting of benefits  and rights, which are commonly transformed into proactive services where no citizen has to make a request,  but the government does so automatically. This brings to a substantial shi ft in how public services are delivered,  which is made possible by the capabilities provided by AI.   Likewise, many disruptive innovations are taking place in the enforcement use cases. This because enforcement  practices can be changed significantly by the  use of satellite imagery, object recognizing cameras or other AI  solutions. Rather than only being able to enforce the rules in a handful of cases due to limitations of staff  resources, governments adopting AI technologies can reinforce existing enforceme nt practices such as checking  parked cars, and potentially also the rules to an extent that was not possible before, as documented in Section  3 with the SATIKAS system in Estonia, which is monitoring the mowing of farmers’ grasslands.   The provision of int ernal management services could also be changed significantly, especially when AI solutions  are used in combination with additional public reforms that enable a One -Stop Shop government (e.g. by having  a Chatbot capable of finding relevant information acro ss multiple agencies). Most of the AI solutions used for  research, analysis and monitoring and for internal management purposes have been classified as incremental  or technical changes.   Often, it is not clear what kind of changes, innovations or reforms a re the consequence of the use of these new  AI technologies. While commonly the use of the AI could reveal new insights, which could be acted upon, it is  not always clear if and how. There could be intervening factors such as political interests, interpreta bility and  understandability of the insights, reducing the possibilities of new policy design by the AI’s insights, etc.  
  31   Additionally, as noted by some observers28, implementing AI in any organisation, including from public  administration, certainly requir es roadmapping and a cost benefit analysis, but also an assessment of technical  feasibility and a holistic consideration of all tactical ‘make, buy or partner ’ options available. This is in part what  has been presented at the beginning of this Section, whe n discussing about the ‘maturity level ’ of the AI  initiatives in this census. To some extent, regardless of their actual implementation status, all of them were  initiated by a purposeful act or decision to explore, identify and then grasp the potential tra nsformative benefits  of AI for service delivery or policy making processes.   As we will discuss further in Section 3  and Section 5, the next stage of this research will comprise the  specification and empirical testing (on a significant number of case studies) of an original AI implementation  model including a detailed list of factors that facilitate or prevent AI implementation  (use)  in public sector  organisations. In so doing, the relative weight of each factor within the model will be assessed and a final,  streamlined and validated theory will be delivered.     2.2.5  Value driver orientation   As a final contribution to this preliminary analysis of the 230 AI initiatives in our census, we propose to reflect  on their value orientation as it can be inferred from t he reading of available descriptions of the cases.   Generally speaking, every innovation implemented by an organisation aims to achieve some kind of goal, which  is in turn based on one or more higher level value(s). At this stage, the different AI initiativ es have been assessed  for the extent to which their goals align with Performance, Inclusion and Openness  as relevant value targets.   The definitions used for these three targets are rather straightforward  and builds on Misuraca 2012 and  Misuraca & Viscusi,  2015, further elaborated also in Misuraca et al. 2017 :   Performance  can be evaluated through efficiency and effectiveness dimensions at three level of analysis,  for legal framework, services, and technology. Besides efficiency considered under an economic perspective  at service and technology level, we believe it is worth to point out the effects of efficiency at legal  framework level on administrative procedures. Turning then to effectiveness, reliability is relevant at service  level, including accuracy an d completeness of information requested for the service provision.    As for the Openness  dimensions we first considered accessibility at technological level, in terms of  diffusion of standards and technological infrastructures and systems for interoperability, and information  level as the ability of administrations to access data by means of the shared back office, and the possibility  for external users to access administrative data via, e.g., open data portals or apps. As for transparency we  are interested in service and organisation al levels in terms of the volume of information that the pub lic  administration provide to users describing their internal functioning and informing them on what they can  expect or claim while using the service. Moreover, accountability dimensions refer to legal framework and  organisation  as the levels to be conside red to evaluate the degree to which, for example, users’ opinions  and feedback influences service policies and decision -making.    Finally, Inclusion  includes accessibility dimensions for the service and technology levels (for example the  existence of differe nt channels for service access and delivery); whereas equity dimensions are considered  at organisation  and information levels to evaluate, for example, the ease of access for minority or  disadvantaged groups. It is worth noting that accessibility in this c ase relate to capabilities enabled by the  services and technologies from a welfare oriented perspective; whereas accessibility in the openness case  allows to identify how interoperable is a public administration digital initiative, thus accessibility refer s to  an administrative perspective rather than to a social one.     The next Table 9 compares the AI -enabled innovation potentials described in the previou s sub-section  with the  three aforementioned targets of value creation.                                                 28 E.g.

  32   TABLE 9 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE IN GOVERNM ENT.

In fact, 68% (157 out of 2 30) of our  initiatives pursue mainly performance -based goals, while only 21%  (49 out of 230) pursue inclusion driven  goals . This mea ns e.g. to make public services more accessible for citizens who have challenges in using the  traditional versions of them or those who do not feel at ease with an all too large amount of digital information  to be consumed. Almost paradoxically, in a mere  10% of the AI initiatives (24 out of 230), the goal of  improving the openness of government comes to the forefront , e.g. in increasing the amount of  information available for citizens and other stakeholders.   The following Figure 6 compares the policy sectors  described in the previous sub-section  with the three above  targets of value creation.      FIGURE 6 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE I N GOVERNMENT. FUNCTI ONS INVOLVED VS VALU E TARGETS     The most frequently attended COFOG functions are General Public Services, Economic Affairs, Health, Public  Order and Safety (the four of them related to Performance targets). Then we notice in relation to Inclusion, the  reiterated importance of General Public Services and the Health sector. The remaining six government functions  and residual value target (Openness) are less evident in terms of frequency of occurrences.    163555141 931164 51832129392346 G E N E R A L  P U B L I C  S E R V I C E SS O C I A L  P R O T E C T I O ND E F E N C EP U B L I C  O R D E R  A N D  S A F E T YE C O N O M I C  A F F A I R SE N V I R O N M E N T A L  P R O T E C T I O NH O U S I N G  A N D  C O M M U N I T Y  A M E N I T I E SH E A L T HR E C R E A T I O N ,  C U L T U R E  A N D  R E L I G I O NE D U C A T I O NP O L I C Y  S E C T O R  P E R  V A L U E  D R I V E R Inclusion Openness Performance
  33   We conclude the discussion by analysi ng the correlations between each of the three value targets and the 10  ‘AI typ ologies’ utilised for categorising the initiatives in our census. The results are presented in Figure  7.     FIGURE 7 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE IN GOVERNMEN T. AI TYPES VS VALUE  TARGETS   As noted while commenting previous tables, the two most significant ‘AI Typ ologies’ in relation to Performance  are Chatbots and Predictive Analytics, followed at short distance by Computer Vision and Expert and Rule based  Syste ms, always in relation to Performance. Then again Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Robotics.  The only significant correlation can be noted between Inclusion and Chatbots, again see as means to facilitate  some convergence of interests between citiz ens and public sector organisations.     2.3 Insights  from the initial s urvey  of Member States use of AI in public services   Building on the existing experiences and analysis of AI initiatives  identified  in the mapping , a survey was  designed and launched for  gathering insights from Member States in view of the Peer Learning Workshop on  AI use and impact in Public Services held in Brussels  on 11 -12 February 2020.   The survey was completed by 18 European countries , with respondents including head of departments,   CIO’s, (senior) policy officers  and consultants . In many cases, the survey was answered by a coordinated group  of experts from the Member States to ensure the most valid and recent information. See Table 10 .  The survey was structured around three main goa ls: first , to gain unique knowledge regarding the existing use  of AI in the Member States, gathering  information to enrich the ongoing mapping; second , to obtain an outlook  of the different policy initiatives Member States were planning or already executin g in order to facilitate and  boost the adoption of AI in government and, finally, to receive insights  on what  Membe r States are expecting  from AI Watch, so as to lay the foundations for future research collaborations.  13162383382 311244 85251424211016259 AI-E M P O W E R E D  K N O W L E D G E  M A N A G E M E N TA U D I O  P R O C E S S I N GC H A T B O T S ,  I N T E L L I G E N T  D I G I T A L  A S S I S T A N T S ,  V I R T U A L  A G E N T S  A N D   R E C O M M E N D A T I O N  S Y S T E M SC O G N I T I V E  R O B O T I C S  A N D  P R O C E S S  A U T O M A T I O N ,  C O N N E C T E D  A N D   A U T O M A T E D  V E H I C L E SC O M P U T E R  V I S I O N  A N D  I D E N T I T Y  R E C O G N I T I O NE X P E R T  A N D  R U L E  B A S E D  S Y S T E M S ,  A L G O R I T H M I C  D E C I S I O N  M A K I N GM A C H I N E  L E A R N I N G ,  D E E P  L E A R N I N GN A T U R A L  L A N G U A G E  P R O C E S S I N G ,  T E X T  M I N I N G  A N D  S P E E C H   A N A L Y T I C SP R E D I C T I V E  A N A L Y T I C S ,  S I M U L A T I O N  A N D  D A T A  V I S U A L I S A T I O NS E C U R I T Y  A N A L Y T I C S  A N D  T H R E A T  I N T E L L I G E N C ET Y P E  O F  A I  P E R  V A L U E  D R I V E R Inclusion Openness Performance

COU NTRIES RESPONDING  TO THE SURVEY ON AI USE   # Country   1 Czech Republic   2 Denmark   3 Estonia   4 Finland   5 France   6 Germany   7 Ireland   8 Italy  9 Latvia   10 Malta   11 The Netherlands   12 Norway   13 Portugal   14 Romania   15 Slovak Republic   16 Slovenia   17 Sweden   18 Switzerland   Here below we report a selection of key findings gathered from the Member States survey. As mentioned,  only  part of EU countries completed the survey and a more comprehensive picture is expected to be gained in the  next phase of the research, not only ensuring all EU Member States will respond to the survey and be  represented , but also deepening the analys is with in -depth reviews at country level.   However, already from this preliminary analysis of the survey responses some interesting trends and examples   can be identified  - though clearly they may embed a cognitive bias as they represent self -reported answ ers -  and grouped in the following areas.    Funding  and T raining;    Organisation and regulatory frameworks ;   Methodology  to assess impacts and priorities .  2.3.1  Funding  and Training   Of the respondi ng countries, 67% indicated to have  allocated funding to stimulate the development  and the adoption of AI for use within the  government.  Many countries highlight ed the  availability of resources between 5 and 10 million  euros, although there were some with more. Both  France and Denmark mention ed they had funding  available between 50 and 100 million euros . See  Figure 8 .          One example of large funding programme in  France  is the Public Action Transformation  Fund  (FTAP -Fonds de transformation de l'action  publique). This is a funding programme amounting  to a total of 700 million euros for the  transformation of public agencies and 13 AI  projects have been already funded since 2018.   Yes 67%No 22%Don't  know 11% Yes  No  Don't know FIGURE 8 AI FUNDING IN MEMBE R STATES  
  35   This information should however be further investigated and contrasted with the estimat e of investments in AI  (in both public and private sectors) that each Member State is outlining as part of the ir own  National AI  strategies, and which is a specific focus of the AI Watch.29 Nevertheless , the specific focus of this research  activity on the use of AI in public services will also require a ‘deep dive ’ in the amount of financial resources  that public administration s and governmental agencies at different levels have at their disposal to impl ement  AI initiatives and make the use of AI effective and mainstream.   Strictly connected to the funding on AI is the availability of specific training in AI related topics , such as  data analytics, machine learning and automated decision making among others . The capacity to manage AI  techniques and understand their implications on policy and governance mechanisms is in fact crucial for the  successful adoption and uptake of innovative solutions. See Figure 9 .  In this respect, of the 18 countri es responding t o the survey, 7  (39%)   highlighted having internal AI training programmes for civil servants,  whereas 11 countries (56%) mention ed they did not have any specific  training programme  on AI  in place . All countries with a training  programme report ed having less than half  million euros available for the  training programmes. In many cases, the Finnish  free online course the  Elements of AI  is often mentioned to be part of the training programme of  civil servants. Furthermore, some countries are planning to develop separate  courses for senior management, technical specialists and policy makers with  different training contents.                 2.3.2  Organisation and regulatory frameworks   Another aspect of central importance for effective adoption and use of AI in public services refers to the  organisational structure and processes  that public administration s and government have defined.   In this regard, m any countries (13) mention ed to have at least one  department, unit or dedicat ed team  working on stimulating the  uptake of AI in the public sector, researching the effects of AI or  preparing new AI -specific regulation s. Of these 13 countries, 9  reported  to have more than one of these units. Some of these  teams ar e relatively new (st arted in 2018 or 2019), while others  are more established teams who were previously tasked with I CT  regulation such as existing I T bodies or specific department s for  emerging technologies.     In terms of financial frameworks to manage AI development and  uptake, 3 countries reported having defined specific guidelines  or principles  for the procurement of AI in the public sector .  These procurement g uidelines aim to either stimulate the  development of ethical and trustworthy AI in both the public and  the private sector , or to provid e civil servants with the necessary  expertise to ensure that common issues while dealing with in AI  procurement can be avoided.                                                29. See https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch/topic/ai -landscape -indicators_en   The Elements of AI  is a free online course already used  in many countries and now being translated by Finland ,  with the support of the European Commission  in all EU  languages. The course teaches the basics of Artificial  Intelligence to a broad audience. At the moment, it is  already available in English, Finnish, Swedis h and  Estonian. Over 370.00 people have already signed up for  the course, with 40% of the participants  being female.   39% 56%5% Yes No Don't know For example, in The Netherlands , the  Ministry of Justice and Safety now has a  number of people working in the Justice  and Law Enforcement department  tasked on focusing on AI. In Finland, there  is a new Expert Group on New  Technologies since 2019 which are  tasked in exploring the implications of AI.  FIGURE 9 AI TRAINING IN MEMB ER STATES   Malta , for example, is  developing a  business template for the procurement  of emerging technologies ( including AI)  and will enact a training and  awareness programme for civil  servants in order to equip them with  the required AI -related skills . 
  36   In this respect Norway mentioned that the AI they were using was made possible through  new innovative publi c  procurement services. In addition, the procurement processes themselves could be amplified using  AI  technologies, making the process more inclusive, accessible, fast er and robust.   Another policy action that is emerging as a key element to enable  adoption and use of AI is the implementation of regulatory  sandboxes  to test AI solutions in a safe setting, before they are  deployed in society at large.   Based on the replies of the survey, 7 (39%) countries indicate to  have some form of a regulatory sandbox in place. Commonly, these  sandboxes aim to do a quality assessment of AI (e.g. for healthcare  or security and policing applications) to gain a better confidence in  the performance and ca pabilities of the AI solutions.  See Figure 10 .  Furthermore, 9 countries indicated to have an ethical framework   to act as a guidin g set of principles for the development and usage  of AI within the public sector. However, of those that at the moment  do not have such a framework, 7 respondents mention ed that their  government aim ed to develop such an ethical framework in the near  future .       Finally, none of the respondents mention ed that their government  had published an AI law  which regulates the use of AI in the public  sector in the last 5 years. However, many (10 ) respondents  highlight ed that some new regulation would be implem ented shortly  or was currently under review or consultation. Most  of them , in fact,  indicate d that a specific ‘AI-law’ was not planned but rather existing  laws (e.g. on Data Protection / Data Sharing) might be revised  whenever this was regarded as necessary. In the next stage of the  AI Watch research, an analysis  will be conducted on a case by case  basis, to determine whether the introduction of new technologies  really require s significant changes to existing legislation.     2.3.3  Impacts assessment and priorit ies  The final section of the Survey aimed to gain practical knowledge and information on methodological aspects  and approaches used by Member States to analyse and assess use and impact of AI in public services, so to  identify possible complementarities and sy nergies with the AI Watch research in the public sector.   In this regard, 9 countries indicated having  already completed or  being conducting landscaping s tudies on the use of AI in the public  sector and in publi c services in order to get  an overview of what kind  of AI is being  used within their own administration s. Existing AI cases  currently in pilot status or already in use have been shared with the  AI Wa tch research team and some of these examples will be  discussed further in this report  (see Section 3).   A number of countries also shared information on the fact th at they  already had or were in the progress of developing a methodology to  assess the impact of AI solutions : either by using existing impact  assessment  framework s and indicators as commonly done in all pilot projects, or by following a new approach  more specifically suited for AI , somehow relat ed to their national strategy .   In order to assist in the prioritization of public services to focus on  in future research activities ( through  e.g. in-depth case studies , thematic analyses and impact assessment ), respondents were asked to sugge st  which policy domains were regarded as priority in their country for AI . For this, a five point scale was used from  very low importance  to very high importance.  For instance, in Norway , a selected area in  the country has been dedic ated to the safe  testing of autonomous vehicles and vessels.   In Estonia , for example, af ter a  thorough review of the  existing  regula tory framework, the majority  of laws wa s considered technology  neutral enough, so  that there was no  need for fundament al changes or  the adoption of a specific  AI law.   In Sweden , the government developed a  framework to measure potential effects  and value of AI , as well as collect  and  document use cases so as to scale -up local  initiatives at a national and/or E uropean  level. Collaboration with AI Watch initiated  as part of the peer learning and knowledge  exchange process with and across other  Member States of the EU.   39% 50%11% Yes No I don't know FIGURE 10 REGULATORY SANDBOXE S 
  37       As shown in Figure 11, respondents stated the following preferences for priority public services in the following  policy domains:30   Healt h (4.6/5 level of importance)    Education  (4.4/5 level of importance)    Public Order and Safety  (4.1/5 level of importance)    Defence and Environmental Protection  (4/5 level of importance)    Transport and Agriculture , as a specific subdomain of the Economic Affairs  policy domain.     Finally , the survey asked  respondents to express their expectation s on what AI Watch could contribute   and whether there was interest in cooperating with the European Commission’s Knowledge Service managed  by JRC and C ONNECT. B ased on the responses collected the AI Watch should  act mainly as a platform  to share  existing use cases across the EU. This should allow Member States to learn from each other, exchange   experiences, applications and best practices with regard to the use of AI in the public sector.   The publication of studies, guidelines, peer -learning and capacity building may serve as a mechanism  to share  expertise and knowledge across Europe. Complementing this, the respondents also expressed interest in  gaining  comparative o verviews of the state of the use of AI in the public sector , so as to better understand their own  strengths and weaknesses. Such a comp arison, however, should be based on practical and useful benchmarking  tools to assist policy makers.                                               30.

  38   Lastly, many respon dents highlight ed the need  to define jointly what is truly meant by AI in the  public sector, as many independent observers  are currently strug gling with the  operationalization of the term  (see also §2.1  above) . The AI Watch therefore should provide  the first steps to a better, coherent  understanding of what is to be considered AI in   the public sector (and what is not).   In summary, while there is a general excitement  about what AI can do to help governments m ove  forward, and AI optimists  believe that, in support  of the right policies and  if deployed with care, it  can bring about better outcomes for everyone,  there are also many challenges and grey areas   which require attention an d further research to  better map the reality of use and impact of AI in  public services, especially when it comes to  setting up policy and service experimentations  and transparent solutions, appropriately  communicated to the citizens .   Globally , there is still limited  understanding on how to harness the power of AI  and how to ensure  sustainability, fairness, control of information asymmetry and risk of failure in these environments. Along this   line, to better understand the potential of AI to su pport the digital transformation of government, AI deserves  an extensive assessment in the realm of public administration operations and related public service  provision  (see more on this in Section 5 ). Literature  and practice in the field show in fact that even when the  latest technologies are introduced , critical barriers  encountered in the eGovernment experience  are still present  and m uch of the research on AI often focuses solely on technology, failing  to take into consideration the  complexity of imp lementation within public administration.  Insufficient consideration of the complex   interactions between humans, institutions, politics and AI technologies may lead to overambitious statements  of AI’s pot ential not reflected in reality.   This is particularl y relevant in light of the COVID -19 pandemic crisis , where many governments have been  stimulating the development and adoption of AI technologies to tackle various aspects of the spread of the  contagion . Some highlight the possibilities of AI technologies for developing medical applications to fight the  virus (Bullock et al., 2020; Wang & Tang, 2020) , while others notice the use of  AI applications to monitor and  enforce social distancing protocols (Naudé, 2020) .   Although, at the moment of writing, the adoption and active use of AI technologies by government agencies to  tackle the spread of the virus has been limited, wit h applications available being mainly Chatbots to provide  information regarding health situation and safety guidelines, most of the applications are still under testing or  initial adoption , leaving little room for studying the achieved effects of their implementation  for the time being .   However, the curr ent inventory does include a few AI use cases in Europe, such as the plans to use AI to assist  in monitoring the beach capacity in Fuengirola, Southern Spain or an app developed in Poland which uses facial  recognition to assist enforcement of quarantine ru les. Nevertheless , preliminary findings  let emerged the  warning  that too much  trust and hope is placed in AI  technologies to solve the crisis, which effectiveness may  be heavily reduced if not combined with ‘traditional’ policy responses such as improved t esting capabilities.31  Careful assessment of these AI -driven solutions is therefore advisable, as to avoid situations where surveillance  and monitoring of citizens is increased without substantial value for citizens in coping with the pandemic crisis   (Kitchin, 2020) .                                                 31 For example, Natalie Kofler & Françoise Baylis argue there are still too many practical issues limiting the  effectiveness of any technological solution: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586 -020-01451 -0, while Evgeny Morozov  argues that widespread intentions to use surveillance technologies might do more harm than good  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ 2020/apr/15/tech -coronavirus -surveilance -state -digital -disrupt   FIGURE 12 WORDCLOUD OF EXPECT ATIONS FOR AI WATCH  
  39   3 Use of AI in public services in the EU   3.1 Approach to case studies  prioritisation and selection   As anticipated in the previous Section , notwithstanding its limitations, the preliminary exploratory mapping  conducted has allowed us to gather a unique inventory of initiatives of AI across Europe . In fact,  information on the use of AI in government and public services is not easy to find and collect, especially  considering the nascent stage of development and the widespread scope of the investigation.   As already mentioned , not all initiatives claimed to be  of AI implementation are actually so. Quite the contrary,  often some cases do not go beyond the pilot or testing phase. For this reason, the review took into careful  consideration the context in which AI -enabled services are being implemented or planned, as t he aim of the  analysis was to provide an overview of the state of the art and a prospective view, rather than an assessment.   Thus, th e inventory built incrementally  over the course of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 (now including about  400 initiatives alt ogether) has been screened and streamlined . For example, many pure research projects solely  attempt ing to develop AI solutions, mainly based on machine learning models, without any prospective use in  public services , have been excluded from the initial inventory. Similarly, all claimed AI initiatives for which it  was not clear if they had ever been used or were still in operation , were also removed. This resulted into the  selection of 2 30 initiatives that form ed the s ample f or the analysis in Section 2 .  Out of this sample, we went more in depth to identify the effective use in public service , so to discriminate  what is not yet mature enough from what is instead ‘happening ’. Using the current COVID19 crisis as an analog y,  we are not interested in solutions that cannot be immediately implemented, rather in AI-enabled services that  are proving to be effective, or – at another extreme  – generating e.g. social or ethical concerns while they are  impact ing – sometimes disrupti vely and perhaps even radically  - the way government operate s.   For this purpose, we defined an approach for selecting case studies and priority services to focus on , which is  represented in the Figure 13 below .     FIGURE 13 APPROACH FOR PRIORIT ISATION AND SELECTIO N OF CASE STUDIES     The figure shows the two main dimensions used for identifying the use cases as axes of a (x,y) plan : these are:    The ‘relevance ’ of the use cases. This means that we are only interested in studying the use of AI in  connection with government operations and public services delivery .   The ‘diversity ’ of the use cases . This refers to a diverse set of AI technologies used in government  and for public services provision.   
  40   The illustrative use cases of AI in government and public services  have been selected out of a shortlist  of initiatives lying on the top right corner of the (x,y) plan, i .e. meeting a number of criteria ensuring diversity  of the AI technology types and relevance  of the purpose of use. These two criteria have been complemented by  a certain degree of representativeness of the European landscape.   However as the figure shows,  use cases holding similar traits can be clustered by proximity. This has two  advantages: 1) avoiding duplication of efforts in commenting all too close initiatives, and 2) identify ing  ‘representative ’ cases  for each cluster, which  we will further analyse through in -depth case study analys es and  focus groups, involving the responsible authorities and other relevant stakeholders at national and local level .  The main assumptions underlying the approach are that the AI typologies and the policy sector s represent  the  first mapping criteria, while the purpose of the AI use for different public services defin e the value drivers for  indicating the potential policy impact.  At the same time, the in depth analysis of case studies will serve to pave  the way for a defin ition of  the key drivers and success factors for overcoming barriers to AI use in public  services, as element of a roadmap and guidelines to support AI strategic enablement in the public sector in  Europe.   As a first step in this direction, in the following sub -section  (§3.2) we describe  a set of cases as illustrative  examples of the landscape of AI use in public services. Each illustrative  case has been assessed qualitatively  based on a number of questions, such as : Which use cases are most relevan t for the different policy s ector s  identified? W hat are the typologies of AI used ? What are the i nnovation types?  Which drivers and AI purposes  can be identified  in particular ?  This exercise is  also preliminary to identify the requirements required for building the modelling approach and  estimating social and economic impacts according to a public value perspective, as indicated in Section 5 .     3.2 Illustrative cases  of AI use in public services   In Table 11, we provide an  overview of the eight (8) selected illustrative cases of AI use in public  services , summarizing the AI typologies, the policy sectors, the enablers and the expected impact s they may  generate .   While these examples are not representative of all the possible types of use in public services, they do reveal  the variety of AI currently being developed within the public sector, as well as the diffe rent purposes, challenges  and consequences of their usage.   As illustrated earlier, these AI systems have been regarded to be diverse in their innovation potential. Some of  these AI systems bring incremental changes to the public service delivery, while ot hers aim to have much more  disruptive changes, by redesigning existing work practices, sometimes enabling new forms of public service  delivery which would not have been possible without the AI implementation.   At the same time, some of the more radical cas es of AI -enabled innovation raise concerns and fears from  citizens and regulators, as they may redefine the power relations within the governance arena and bring new  risk unbalances in the democratic settings of European societies.   Among the cases describ ed, in fact, we have also chosen to include some controversial cases of AI use, which  have been halted or are under judicial scrutiny, due to ethical, legal and social concerns. These cases highlight  that the introduction and use of AI systems in public sector organisation s and environments is not as  straightforward as the technological requirements alone might sugges t. The perception of citizens and civil  servants using these AI -technologies is to be considered a crucial element for the sustainable use and   implementation of AI in public services and policies .

  42   The cases selected are further described in more detail  below , discussing the specific features and elements of  interest with regard to their use and potential impact.   3.2.1  SATIKAS, Estonia   Country  Estonia   AI typology  Computer Vision and Identity Recognition   Level of administration  Central   Policy Sector  Economic Affairs   Purpose  Enforcement   Main enablers  Satellite data, resource/data sharing, funding, trust   (Expected) Impact  Improved administration and resource use, improved subsidy  compliance by farmers   In the Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board (ARIB), AI is used in order to detect wh ether  the agricultural grasslands have been mowed or not using image recognition . This system, called  SATIKAS32, uses deep learning methods and convolutional neural network approaches to analyse the satellite  data coming from the European COPERNICUS programme to automatically detect whether mowing has taken  place on the Estonian grasslands. The optical satellite im ages from Sentinel 1 and 2 are analysed together with  reference data of farmer fields, historical inspection logs and meteorological data from the Estonian Weather  Service. This AI system is now regarded as one of the first AI applications used by the gove rnment in Estonia.   The mowing or grazing of the grasslands is one of the most mentioned requirements for all the different  agricultural subsidies and has one of the highest amount of non -compliances in Estonia. Naturally, not all the  fields could be inspe cted by manual labour, so in the last inspection for instance, only 5 -6% of the cases were  visited. Due to rising labour costs and regulatory requirements, an innovative solution using Artificial Intelligence  was considered to optimize the inspection capac ity and prevent farmers from missing the subsidy requirements.   While SATIKAS has been implemented since 2018 in ARIB, it originally started as a research project back in  2011 with the Observatory  of the Tartu University. The development and implementation  of the system was  funded by the European Regional Development Fund to assist the development of public services with ICT.  Various public and private actors have been working together in the development and adoption of the system  within the ARIB organisati on by sharing different data, sharing (machine learning) expertise and technological  infrastructure to store the different data sets.   Civil servants working with the AI -system see the value of the system, although many were somewhat sceptical  of the proje ct at first, fearing the creation of a Big Brother state or the disappearance of jobs. However, after  project pilots were conducted and trainings given, trust in the AI system has increased. The training had to  ensure that the staff is aware that the syste m is not 100% reliable and have to combine their existing expertise  with the recommendations of the AI. Furthermore, field inspectors have also realized that their jobs will not  disappear but have changed as a result of the system.   The SATIKAS system is still under  development  and will expand its features and capabilities in the near future.  While at the moment the system is able to detect mowing of grass, in the future it will be used  for identifying  different types of crops and trees  as well .  3.2.2  Predictive System, Belgium   Country  Belgium   AI typology  Predictive Analytics, Simulation and Data Visualisation   Level of administration  State   Policy Sector  Health   Purpose  Enforcement   Main enablers  Sharing of data/resources, high data quality, convincing staff  of value   (Expected) Impact  Improved inspection capabilities, improved welfare of children                                               32 SATIKAS stands for SATellIidi andmete KAsutamise Süsteem which translates to ‘A system that uses satellite data ’.   
  43   In 2014, the Flemish Agency for Child and Family (Kind en Gezin) developed an AI system which enables  more accurate predictions to detect day -care services which require further inspection . These  inspections enable the agencies to keep the quality of the day -care services high and to improve the wellbeing  of children. The Child and Family agency does not carry out the inspections itself  but works together with the  Regional Health Care Inspection  Unit of the Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family.   However, there is limited capacity available to conduct all the inspections. For a long period of time, there has  been an interest to figure out how to optimise t he inspection capacity. The use of data had been considered as  way to enhance existing inspection practices and optimize the scarce amount of inspectors . The predictive  system developed uses a supervised machine learning method (logistic regression and XGB oost) to analyse  various internal and external data from the Health Care Inspection  Unit. Combining the recommendations of  the predictive system with existing  staff experience and expertise enables more targeted and data -driven  interventions.   During the d evelopment  phase , the Agency worked closely together with the Data Science team of the  Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family because there was already  some  expertise in text mining  therein . In addition, a close collaboration  was established  with the Health Care Inspection Unit as they provided  the data to be used in the system. A small budget of the Child and Family Agency for IT data science projects   was used , but employees had to work on the model in their spare time as volunteers.   Now, t he system is valued by civil servants, but it was noticed that there was still a need to convince colleagues  of the value of the model. In particular, staff ha d to be convinced that the use of the model was meant to  empower them , not to replace their exper tise or control their work. In the end, the combination of showing  statistical proof of the validity of the system as well as an emphasis on supporting human workers, rather than  replacing them, further improved the acceptance and support of the public sec tor end-users.   Another  important insight from this case study is the need for public organisation s to provide continuous  maintenance of the model  and the underlying data in order to make AI  adoption permanent . The AI system  has  had constant maintenance an d improvement of the model in order to ensure its accuracy and reliability: if this  maintenance was ignored, the accuracy of the model might decrease, which would reduce trust in the mo del  and in other  future  data related projects.   3.2.3  Automated public service s in Trelleborg, Sweden   Country  Sweden   AI typology  Cognitive Robotics , Process Automation  and Connected and  Automated Vehicles   Level of administration  Local   Policy Sector  Social Protection   Purpose  Adjudication   Main enablers  Developed online services, political leadership   (Expected) Impact  Reduced waiting time, increased efficiency, improved citizen’s  experience   In the municipality of Trelleborg, AI technologies are used to automate various social assistance  decisions  since 2016. That was the first mu nicipality to use Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to handle various  applications of social assistance. At the moment, the automated decision -making  system is able to process  applications for homecare, sickness benefits, unemployment benefits and taxes and  has been regarded as a  successful example for others to follow. Various other Swedish municipalities are exploring how to implement  the Trelleborg model to gain access to the same kinds of benefits.   Previously, employees had to manually assess the applic ations received, which took considerable amounts of  time and costs. With more than 300 applications of social benefits in the municipality every month, citizens  sometimes had to wait an average of 8 days on the decision on their welfare -payments, sometimes  up to 20  days. As a result of this waiting time, citizens would frequently contact the department about their applications,  further increasing the workload of the staff. The decision to use AI to improve the process was taken to  limit  the waiting time and  also various concerns related to delayed  payment s to citizens. However , the rejected  applications are still handled by the case workers  themselves.   The automation of the welfare services was not possible until an online process  was made available  for peo ple  to submit their welfare applications to. In 2015, Trelleborg was the first Swedish municipality to digitalize the 
  44   administration of social benefits. Now a lready 75% of the citizens use the online platform to access welfare  payments , which enabled the a cquisition of significant data and information to automate this process with RPA  technology. Without the data coming from the self -service portal, it would not have been possible to automate  these processes. Valcon, a local consultancy, helped to develop a nd implement the RPA platform.   As a result of the automation process, the waiting time for citizens on their welfare applications has been  significantly reduced. It has been mentioned that in many case s the  handling times for people in economically  vulnerable situations has been reduced from 10 to 1 day, with all financial assistance decisions done within 24  hours. In addition, two employees in the Trelleborg administration have been reallocated to spend mor e time  on other, value added tasks such as handling more complex cases. An early study on the use of automation  found that there was a positive attitude from the staff towards the use of the AI -system as it made their work  more effective and brought  more l egal certainty.   Despite these positive effects, there are also concerns with the use of automation. Already at the start of the  implementation phase , many social workers were hesitant on using the system  due to fears of losing jobs or  passing sensitive so cial tasks on to computers. Other Swedish municipalities aiming to follow the automation  of Trelleborg also met  resistance from some of their local staff , some members of whom were even led  to  resign. Case reports mention the  strong need for making  the aut omation process  trustworthy . If there is no trust  in the use of AI, staff will be obliged to double check all processes, which might lead to a decrease in efficiency  and effecti veness. Furthermore, some observers express ed concerns on the risk of excluding  some more  vulnerable citizens when all processes are automated online , as this makes it  more challenging to assess  individual needs.   While the AI -system enabled various social welfare benefits decisions to be automated, many other processes  of the Trelle borg municipality still operate as in a traditional bureaucra tic system . There are still many paper based processes within the organisation which could lead to double documentation and inefficient processes,  as well as existing software with very poor inte rfaces and usability  levels . Hence. Process  Automation in general  and AI systems in particular can  strongly improve one specific government process, but the interoperability  with  other organisational processes should never be forg otten.   3.2.4  ChatBot UNA, Latvia   Country  Latvia   AI typology  Chatbots, Intelligent Digital Assistants, Virtual Agents and  Recommendation Systems   Level of administration  State   Policy Sector  Economic Affairs   Purpose  Public Services and Engagement   Main enablers  Data on frequently asked questions, consultancy assistance   (Expected) Impact  Reduced administrative burden and workload, improved public  service, improved citizen’s experience   In 2018, the Register of Ente rprises of Latvia introduced a  Chatbot to answer frequently asked questions  regarding the process of enterprise registration . The name UNA has a symbolic meaning as it stands for  Future Support of Entrepreneurs in the Latvian language. This way, UNA acts as an indicator for the future of  the Latvian public administration . Chatbots are available 24/7 and thus able to make communication between  citizens and the state more accessible and user friendly. UNA is available on both the website of the Register  of Enterprises as well as on the Facebook page and as part of the Messenger application. UNA is able to answer  frequently asked questions about the registration and liquidation of businesses, merchants, companies and  organisation s. If citizens already have an application in progress, they can also ask information about it.    UNA, which at present works only in the Latvian language , has been developed because the organisation  had  to respond to a lot of calls and emails, which were more or less the same each time. The high engagement of  organisation al resources dedicated  to answ ering the same kinds of questions could easily be lessened by using  Artificial Intelligence, especially Natural Language Processing techniques. A Latvian company, Tilde, specializing  in AI technologies cooperated in the development of UNA. The usage of a conversational agent was argued to  be highly successful and UNA has been nominated for numerous awards such as the OECD's Public Excellence,  World Summit Award and others. According to some  performance indicators, 44% of the questions asked on  UNA are consi dered to be of general nature and easily taken care of by the Chatbot. Other non -standard issues  are still handled by the support staff, but now they have more time to focus on more complex tasks . 
  45   3.2.5  Tengai, Sweden   Country  Sweden   AI typology  Cognitive Robotics , Process Automation  and Connected and  Automated Vehicles   Level of administration  Municipal   Policy Sector  General Public Services   Purpose  Internal Affairs   Main enablers  Consultancy assistance, Existing recruitment practices, culture  for innovation   (Expected) Impact  Unbiased recruitment services, higher quality personnel, lower  recruitment costs and length   The Swedish municipality of Upplands -Bro has started experimenting with the  robot Tengai in their recruitment  processes since June 2019. Tengai is one of the first interview er robots developed with the aim to make  the recruitment process less biased than traditional interview practices would do . The robot is  adopted by the recrui tment and staffing agency of the municipality, which has already made  their recruitment  processes less biased. For the last 10 years already, the  agency  have not used resumes in their recruitment  process and growingly taken an interest in data -driven recru itment tools. Consequently, having a physical robot  was regarded as the next step in preventing bias es in hiring decisions. The idea behind the use of the robot was  to avoid that a human person was present at the beginning of the recruitment process in ord er to neutralise  any psycho -social prejudices.   The Tengai robot is the result of a collaboration between  the municipality staff and the  AI consultancy Furhat  Robotics . After the Tengai robot was released, within a week, it was decided  to adopt its service s permanently .  For the company this was also a first time , the municipal recruitment and staffing agency  being their first public  sector client.   The Tengai robot is seen to complement the recruitment process  nicely,  having been  designed not to perceive  the age, gender, clothing, background or other looks of interviewed persons. The municipality is using Tengai to  first identify candidates with the highest general performance score, in order to make a shortlist for future  selecti ons. Here, Tengai works in collaboration with existing staff, as the recruiters analyse competency checks  and schedule an interview appointment with Tengai. The robot  then conducts the interviews to assess the  candidates by analysing  their behaviours , problem-solving capacities and other  skills. If needed, the robot is  able to ask follow up questions. The interviews are then analysed, combined with the competency scores . Tengai  then make s a first selection of promising candidates. The recruiters of the muni cipality will conduct the final  interview with candidates to assess their motivation.   The first results following the adoption of the Tengai robot have been regarded as successful and brought   significant media attention to the municipality due to the inno vative approach to recruitment. According to one  of the directors of the municipality, the Tengai robot has made the selection and hiring processes faster, cheaper  and more unbiased, freeing up crucial resources to be spen t on other tasks.   3.2.6  SyRi (Systeem R isico Indicatie), the Netherlands   Country  The Netherlands   AI typology  Predictive Analytics, Simulation and Data Visualisation   Level of administration  Central/ Municipal   Policy Sector  Social Protection   Purpose  Enforcement   Main enablers  Sharing of data/resources, high data quality, Political  leadership   (Expected) Impact  Improved inspection capabilities, improved welfare of children,  reduced misuse of public funds   Various municipalities in the Netherlands have been using the SyRi system  to detect welfare fraud more  effectively . SyRi has been developed by the Dutch government  and uses various risk indicators from existing  governmental systems such as taxes, health insurance, residence, education and many more , in order to detect  which addresses hold a higher risk of fraud or misuse of welfare benefits.  
  46   SyRi was developed in 2014 after multiple municipalities had been creating their own systems to detect fraud.  To enable the sharing of different information  items that are relevant  for SyRi, the syste m operates on a legal  basis which clearly indicates which kind of data can be captured , stored  and shared.   While the core aim for SyRi is to tackle welfare fraud and reduce misuse of public funding, during the  development of the system, the Dutch governmen t also mention ed that the administration costs of detecting  welfare fraud could be reduced and citizens might be more hesitant to commit fraud if they kn ow that a  governmental system is watching them. These goals are related to the more generic purposes of  Syri to improve  social safety and liveability of neighbourhoods. This is why most implementations of SyRi have been conducted  in specific, usually less developed and poorer, territorial  areas. The system does not make any decision itself,  but provides rec ommendations for civil servants to conduct further investigations.    Various organisations have opposed the usage of the system . They argue  that it cause s too many privacy  infringements and is discriminatory towards the poor and vulnerable  citizens . The la ck of transparency on the  inner working of the system and the inability of the people affected to  get to  know their data have been criticized  as well. The UN -rapporteur for Human Rights also expressed his concerns on the use of SyRi as it could be a  signif icant threat to human rights.   In addition, the actual benefits of using the system  have been disputed as well.  While several  projects in Dutch  municipalities  used the recommendations by SyRi, they did not allow to detect new case s of fraud  in the end .  Some projects revealed  significant difficulties in integrating various data  sources , which caused the  recommendations by the system to be come  outdated and in fact un usable. In municipalities where the system  actually gave recommendations on possible fraud ulent behaviour , the success rate was very low. As, the costs  of SyRi have been estimated to be over 325.000 euro per year, so that many have been wondering whether the  system was worth the privacy and financial costs  at all .    Following a court case, the Du tch court decided in early 2020 that the use of SyRi did not comply with Article 8  of the ECHR  (European Convention of Human Rights) , thus its usage has been cancelled. The judge ruled that  the collective, economic welfare interest of preventing fraud weig hed insufficiently against the social interest  of privacy. Furthermore, the absence of disclos ure about the inner working of SyRi make s its usage insufficient ly  transparent and verifiable.   3.2.7  Unemployed p rofiling , Poland   Country  Poland   AI typology  Expert and Rule Based Systems, Algorithmic Decision Making   Level of administration  Central/ Municipal   Policy Sector  Economic Affairs   Purpose  Adjudication   Main enablers  Political leadership, Available data on unemployment, drive for  modernization   (Expected) Impact  Personalized public services, reduced unemployment, improved  efficiency   As early as in 2012, the Polish Ministry of Labour and Social Policy (MLSP) started working on the reform of  340 labour offices (PUP - Powiatowe Urzędy Pracy), charged with ana lysing the trends and supporting the  development of the labour market . The urgency of the reform was underlined by a general perception of PUP s  being inefficient, understaffed and unfit to address the challenges posed by the modern labour market.   With tha t reform  in mind - and without significant public spending increases  at hand  – the MLSP has scoped  possible solutions that would ensure more efficient budget allocation. In this light, resorting to an automated  profiling system for unemployment  came  across  as a modern, cost efficient and individualized method of  service delivery.   The process of automated profiling divides unemployed persons in three categories , taking into consideration a  number of individual characteristics. Assignment to a given category determines what types of programs a  beneficiary  is eligible for ( e.g. job placement, vocational training, apprenticeship, activation allowance). The  system is based on data collected during an initial interview ( e.g.. age, gender, disability and duration o f  unemployment), and a subsequent computer -based test that scores 24 different dimensions.  Assignment to  one of the three profile groups indicates the needed level of support and resource  burden . Importantly, in one  case categorisation  translates into life -changing, binary decisions: state support or lack thereof.  
  47   However, the use of this AI system has received criticism from both within the organisation a nd outside. Firstly,  the underlying working of the AI system is opaque as citizens  are not made aware of the score received nor of  how this score has been determined. Furthermore, the  idea behind the profiling mechanism was to serve solely  as an advisory tool, while retaining a human in the loop who would have the final say on the appro priateness   of the categorisation .   Surprisingly - as a study found  out - less than 1 in 100 decisions made by the algorithm have been questioned  by the responsible clerks. Excluding a belief in the outstanding precision of the algorithm , other reasons for not  challenging automated decisions include lack of time to consider more details; fear of repercussions from  supervisors; and a presumption of  objectivity of the process - all in all rendering what was supposed to be an  advisory mechanism the ultimate dec ision-maker.   Many unemployed persons have complained through administrative courts, claiming the categorisation  to be  unjust.  The Supreme Audit Office carried out a thorough control of PUPs, only to conclude about the  ineffectiveness of the profiling syste m and its potential to lead to discrimination. Finally, the Human Rights  Commissioner filed a formal complaint to the Constitutional Tribunal over a procedural issue, and the latter  ruled that the profiling tool was  unconstitutional. As of June 14th 2019, the system  has been officially  dismantl ed by the governme nt.  3.2.8  VeriPol, Spain   Country  Spain   AI typology  Cognitive Robotics , Process Automation  and Connected and  Automated Vehicles   Level of administration  Central / Local   Policy Sector  Public Order & Safety   Purpose  Enforcement   Main enablers  Collaboration with university, corpus of digital reports,  integration into existing information system   (Expected) Impact  Higher detection of false reports, higher productivity, reduced  submission of fraudulent reports   The filing of fake police reports is quite common in Spain, especially for low level crimes. This practice is  regarded as quite troublesome, as it can bring significant consequences for individuals, wasting valuable police  resources and being often used i n combination with other fraudulent behaviour.   Recently the Spanish national police have adopted  the VeriPol AI system in order to detect false police  reports . The system was designed to be integrated into the existing Spanish National Police information system  called SIDENPOL, allowing for easier use and integration into existing work practices. Its development  was the  result of a collaborative project between the University of Cardiff, the Charles III University of Madrid and the  Spanish National Police.  The database of police reports was been made available for the researchers of the  universities in order to train the AI system on. For this, 1122 reports were used, including 534 true and 588   false reports.   VeriPol exploit s a combination of Natural Langu age Processing and machine learning classification algorithms,  capable of estimating the probability of false police reports with significant accuracy. In addition to that, the  system also enables insights into the differences between false and true police  reports. For example, pilot  studies found that false police reports are more likely to include shorter statements, focused on the objects  which were stolen and lacking details.   Following the development, the system was tested in pilot situations in both t he police department of Malaga  and Murcia. These pilots have been regarded as successful because an increase in the number of false reports  was detected. Furthermore, an anonymous survey among the staff showed that the VeriPol sy stem was useful,  easy to us e but  should include more functionalities to detect other forms of crime.    Now the system has been rolled out for use by all the departments of the Spanish National Police. The expected  impact of the use of the system is to both detect false reports early,  leaving more police resources  available  to  focus on other tasks and reports, while  at the same time  deter ring people from filing fake statements in the  first place. An additional benefit of the system is to gain more insight s into how people lie to police officers as  well as to gain more knowledge in detecting true and false police reports.     
  48   3.3 Focus on AI and data g overnance   3.3.1  Exploring AI and data g overnance  dilemmas and traps   As the previous case studies show, it is of prominen t importance for successful AI adoption  and implementation ,  to examine the legal and regulatory aspects  as a complementary focus of the exploratory research to map  and analyse the landscape of AI in public services . Having this goal in mind , we have conduc ted an overview of  existing AI -related legal and policy instruments to understand the role played in AI and data  driven  transformation  of the European public sector.33 The aim was to better understand drivers and barriers to AI  adoption in public services, and thus set the basis for both the analysis of national AI strategies and the  development of the methodology for impact assessment, described respectively in Section 4  and Section 5 .   The research underpinning the analysis was structured in three stages: i) the analysis of legal and data  governance implications of the use of AI in government; ii) the investigation of complementarities in data and  AI governance processes; and iii) the assessment of which AI governance methods best support ed trust and  theref ore strengthen ed government legitimacy.   As a matter of fact, t he rush to understand new socio -economic contexts created by the wide adoption of AI is  justified by its far -ranging consequences, spann ing almost every walk of life - from labour markets  (Frey &  Osborne, 2017) , through human rights protection  (Eubanks, 2018) to healthcare  (Jiang et al., 2017) . Yet, the  public sector’s predicament is often a  double bind: its obligat ions to protect citizens from potential  algorithmic  harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own ef ficiency or - in other words  - to govern  algorithms, while governing by algorithms . Whether such dual role is even possible  has been a matter of  long lasting debate34.   The main  challenge stems from algo rithms’ intrinsic properties, which  make them distinct from other ICT  solutions, long embraced by the governments: vast computing power - incompatible with human cognitive  capabilities; ‘learning’ capacity - autonomous knowledge creation happening without proper supervision;  profiling  ability  – of categorizing traits and behaviours; and a nudging - incentivizing compliance – attitude: all  these elements  create externalities that rule -based programming normally lacks.   Reduced costs of digital information ga thering ( price effect ) have led to the creation of unprecedented amounts  of data ( quantity effect), and shifted human activities away from non -digital environments ( substitution effect ),  hence rendering data sharing one of the key enablers of modern public  services, facilitating efficient and cost effective service delivery  (Martens, 2018) . Its benefits include data linking – when two sets of records allow to  derive previously unavailable insights; more tailored interventions, especially when dat a and project ownership  is scattered across many agencies; better allocation of public resources; and monitoring of service outcomes.   The upside of sharing data in the research environment has long been appreciated and enacted – including  for  the purposes  of transparency, reproducibility of results, research acceleration and fostering collaboration. At  the same time, some diffused  concerns  linked with data sharing include: the risk of data loss; statistical  disclosure ; revealing the identity of  an individu al by the unique or rare combination of characteristics  within a  dataset ; and the potentially negative impacts of secondary usage of personal data, which the owner  would  prefer to remain  private in a given context  (Involve UK, 2017) .  Therefore , a dilemma  naturally emerges between securing citizens’ privacy and maximizing the  efficiency of service delivery . As a rule of thumb, it should be borne in mind that citizens tend to be more  likely to accept the necessity of data sharing, if there is a pu blic benefit (however defined)  clearly perceived .  However , there is ample evidence that users find it difficult to turn their privacy preferences into meaningful  decisions, sacrificing long -term privacy for immediate gains  (Coll, 2015) .   Furthermore, citizens ’ perception towards data sharing is only one of the issues to consider while  using AI in  the public sector . Relying on automated methods follows an all too  familiar pattern : stakeholders initially  consider decision making aids trustworthy, then after observing that errors happen they distrust even the most  reliable applications . In brief , a too early adoption of faulty applications puts the trust in the syst em at risk.35                                              33 This exploratory study was conducted by Maciej Kuziemski, Research Fellow  at The Berkman Klein Center for Internet an d Society at  Harvard University under the direct supervision of Gianluca Misuraca.   34 See for example Lodge, M., Mennicken, A., (2017). The importance of regulation of and by algorithm, in: Yeung, K. (2017). Algorithmic  regulation: a critical interrogation , Regulation & Governance   35 As already  highlighted in Dzindolet, M., et. al., (2003). The role of trust in automation reliance, International Journal of Human -Computer  Studies  
  49   Similarly, public sector’s reliance on voluntary best practices and self -regulation fares well, as long as no  misdemeanour  is found on the side of data processors - as exemplified by the public outrage and calls for  regulation of Internet platforms that have ignored self -imposed standards , even after  the introduction of the  EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which has forced companies processing data to conform and  introduce new handling and security practices .   Along the same vei n, a recent study pointed to the abstraction traps  specific to machine learning  - or how  algorithms fail to properly account for or understand the interactions between technical systems and social  worlds  (Selbst et al., 2019) .   These include: a) The framing trap  - failure to model the entire system over which a social criterion, such as  fairness, will be enforced ; b) The portability trap - failure to understand how re -purposing algorithmic solutions  designed for one social context may be misleading, inaccurate, o r otherwise do harm when applied to a different  context ; c) The formalism trap - failure to account for the full meaning of social concepts such as fairness,  which can be procedural, contextual, and contestable, and cannot be resolved through mathematical  formalisms ; d) The ripple effect trap - failure to understand how the insertion of technology into an existing  social system changes the behavio urs and embedded values of the pre -existing system ; and e) The solutionism  trap - failure to recognize the possi bility that the best solution to a problem may not involve technology .  3.3.2  Data g overnance  regimes and regulatory tools for AI   The development of AI is driven by the merging of enormous amounts of data with powerful machine learning  algorithms. However, it is impossible to talk about an emerging AI landscape, without looking at existing data  governance regimes and practices . In fact, existing data protection and AI governance landscapes seemingly  have a lot in common. Landmark achievements in the field of data protection – such as GDPR – would not be  possible without years and years of  negotiation, established fora, robust civil society  advocacy , infrastructure  and enforcement mechanisms. It would be only logical for AI governance – that is rule -making around  algorithms that process data – to be established in accord, and as an extension of the legacy and infrastructure  of data protection and competition regulation.   To the contrary, what seems to be happening, is an effort driven by the narrative of exceptionalis m, whereby  AI (however defined) is a phenomenon that is immune to existing governance structures, policies and laws. A  gold rush to become a rule -maker in the field of AI governance has seen governments, international  organisation s, and corporations publis h dozens of ( similar) frameworks, strategies, and guidelines36. These  documents reflect a longing after effective global coordination and rule -based order, yet – for the most part –  omit or override existing governance mechanisms and institutions, as if the y were completely mis matched for  ‘the age of AI ’.   There have been recurrent warnings against the creation of such regulatory silos that would favo ur technocratic  frameworks over a comprehensive view of the effects of data on the economy, society and environment. Many  of these warnings could be applicable to the current setup of AI governance in fact.   Further , it would make an enormous difference to think of AI governance as an extension of data  protection and competition regulations , acting hand in hand to reduce harms and secure human dignity.  Such effort – instead of happening in a vacuum – would help update major existing regulations (i. e. GDPR) to   make t hey work where they do not: by addressing massive imbalances in power, advancing data portability and  privacy by design or securing EU wide, public digital infrastructure.   With the current turn of attention towards AI, it is useful to assess existi ng and emerging regulatory scenarios  and tools that will gain traction in the future . Existing portfolio s of regulatory measures include, but are not  limited to: national strategies, antitrust and consumer protection measures, ethical guidelines, impact  assessments, data protection enforcement, bans and standards and Intellectual Property ( IP) protection  rules.   At the same time, a s the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector intensify,  it would be  important to examine how  machine learning and bureaucracy have both ‘become generalizable  modes of rational ordering based on abstraction and deriving authority from claims to neutrality and  objectivity ’.37                                               36 For an overview of the comparabili ty of existing governance frameworks, see  Fjeld, J et. al., Principled Artificial Intelligence: Mapping  Consensus in Ethical and Rights -Based Approaches to Principles for AI. Berkman Klein Center Research Publication No. 2020 -1. 2020   37 As presented at the Data Justice Lab in 2019 on  AI Realism and structural alternatives  
  50   With that  purpose  in mind, one should consider  how existing data governan ce regimes and national regulatory  practices can be transforming  and not just intensifying  existing power asymmetries . Nation states around the  world are adopt ing bespoke strategies concerning the development of AI. These strategies prove to be a  successful framework to direct public sector’s attention, mobilize resources, and mandate horizontal  coordination. At the same time, their wide -ranging scope and form, as well as often solely advisory nature,  hampers meaningful com parison. Going forward, for national strategies to be successful, it would be necessary  to develop common standards for goal formulation, execution and measurement .  One could argue that the strongest AI policy instruments can be found within the competitio n law and consumer  protection legislation. Great concentration of data has translated into huge market power, which in turn  has  fuelled cases of market domination, unfair competition and infringement of consumer protection measures.   Recent reports by Germa n and French antitrust authorities ha ve concluded, in fact, that existing competition  laws are sufficient to tackle the challenges posed by unique market features related to AI , such as  pricing algorithms (Bundeskartellamt & Autorité de la concurrence, 2019) . It is therefore no longer a question  of the enforcers having the right tools to intervene, but rather whether thei r intervention can be prompt enough  to prevent irreparable harm s.   Furthermore, there are instances when emerging technologies could also empower citizens : a new  wave of consumer -empowering AI  such as automating the reading and legal assessment of online c onsumer  contracts and privacy policies  is making strides to counter market dominance and enforce compliance . This  could assist in evaluating unfair contractual terms and GDPR  infringements , using machine learning and  grammar -based approaches .  By far the most diffused  regulatory response, both within the private and public sectors , is the introduction of  voluntary ethical codes and guidelines to steer the development and use of AI . The review  by Field  and others  of almost 50 of such ethical frameworks developed globally shows that they  cluster across eight  main themes (privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility and promoti on of human values).  However, these frameworks tend to give little attention to structural and fundamental issues such as power,  democratic oversight, climate or health catastrophe s, as the current COVID -19 p andemi c has clearly  demonstrated .  3.3.3  The need for a  new paradigm on impact assessment of AI and data governance   Common perceptions of AI governance are heavily influenced by a prevalent narrative that sustains AI as a  pervasive, inevitable, almost nature -like force that will change every walk of life. Prop onents of such framing –  which , not surprisingly , includes  companies whose value offering is around AI-related products – direct our  attention to implementation modes, and away from questioning the foundations of our relationship with  emerging technologies .   This focus on ‘how’, and away from ‘why’, questions narrows the scope of reflection to ‘fixing ’ or ‘solving ’ the  problems emerging with AI  implementation , such as bias and unfairness. The proposition usually reads as  follows: once we remove human bias from datasets used to train algorithms and encode fairness as an  objective, we will be able to use computation  widely  to achieve better decision -making  outcomes.   This narrow framing obscure s the causes of AI problems,  turning  their solutions into  mere tec hnicalit ies. Reality  goes differently: for instance, ensuring computational fairness can be counterproductive when the   underrepresentation of one ethnic group in a dataset translate s into increased targeting of that group. Above   all, the inherent problem w ith centring attention on bias and unfairness is the underlying assumption that  making human  decision s more ‘machine supported ’ is a value per se , and that the only question is ‘how’ and  not ‘why’.  With the rise of the automated decision -making systems wit hin the public sector and beyond  it, there  have been propos als to extend the scope of existing impact assessments to cover  the likely consequences of  their usage.  One of the seminal reports that initiated the policy debate around these issues, call ed for so called  algorithmic impact assessments (AIAs)  to become a part of public sector’s procurement procedure. The proposed  process was envisaged to mirror existing ones, used to assess e.g. environmental or privacy related impacts.   Some of the potential benefits of rolling out AIAs  would  include: better communication with the general public;  increase of in-house expertise of public agencies; higher levels of accountability of automated decision -making   systems and a meaningful way for the public to questio n them .  
  51   Another type of AI -related impact assessment was introduced under GDPR’s art. 35 , the so -called  DPIAs - Data  Protection Impact Assessments . These  are conducted by data processors involved in activities  that are  likely to  result in high risk to ind ividuals’ rights and freedoms, are focus ed on individual and societal harms, and provid e  the opportunity to assess not only pure compliance risks, but also broader effects  on individual  rights and  freedoms, including the potential for significant social or  economic disadvantage.   Scholars have established that  DPIAs could be considered examples of AIAs, and analysed  their shortcomings,  includ ing that the DPIA process leaves limited room for accountability and involvement of the general public  (Kaminski & Malgieri, 2019).. All in all, it is concluded that should sufficient levels of transparency around DPIAs  results be kept,  they could form a basis for a multi -layered explanation process .   With the start of the new decade, it is  becoming  clear that the AI policymaking landscape needs to move beyond  the platitudes of voluntary ethical frameworks, towards more granular, context -specific instruments legitimized  by the democratic processes. This implies in our opinion, the need to move from the ‘how’ to the ‘why’ of  AI governance . Whereas the former  focuses on improving exi sting systems, the latter poses  fundamental  questions abou t power balance and governance  systems38.   In the future , policymakers should thus abandon the narrative of exceptionalism and start learning lessons from  other instances of quantification , perhaps considering ethical codes applicable across the board : from edit  scores, through data prediction models (Saltelli, 2020) . In addition, more detailed reflections  might be ignited   on the semantic interoperability of AI – to resolve framing issues that have annoyingly kept the value conflicts  of all proposed solutions under the radar . In so doing, t he discussions around technological impacts would  move  away from the circle of newly minted AI ethicists, towards the most affected targets - end users and citizens,  the ‘low-level experts ’ (Veale, 2020) .   In this context, r egardless of the regulatory approaches deployed by specific countries and at international level,  it would be  useful to consider the consequences  of AI deployment  through the four di stinct lense s: design,  institutions, timing and monitorin g (Bennett Moses, 2016) . More specifically :   Design  could imply to compare, since the early stages,  technology specificity vs neutrality (limits  of predictive capacity, interpretab ility, ease of application and enforcement) , ‘treating technology  as the object … in the formulation of rules or regulatory regimes ’;   Institutions  should be considered at the different possible levels of regulation, considering that   the slower the institution regulating (eg. higher level) the more technology neutral it should be to  allow for changes;    Timing  would refer to the so -called  Collingridge dilemma (An information problem: impacts cannot  be easily predicted until the technology is extensivel y developed and widely used. A power problem:  control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched);    And finally  Monitoring  might imply multiple dimensions:  e.g. technology horizon scanning, impact  assessment, iteration/agility, citizen  participation  etc.    While it is out of the scope of this report  to enter into much detail at present, these lense s will return useful  when discussing about the analysis of the public sector focus on AI national strategies, as well as in the  conceptualisat ion of the methodology for impact assessment that will be outlined as part of the next phase of  this research, and  introduced respectively in Section 4  and Section 5  that follow .                                                   38 See for example Pasquale, F., The Second Wave of Algorithmic  Accountability, Law and Political Economy. 2019  
  52   4 National Strategies: focus  on AI for the public sector   4.1 Scope and approach   One of the main goals  of the AI Watch is to monitor and analyse the implementation of AI national strategies  developed by Member States in line with the Coordinated Action Plan.39 The aim is to gather information on all  EU Member States' national initiative s on AI, with the purpose of having a complete overview of national plans,  measures and strategies related to AI. A first report on ‘National strategies on Artificial Intelligence: a European  perspective in 2019 ‘ has been published and provided input to the data collection and analysis of national  strategies of the OECD AI Policy Observat ory launched in February 2020.40 The analysis conducted in 2019 as  part of the AI Watch present s information on  EU Member States' national AI strategies in a st ructured and  comprehensive way, with the aim to develop a common AI Policy Framework that can be used for the  compar ison of the strategies, so to identify areas for strengtheni ng synergies and collaboration.41  As we have anticipated, t he European Commission has been regarding AI as a technology of strategic  importance for the future of the European Dig ital Economy, and  it has been actively stimulating the  development and diffusion of these new technologies through funding and strategies. In this perspective, the  proposal advanced by the European Commission for a Digital Europe Programme (DEP)  aimed to dedicate a  consistent part of the financial resources to AI development , showing the urgency of investments in the field.    As a matter of fact AI has been heralded as the key technology which will drive the next industrial revolution.   To this end, a n important aspect of the proposal for the Digital Europe Programme is the crucial role that the  public sector should play to make sure that AI is fully implemente d in EU Member States . To this end  the DEP calls for ensuring that the public sector and areas of public interests, such as health and care, education,  transport, and the cultural and creative sectors, can deploy and access state of -the-art digital technologies.  Moreover, it suggest to promote offering public administrations access to testing and piloting of digital  technologies, including their cross -border use, for which it is also requested to provide more interoperable pu blic  services across the EU and at EU level. In addition, the DEP propose to build up and strengthen the network of  European Digital Innovation Hubs, to help both companies and public administrations, benefit from digital  opportunities, aiming to have a Hu b in every region and giving a particular attention to local administrations  and especially cities, as it is at the local level that most AI applications in public services are indeed emerging.   The potential of AI for the public sector  has been ve ry high o n the political agenda of EU  Member States  already since the Ministerial Tallinn Declaration on eGovernment  adopted in 2017  and furth er reinforced at  both the Digital and eGovernment High Level Conference  organised under the Austrian Presidency of t he EU  Council in September 2018  and the Digital Government Conference: Next steps for a human -centric digital  government , organised by the Finnish Presidency of the EU Council in October 2019, where the eme rging debate  on AI has been fram ed within the context of the  policy priorit ies of the Tallinn Declaration and in particular the  need to ensure enabling drivers required to nurture a data ecosystem fertile for AI to be grounded and effective.   In this perspe ctive, to complement the mapping conducted on AI in public services (see Sections 2 and 3  of  this report) and supplement the analysis of the National AI strategies made as part of the AI Watch  activities   recalled above, we have carried out a review of the Member States strategies  focusing on the activities  dedicated to enhance use of AI for the public sector and to improve public services delivery.   At the end of May 2020 the following countries have published an official AI national strategy: Czech Republi c,  Cyprus,  Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,  Portugal, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (part of the EU still in 2019), as well as Norway and Switzerland  who also signed the EU Declaration on A I and are associated to the Coordinated Action Plan.    In addition to the 16 countries that have dedicated official strategies on AI by the end of February, 5 countries  were in the final drafting phase and many others have developed various policy documents  that includes  references to AI.                                               39 See https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch/national -strategies -artificial -intelligence_en    40 See https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch/oecdai_en   41 In this sense, the analysis of national strategies conducted by  AI Watch follows a similar approach as that used in the AI strategies,  presenting policy initiatives from a  holistic perspective. To highlight the numerous economic and policy outlooks from which the  transformative nature of AI can be explored, it presents policy initiatives across various policy areas, including human capi tal (i.e. educational  development), fr om the lab to the market (i.e. research and development, innovation, business and public sector development), networking  (i.e. collaboration and dissemination), regulation (i.e. ethical guidelines, legislation and standardisation) and infrastruct ure (i.e. data and  telecommunication infrastructure). This analysis will be updated and released on an annual basis and the collaboraton with th e OECD on  collecting and analysing national strategies on AI in the EU Member States will be further strenghtened.  
  53   However, this review takes into consideration only the official strategies published by the end of February 2020  and available in English42 as indicated in the table below.43 44   TABLE 12 OVERVIEW OF NA TIONAL AI STRATEGIES ANALYSED   # Country  Published Date   1 Czech Republic  May 2019   2 Denmark  March 2019   3 Estonia  May 2019   4 Finland  June 201945  5 France  March 2018   6 Germany  November 2018   7 Lithuania  April 2019   8 Luxembourg  May 2019   9 Malta  October 2019   10 The Netherlands  October 2019   11 Portugal  April 2019   12 Sweden  May 2018   13 United Kingdom  April 201846  The aim of this Section  in fact is not to provide a detailed analysis of the AI National strategies, rather to gain  a better understanding of the main elements of each country’s strategy relevant to set the ground for a deeper  assessment of the specific initiatives regarding the  use of AI in the public sector. This preliminary overview  serves also to provide insights for  peer learning  through comparison of the different actions Member States  are taking with regards to promoting the use of AI within the government  and in public services .   While there has been great investments and interest in AI, the application of AI technologies within the  government has not been gaining as much attention as applications in the private sector. Within this perspective,  the role of  the government in AI is often seen merely as that of a regulator or as a facilitator . The  regulatory role of governments in AI falls on providing guidance or legal and regulatory frameworks to minimize  the potential risks of AI while enabling the maximum opportunities  from its application . In the facilitator’s role,  governments are frequently argued to be a source of funding (or other support) to stimulate the development  and adoption of AI. Governments are often asked to improve the availability of their data to private businesses  as to  assist in the development of AI.   Actual usage of AI within the government in order to improve public services, policymaking and internal  operations are frequently left out of scope or do  not gain the same amount of in teres t and related in vestment.  Therefore, this review is not about AI g overnance, rather regards  the actions governments are currently  taking to stimulate or facilitate the deve lopment and use of AI in their public administrations .  Governance frameworks, such a s ethical guidance or regulatory reform, are included only  as they could be seen  as an instrument to assist organi sations to use AI (in a responsible way), but they are not the main focus of the  overview as the uptake and use of AI does not solely rely on having ethical fr ameworks  of course .                                              42 In this respect it should be noted that not all strategies are (fully) translated to English at this moment which limits comparis ons in case  some elements are left out in the English versions. In our analysis a further check and deeper investigation has been h owever done for  documents available in various EU languages mastered by the research team, including Danish, Dutch, French, Italian and Spanish.   43 Differently from the analysis conducted as part of task 5 of the AI Watch, which includes information on all 28 EU member sta tes, we  considered only the AI Strategies that were officially published by the central government. Moreover, for countries with m ultiple AI Strategy  documents, only the latest and most recent version have been consulted. Other documents published by non -governmental actors – no  matter how influential in their respective country – are not considered official documents and thus not in cluded in this report. Similarly,  despite many countries have included AI -related actions in broader digitalisation strategies, we have not considered them in this review as  these initiatives could be scattered among various policy documents. It is therefo re possible that some Member States do have policy  initiatives dedicated to stimulating AI in the public sector, but not specifically mentioned in their AI Strategy.   44 Although Latvia  published the official strategy in February 2020, the official translation to English was not available at the moment  of  preparing this report. T herefore, it has not been taken into consideration. It should however be noticed that from looking at the vers ion  machine translated and discussing with Government representatives it has an important focus on public sector and public servi ces.  45 The analysis considers the latest AI Strategy of Finland, containing insights from the 2017 AI Strategy and relevant act ion plans.   46 We considered the latest official AI Strategy of the UK, although other documents on AI in the public sector not covered in t his analysis.  
  54   4.2 A framework of analysis  for AI strategies in the public sector   With the aim to shed some  light on the depth and scope of the AI strategies of Member States , this policy  review is complementary to the monitoring and anal ysis conducted as part of the AI Watch described above,  for it provid es a descri ption of the main activities addressing the use of AI in t he public sector.   In this respect, despite the fact that  not all the 13 strategies analysed had  a specific chapter de dicated to the  applicat ion of AI in the public sector, the review looked at what countries are currently proposing  and/or  implementing to increase the uptake of AI within their administrations. The analysis contained in this report in  fact does not intend to evaluate the validity of the instruments proposed, but rather to compare the efforts and  plans of different countries and  to serve  as an instrument for knowledge exchange  and peer -learning .  For this purpose, a basic framework of analysis has been design ed and may be further integrated into the  holistic approach developed for the analysis of AI Strategies of Member states, to which we already provided  input and some inspiration. While of course there may be other, more general , relevant  actions where the  government might be directly or indirectly involved when it comes to AI , in this study we have limited our  analysis to the text of the strategic documents.   While each strategy has different priorities relevant to each country’s situation and context , a nu mber of policy  initiatives have bee n identified that seem to be occurring  in several Member States and have been classified  according to the following ‘policy themes  and actions ’:  a. Stimulating awareness and potential of AI   These initiatives focus on stimulating awareness among civil servants on AI in order to share their understanding  and to provide opportunities to detect in which areas AI could be valuable for their work. While a number of  different awareness activities ar e mentioned in the various strategies, three main ones are recurrent : holding  awareness campaigns  for civil servants  or public sector workers on AI;  organizing regular meetings  between  civil servants either in institutions or in specialized innovation hubs  or by participating in policy  events   organised  by European institutions or other relevant parties.   b. Improving d ata management for AI   These initiatives aim to improve the quality , availability and accessibility of  public sector data in order to develop  and implement AI. Some of these policy actions focus on improving the data quality  of public sector data;  both for internal as well as external use. Common actions that are part of this scheme are establishing data  management programmes , organizing training t o improve data literacy  or changing the technical  infrastructure  to improve data governance and quality across the public sector. Another set of policy initiatives  focus on improving data access  to public sector data.   While some of these initiatives aim t o improve the availability and quality of public sector data for private  sector use, some strategies similarly highlight that other public sector organisation s would be able to use these  datasets, fostering inter -organisation al data transfers. Initiatives such as stimulating open data  or improving  the open data websites for developing AI are frequently listed. Plans to improve access by public  institutions to private sector data are also considered. Many private organisation s hold data that is  potentially h ighly valuable for public sector AI, but proper frameworks or arrangements are required to share  this data in a responsible way with public institutions.   c. Building internal c apacity  on AI   Every  technology offers very limited value if people do not have the intention or the abilities to use it at its full  potential. For AI, this is no different. Therefore, some strategies focus on enhancing  the internal capacity  in  public administrations with regard to AI-related skills. Public institu tions need to have civil servants with the  right capacities and skills to develop and/or use AI in their operations. Therefore  some of the policy initiatives  include having AI training for all public officials to make sure there is general knowledge of what AI is and  could do in their respective tasks . These training  activities  will assist in building the know -how to detect where  AI could be used, to build trust in AI innovations and to understand how current AI would be best combined in  their work, assisti ng in the adoption of AI applications. While some training is of general nature, other policy  actions focus on specialized AI training  for technical personnel. These specialist training programmes are  aimed at working with large datasets and focus on devel oping AI for public sector use. Lastly, some strategies  also focus on creating new positions or institutions  such as Chief Data Officers or specialized AI teams to  stimulate AI development within the public sector.  
  55   d. Learning by doing   Since AI is still a ne w set of technologies , there is still a limited understanding of the way it is developed and  applied , especially  in public sector contexts. Therefore, a variety of countries have mentioned some AI flagship  projects which will be used to learn from AI imple mentations and its effects. Based on the experiences of these  initiatives , knowledge could be shared among institutions and revisions of the AI strategies made in the future.  Understandably, some countries mention a large variety of different projects and others only a couple, but the  general argumentation is that these pilot projects will serve as a benchmark for future AI initiatives . In some  countries, regulatory sandboxes  are being established to provide an experimental setting or safe area to test  AI applications before they are deployed on a larger scale.   e. Developing e thical and legal AI framework s  As there are many ethical concerns with the development and use of AI, and this is of particular relevance when  it comes to public services, many strategies  are exploring the ethical considerations of using AI. Some strategies  mention the intention to develop an ethical framework  to act as a guidance for all public sector AI usages.  Such a framework document could assist in establishing trust – among both civ il servants and citizens – to  ensure that the AI used in government is of high quality and in line with ethical values. Other initiatives aim to  conduct  legal reforms in order to facilitate AI development and use  as, sometimes, it is mentioned that barrier s  for AI development  are the limitations in data sharing between public institutions or with private companies.   Therefore, some countries are exploring how to review  the regulatory framework s to facilitate data  sharing  with public or private actors to develop AI. Some of these reforms will be sector -specific, such as in  the healthcare  sector , while some strategies mention the possibility to explor e general AI laws  which – among  other goals – aim to clarify the accountab ility and transparency issues related to  the use of AI  in public services .   f. Allocating f unding and procurement   This set of policy actions has the goal to stimulate the development and uptake of AI by providing adequate  funding  and mechanisms for adopting t echnological innovation in the public sector . Often, in fact, innovation in  the pu blic sector is hindered due to  lack of appropriate funding schemes . Therefore, some strategies highlight  the need to establish special funding programmes  to provide financial  resources for AI experiments and  projects in the public sector. While the amount of funding of these countries varies, they do allow the initiation  of some AI initiatives. Another set of policy actions focus on stimulating the private sector in providing AI  solutions for the public sector. By stimulating AI or GovTech startups  to develop AI tailored for the public  sector, more creative AI solutions might be made available. As part of enabling  public -private partnerships in  developing  appropriate AI solutio ns for public sector use, some strategies mention  also the need for  revisions  to existing public procurement regulation  in order to provide more accessible ways to contract with the  public sector. It has been mentioned in various strategies that the develo pment of AI requires a more interactive  approach which should be reflected with new procurement processes.    Based on this framework of analysis, Table 13 below provides an overview of the  policy actions proposed in  each theme, and of which countries mention them in their strategies . To this end, each strategy has been  benchmarked to check if it  lists one or more of the  themes  identified . This comparison only highlights the  concrete policy actions or statements  to do certain actions  made in the strategies . Some countries in fact do  mention challenges related to public sector adoption of AI, but d o not provide any explicit action to tackle them  and are therefore not represented in the overview.   Clearly, as with any comparison, sacrifices in nuances have had  to be made to allow an easy review . In addition,  the comparison does no t take into consider ation neither  the depth nor the amount of resources  that countries  plan to invest in the  different activities. Furthermore , as the analysis is mostly interpretative, some parts of the  strategies might have been overlooked or  even misunderstood, influencing  the findings of this preliminary  review . The aim of this study is in fact to provide a contextual framework for the analysis of the current  state of the art of AI use in public services in the EU  and could be used for knowledge transfer among  Member States . It should thus be considered as an instrument to foster future analysis,  rather to provid e a  conclusive statement on the actions  that Member States are taking.  Likewise, it can serve as a call for action  for Member States to devote more resources into promoting the use of AI within the public sector ,  rather than mainly stimulating private sector adoption.

In particular, a s it can be seen in the overview, there are considerable differences in what  actions Mem ber States are taking to ensure the  uptake of AI in the public sector.   Nevertheless , there are several policy actions wh ich are mentioned more often in the countries’ strategies. More  specifically , the actions that are the most present  are those  aimed to improve the data used for AI in the  public sector . Almost all strategies mention improving data accessibility of public s ector data to improve and  enhance AI uptake. In addition, improving the data quality of the public sector data is also frequently mentioned  by the strategies, showing that many governments realise the importance of having a strong data infrastructure  within the public sector as data is the lifeblood for any AI -applications.   Many strategies also mention exploring the hosting of awareness campaigns  to highlight the importance and  possibilities of AI in the public sector. Frequently, these awareness campaigns  are based on the successes of AI  pilot projects conducted by the Member States. Many governments mention existing projects or planned AI pilots  which will enable learning by doing and to illustrate success stories across the government. Often, the strateg ies  mention  establishing training programmes for civil servants on AI  in order to equip them with the required  skills to either develop, procure or use AI technologies in their professions is mentioned.   Furthermore, many strategies underline  plans to implement an ethical or regulatory framework  to provide  guidance for the deployment of AI in the public sector. These guidelines are argued to be a way to ensure the  ethical use of AI and to minimize possible negative effects of AI within their societie s. While the development  of these frameworks is often mentioned, only one country aims to implement a general AI law to assist AI  uptake in the public sector , if this is deemed necessary .  
  57   4.3 Overview  of EU national strategies focus on AI for the public secto r  Following the overview and comparison presented above, this sub -section  describe s the main relevant activities  of each AI Strategy analysed . In doing so, a brief  introduction into the aim of the strategy is given, followed by  the go als and actions that e ach country is planning  to take with regards to the upt ake of AI in the public sector.   4.3.1  Czech Republic   The AI Strategy of  the Czech R epublic  (or Czech ia) contains a variety of actions to stimulate the use of AI within  the public sector. Within the strategy,  the public sector  has been given a variety of roles in order to stimulate  the development and use of AI. The public  administration has been regarded as coordinator, co -coordinator and  co-operator , depending on different activities . The government is seen  as contribut ing to enabling the potential  of AI by making data available, improving the digital infrastructure and introducing modern public services. Most  of the str ategy is aimed at developing the enabling environment for the Czech economy to make maximu m use  of AI by stimulating businesses, data standards, ethical and regulatory frameworks  and research.   The document also highlights that the Czech government aims to create conditions for the development and  application of AI in key public services , such as health and transport. The government acknowledges the  potential of AI to improve a variety of governmental services and allows the public administration  to be more  produc tive with a better  quality of services. It names several activities to stimulate th ese objectives , such as :   Public administrations should be involved in AI policy development , particularly in R&D or knowledge  transfer , including in digital innovation hubs. The government is exploring methods such as hackathons to  create opportunities for  the private sector to discuss possible new applications of AI in the public sector.    By 2021, the Czech Government plans to identify specific legislative barriers to the research, development  and use of AI in each sector    There are also plans to develop a  binding public administration data availability plan for the use of AI by  2021. Within this plan,  special attention will be given to data standards. In addition, a programme for the  collection and protection of high -quality health care data for the use in  AI will be implemented by 2021.    Furthermore, b y 2021, the Czech government aims to have a start -up support programme to assist the  establishment of businesses working on AI applications in the public sector. Especially AI for public services  or those in areas of the national interest and specialization in the country  will be  valued.    By 2021, there should be a number of AI pilot projects within the public administration and health care.  By 2027, there should be ground -break ing AI projects within the publi c sector which enable simplifying the  life for citizens and businesses, streamlin ing activities and increas ing the added value of public services.  There are plans to use AI in a variety of healthcare -related services , such as the administration of medical  products and devices, reimbursement processes, reporting of interventions, predictions of costs, and the  processing of data , as part of the National eHealth Strategy. Other plans include the use of AI in social  services in order t o facilitate citizens to stay at home , even when fragile conditions arise, as long as  possible.    The Czech Government will also promote the use of high -performance computing by the public sector.   4.3.2  Denmark   The Danish National AI Strategy has, among its key objectives, that the public sector should use AI in order to  offer world -class services to citizens. There is a clear general understanding that a public sector using AI could  improve public services to be more aligned to the needs of citizens. As a result , the Danish government has  three overarching goals in the strategy with regards to public sector AI:   1. Being one of the leading countries in Europe in using data and AI to improve and target public services ;  2. Having a public sector which uses in a systematic  way a framework and methods to support the  responsible use of AI. This in return ensures that the investment in AI is utilised as well as possible ;  3. Public authorities should have a good framework to utilise data to develop AI  solutions.   The strategy menti ons that several public institutions in Denmark have already used AI technologies in various  ways such as in application forms, customer service calls or invoici ng. Experiences from the health care sector  show that AI can indeed enable faster and better tre atments. In addition to the national AI Strategy, the Danish 
  58   government launched the World -Class Digital Services programme as part of its public sector reform  programme . This strategy aims to increase the  quality of digital public services of which AI will be a part of.   As the Danish public sector is one of the most digitised in the world with access to a well -developed digital  infrastructure, high -quality public sector data and a population with good IT skills, the strategy argues that the  Danish governme nt is in a good starting point for AI adoption and mainstream use  in public services too.   More specifically, t he Danish government is planning to create a responsible ethical and legal framework for  the use of AI, for both the private and the public sector . It argues that the public sector will gain confidence  when it will be working with these frameworks.   Other actions the Danish government is taking is in improving the data quality and quantity for usage by public  and private actors for AI. To stimulate a variety of AI applications, there will be a common resource to develop  language -based AI and better access to non -personal public sector data. The government expects that by  making these resources available , both private and public actors will be able to  develop higher -quality AI  solutions utilizing already high -quality public data.   The Danish government is also aware that technology does not provide any value on its own, but only adds  value in the interaction with people. This requires strong IT compete ncies in all layers of society, including the  public sector. However, the government acknowledges that there is a lack of expertise and experience within  the government on AI. Therefore, one of the ambitions of the government is to enhance digital competen ces in  the central government. An internal academy for central government will be established in order to provide  generalist training courses.  In addition, the government will hold dialogues with universities working on AI in  order to develop IT specialist  courses for civil servants.   In order to promote awareness of the potential of AI and promote investments in the public sector, the Danish  government will launch a number to initiatives to assist in the development, testing and use of AI by improving  access to capital, consultancy ser vices and experience.   In terms of funding, t he government aims to allocate around 27 million euro s to test and deploy new  technologies in municipalities and regions. The National Centre for Public Sector Innovation will also support the  deployment and use of AI across the public sector by disseminating experience from research and projects.   The strate gy lists a number of current AI pilots in the public sector , some of which are labelled  Signature  Projects. These Signature Projects are supposed to improve the experience in AI solutions and to contribute to  larger scaling of AI in all of the country . There are three main policy areas where Signature Projects are being  launched: healthc are, social and employment services,  and cross -authority case processing. These projects will  be selected in collaboration with municipalities and regions and will be receiv ing funding to test the use of AI.   The following p ilots and signature projects are mentioned in the strategy:    Chatbot by the Ministry of Education    Early diagnosis of cancer at Odense University Hospital    Optimisation of the drinking water system in the cit y of Aarhus    X-Ray Inspections to detect food quality by Innovation Fund Denmark    Signature Project AI to assist general practitioners in decision support or diagnostics.    Signature Project AI to shorten unemployment periods by making it easier for case offi cers to target  employment efforts to individual citizens    Signature Project AI to improve quality of citizen service centres, automate inquiries and prepare inquiries  for processing such as the application for a building project.   4.3.3  Germany   The Federal Gover nment of Germany has adopted its AI Strategy in November 2018. The main goal of the  strategy is to promote the usage of AI in all parts of society in order to build up Germany’s competitiveness. In  order to stimulate AI adoption in Germany, the government is investing half a billion euros in AI policies.   Within the strategy, it is mentioned that AI offers a lot of potentials for the public sector and public  administration’s operations . However, this is also seen as a necessity as the expectations of citize ns demand a  response from public authorities to make interactions easier, faster and of higher quality as they are expected 
  59   in the private sector. As a result, the strategy has a specific sect ion focusing on using AI for state and  administrative tasks, alt hough limited scope and depth.   The strategy mentions that the use of AI offers the possibility for administrations to provide information and  services more targeted, tailored and accessible to citizens. However, the use of AI in the public sector will als o  mean that new requirements and rules should be put in place. Both the opportunities and the threats of the  new technology should be explored. The strategy mentions that appropriate emergency response and protection  mechanisms will be developed in order t o counter AI -based attacks (especially in the military context).   In order to promote  the usage of AI within the public administrations, the opening of public sector data is highly  regarded and it is suggested to make government data open by default , unles s serious restrictions in te rms of  data protection exist . This option will be explored in the evaluation of the Open Data Act. Another possibility to  improve the provision of open government data is to establish an open data platform for the Federal  Govern ment. This provision of data online would enable different public organisation s to use them for AI in their  organisation s. In order to increase this availability and quality of the data provided by the public sector,  additional funding for data management across public authorities at the federal level will be provided.   4.3.4  Estonia   In May 2019, an expert group - the AI Taskforce - led by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications  and the Estonian Government Office have presented various proposals on ho w to advance the take -up of AI in  Estonia. The current National Strategy is based on these proposals and aims to act as a plan to implement the  Taskforce’s suggestions. Consequently, the national strategy is a sum of different actions aimed to improve the  uptake and adoption of AI in both the public and the private sector. The progress of the implementation of the  actual plan will be monitored by a steering group from the Ministry of Economic Affairs which will present an  annual overview of the progress es.   The current strategy indicates that the Estonian government will invest at least  10 million euros in 2019 -2021  for the execution of the AI Strategy. Among the list of proposed actions, there is a specific section devoted to  advancing the uptake  of AI with in the public sector, in addition to advancing AI uptake in research and  development and in the private sector.   Overa ll, there are 30 proposed actions and existing measures directly addressing AI within the public sector,  with several  agencies responsible  for the m. However, w hile the strategy only sums up the action plans, further  detail s or explanation  on these actions are not included in the document.   Nevertheless, t he Estonian Government has a variety of actions to promote AI and to identify ideas for potential  use cases with in government al agencies. For the senior management of different government agencies, there  will be training courses organised by the Government Office. For managers and specialists, there will be courses  to highlight the value of d ata science and AI. In order to assist civil servants in the procurement of AI, training  sessions will be made available and good practices shared.   There are plans to create a set of guidelines for the procurement of AI within the public sector as well  as  possibilities for joint procurement  between public authorities , so that resources and development for AI can be  shared. In addition, there is also an onl ine course being developed and success stories of current projects will  be published to raise public a wareness of AI.   Other actions involve the launch of regular meetings between the public sector AI network and other institutions  to share experiences and discuss ongoing activities. Various possibilities are being explored to disseminate   knowledge and to exchange  current experiences between different governmental networks.   The Estonian strategy also includes several actions to improve the technical infrastructure and data quality of  the public sector to develop and use  AI. One of the actions foreseen is t he promotion of  the availability of open  data on the Government portal. Moreover, i t is being considered to develop a new IT infrastructure for all public  agencies which makes it possible to process data more cost -effective ly, faster , and on a larger scale .   Additionally, there is the intent to order and make available as many reusable AI components as possible that  could be used by other institutions based on their own needs , without having to start from scratch. In order to  assist agencies in creating tru stworthy data catalogues and metadata, data governance will be developed with  data stewards in agencies and there will be a development of data management  tools. Workshops on data  governance will be conducted and t he semantic interoperability framework wil l also be upgraded in order to  improve the quality of data and meet the needs for AI development.  
  60   A variety of funding mechanisms will be made available to finance AI projects within the government. There  will be funding available for both research on imp lementing AI -based decision -making in Estonian public  administrations and for pilot projects for AI. The planned funding is aimed to be both flexible and sufficient to  start projects which might have higher failure rates in order to learn from the experien ces.   Furthermore, there is a review planned for the evaluation criteria of IT developments in order to plan them as  ongoing system developments and not as one-off projects.  Any new IT projects to be funded should meet  the  requirement to be AI eligible, meaning that the information system should create data in such a way that it can  be applied for future AI projects.   Other actions proposed are  related to the participation in European programmes related to AI policy  development , such as being actively involved in the monitoring of the EU coordinated AI action plan and the AI  High-Level Expert G roup, as well as the establishment of a Chief Data Officer in all the public agencies, and the  development of the concept of inte roperable public sector AI ( BürokrattAI ), a shared AI interface for cit izens  when they interact with  public services .   Finally, the creation of a technological sandbox to test and develop public sector AI applications in a safe  environment  is planned and i f there were legal changes to be made to stimulate the uptake of AI, there should  be a review of the current legal framework, before considering the development of a specific  AI Law.   4.3.5  Finland   The Finnish government was one of the first European countries to release  a dedicated AI Strategy. Based on  the proposal advanced in May 2017, the strategy document has been published building  on the experiences  gained between  2017 and 2019 and la ys the ground  for the future . The aim of the AI Strategy is to prepare  Finland  for the age of AI by making it competitive, able to attract talent , and with an informed and educated  citizenry. In the coming year s, the Action Plan has a number of key measures which should be implemented. A  monitoring group with representatives from both the private and the public sector will be tasked to assess  whether the expected results are being achieve d.   In the Finnish perspe ctive, AI -powered public services are crucial in the further development of the country’s  economy and welfare. Efficient and effective public services strengthen the competitiveness of the economy,  both by improving the ease of doing business and redu cing administrative  costs, but also by enabl ing a well function ing citizenry , and by potentially lur ing talents from across the world.   One of the main themes of the Finnish AI Programme is to make sure that the  public sector is able to use all  the opportunitie s provided by AI and to deliver quality  public services efficiently. As a result, the strategy  encompasses many initiatives and plans to ensure AI technology is implemented effectively in the public sector.   A special group of the Finnish government is tas ked with the government’s digitalisation objectives and ICT  development, including AI ( DigiNYT ). More concretely, one of  the key actions of the AI strategy  is focusing on  building the world’s best public ser vices, acknowledg ing that AI technologies are mer ely a tool for implementing  new and better public services, but that in the end, user acceptance for these new services is the key to success.   This key action is based on early  findings of Finland’s AuroraAI  experiment. AuroraAI  is an AI programme laying  the foundations to transform the Finnish society towards an AI -society in a human -centred and ethically  sustainable manner. The Finnish government argues that the world’s best public administration enables a  society where people are able to learn to underst and their own wellbeing and where public services are tailored  to citizens in a timely, secure and ethical manner. The wellbeing of citizens, companies and society should be  the starting point of such an endeavour. Any reform of public services, the strategy mentions, should follow a  life-events approach , where public services are structured  around specific common events in citizens’  life. This  approach was experimented in the AuroraAI  programme conducted between 2018 and 2019. One o f the lessons  learned from the experiment is the need for organisation al silos to be opened up within the government and  that human -centred operating principles should serve as a starting point for all future governmental services.  However, it is also ment ioned that the capability of employees to work with AI must be enhanced.   The AuroraAI  programme also enabled the creation of a platform that various organisation s – including those  from the private sector – are able to join to provide their services for s pecific life events. It is expected that  public services based on AuroraAI  could potentially eliminate the need for citizens to go through different service  points, enable better public services, create  opportunities for citizens to take better care of the ir wellbeing and  to facilitate collaboration between different  organisation s.   While the AuroraAI  programme will be the leading  one for the AI -enabled public sector reforms, high importance  is given to  the ethical concerns of using AI in public services.  Therefore, there are plans for developing an 
  61   updated regulatory framework  and share ethical design practices , for developing a  monitoring system, and for  promoting the involvement of citizens during the AI development process . Ethical issues related to AI s ystems   transparency and machine supervision should  therefore be tackled.   In addition, there are plans to create a ‘sandbox’ where AI could be developed and tested with personal data  owned by public administrations. These sandboxes are argued to be very use ful in building services around life  events and development of AI in the public interest. In this respect, there is also a recommendation given to  review the current Public Procurement Act in order to enable more effective public -private AI development.   4.3.6  France   France has been the first European country to adopt its AI Strategy, already in  March 2018. The French strategy,  called ‘AI for Humanity’ , is based on the Villani Report; a document led by the renowned  mathematician and  politician Cedric Villani and based on large amounts of interviews with experts.   While a specific section on AI in the public sector is lacking, there are a number of actions and plans suggested  in the strategy in order to achieve all the benefits AI has to offer fo r public services. For example, the strategy  suggests that an AI component has to be integrated into the Digitization Strategy of the French Government  in  order to capture the opportunities AI presents for the d evelopment of public services.   In addition, the strategy highlights the potential of Artificial Intelligence to enable more inclusive public services.  In the report, the difficulties for some citizens to obtain the right amount of information from governmental  websites or the presence of friction po ints in online procedures which create difficulties in providing value of  governmental service  is emphasised . To tackle these issues, the strategy mentions that public authori ties have  to rethink the design  of their administrative procedure s in order to he lp citizens to benefit of public services. In  this process, AI technologies could play a critical role in enabling the  required change by absorbing complex  administrative procedures or personalizing the user experience online.   Hence, the strategy calls fo r an open challenge to develop an AI-based platform for the public administration  to manage and perform administrative procedures. Such a platform could help users to express their needs and  qualify them in administrative terms using AI techniques to provi de personalized services . This platform should  be designed in such a way to follow and facilitate the user experience. However, i f AI technologies are used in  administrative procedures, the strategy mentions that citizens should always be aware about wheth er they are  talking to a civil servant or to a virtual assistant ; and that they should always be able to request assistance  from a human when they encounter errors or problems during the service.   Moreover , the strategy recognizes that the development of A I in the civil service will only be advantageous if  the working conditions for civil servants are improved. Any optimization of procedures h as to empower civil  servants,  enabling them to provide human assistance to those who need it. Therefore, there is a strong need to  train civil servants in digital tools  – including AI systems - and public communication . This training is also needed  in order to prevent subjective biases of automated procedures. Public authorities need skills in order to  understand and ta ckle any form of algorithmic discrimination.   The strategy highlights that currently only  a very small number of French  companies have the innovation  capabilities needed for AI development. At the same time, social enterprises and civil society organisatio ns only  receive a small amount of the investment s in AI which has consequences for AI -based innovation in these fields.  In order to improve the amount of AI in the social economy, public authorities should  launch programmes to  assist specific AI innovation  in the social sphere , such as the establishment of an AI -skills and resource hub for  actors working in social policy.   A selection of flagship projects using  AI in the public sector is presented in the strategy report , including :   A Chatbot providing easy access to regulations concerni ng Human Resources Management in the civil  service, developed by the Inter-ministerial Centre of Information Technology f or Human Resources.    A Chatbot to provide easier access to  the information system Chorus, developed by the  Financial  Information Systems of the Economic and Finance Department.    An AI system to detect fra ud in value declarations and to identify import trafficking developed by the  French customs agency.    AI systems against financial trafficking are used in the un it fighting against money laundering and the  financing of terrorism.  
  62   4.3.7  Lithuania   The Lithuanian government has published its AI strategy in 2019 as a continuation of an expert consultation  held in 2018. The AI strategy aims to communicate the current and f uture vision of AI in Lithuania as AI is  expected to be one of the main contributors to global economic growth. Given the potential of AI, the strategy  outlines a variety of actions to enhance the ethical and trustworthy development of AI in Lithuania in o rder to  minimize any potential risks or harm. The document sets out a variety of strategic recommendations to ensure  the utilization of the ec onomic potential of AI systems. Several of these recommendations include actions to be  taken for the uptake of AI technologies within the public sector.   In particular, i n order to establish ethical and legal core principles for the development and use of AI, the  Lithuanian strategy aims to establish an AI ethics committee which is tasked with reviewing the impact of this  technology on fundamental rights. Among other tasks , this committee will also foster the development of AI related skills in the public administration.   Another section in the strategy is dedicated to stimulating the integration of AI systems in economic sectors in  which the strategy makes a distinction be tween the public and the private sector. The strategy mentions that  AI promises a unique set of advantages for the public sector as it enables a lift in the wellbeing of citizens.  However, the document highlights that among the obstacles for adopting AI in  the public sector are the barriers  to innovation. Public institutions are slower to adopt new technologies due to a lack of funding or due to their   bureaucratic procedures. In order to tackle this challenge, the strategy suggests that the public sector ha s to  adopt a culture of innovation, especi ally with regards to using AI. This should enable the promotion of AI  solutions to be developed and tested.   Other mechanisms to increase the use of AI systems in the public sector include:    The development of a reg ulatory sandbox to allow the use and testing of AI in the public sector for a  limited time frame. Such a testing environment should enable  to try out AI in a live environment and  facilitate the definition of  which solution should be integrated on a larger scale ;   Public institutions will also be supported  in implementing AI systems that assist cit izens or improve  workflow, but details on  how this will be done  are not included;    An AI Advisory Board will be established to assist the government in the  decisions on future AI policy ;   New public -private partnerships will be created in order to establish better conditions for the development  of AI systems.   As most of the national strategies, Lithuania also underscores that AI requires a significant amount of accessible  and high -quality data. The higher the quality of the dataset, the more precise the AI system will be. However,  within the government context, it is recognised that frequently data is captured by different administrations  and fragmented, limit ing accessibility. The public sector, therefore, should create a unified approach to data  management which is favourable for the use in AI systems. It is therefore suggested that a data maturity model  is to be introduced so that  all public institutions could improve their data management.   Improving the data quality standard of public sector data goes hand in hand with the other plan to improve the  open data ecosystem of Lithuania. The strategy highlights in fact that a centralized hub for data in the publi c  sector might be establ ished,  to improve the accessibility of  public data and to enable standards for data literacy.   The strategy also proposes a number  of actions to create this AI-friendly data environment , including :   Creating sandbox environments whic h help open public sector data for AI and to provide access to public  data for individuals and organisations that want to develop AI  solutions .    Establish ing dedicated funding for public sector data management plans to promote enforcement of data  standards , furthering the environment of AI development and educating institutions on data literacy.    Promoting and facilitating the collaboration between data scientists and experts to work toget her with the  Lithuanian’s data team in order to cr eate the data manag ement model of the government.   4.3.8  Luxembourg   Luxembourg has released its AI strategy in May 2019 as AI is considered  a national priority for Luxembourg  and it is regarded as a high potential technology with far -reaching potential consequences for Luxembourg,   both positive and negative.  In this perspective, t he strategy aims to make sure that AI is built for people and 
  63   ensures that everyone investing, working and living in Luxembourg is able to benefit fully from these new  technologies and from the digitalization of the country .  Digitalization is seen as a driver for the productivity of the economy  but, the strategy mentions, solely pursuing  economic goals is not sufficient. The government, therefore, aims to follow a human -centric approach to ch ange  the private, professional and public life of citizens. AI could simplify many citizen -to-government interactions  which will result in timesaving, increased transparency , and more customer -oriented services.   The strategy recognises the importance  of AI -enabled solutions to contribute to better public services for  citizens and has a specific section devoted to AI for the public sector. It is mentioned that Luxembourg has  already invested in eGovernment initiatives and has been investing in multilingual s olutions to serve as the  groundwork for any future AI application in support of public service s.  AI thus follows the existing development of administrative simplification currently already ongoing in  Luxembourg. I t is expected that AI technologies can enha nce the accessibility and availability of public services  while enabling bet ter, cheaper and faster administrative procedures . This, in turn, should stimulate positive  social impacts either directly, through public service delivery, or indirectly , by assis ting SMEs as they have less  administrative burden from the government.   To ensure that AI-enabled public services can provide benefits to citizens , a number of actions will be take n,  such as :   Developing a comprehensive overview of potential projects based on criteria such as feasibility, necessity  and value , to create human -centric AI solutions for citizens ;   Engaging with other EU member states in peer -learning while also considering the exchange of best  practices, experience s and data ;   Contributing to the development of AI solutions , in order to build more efficient and personalized public  administration services that serve all parts of society ;   Supporting Digital by Default with AI tools that can ease its implementation, reinforce customer -oriented  service s, and provide tailor -made and integrative products/services to better engage Luxembourg’s  diverse, multilingual and multicultural society ;   Fostering research and innovation that assess AI systems for the public sector; deve loping expertise  combined with C ivic-Tech applications , and disseminating results and questions to the public ;   Studying the creation of a structured public database ecosystem aimed at eliminating technical barriers  for AI use cases.   4.3.9  Malta   The Government of Malta has published its AI Strategy  in October 2019. The main goal  of the strategy is to  transform the potential of AI into a major contributor to the economic  growth in digital innovation of  Malta. By  having the national strategy in place, Malta aspires to become the ‘Ultimate AI L aunchpad ’, meaning  that it  aims to become a place where local and foreign companies can develop, prototype, test and scale AI. The  conditions in Malta should allow these organisation s to spring board from Malta to the world.   The strategy recognizes  that AI can play a significant role in the transformation of government and  in improving  the way public services are delivered and infrastructure s are deployed. AI is seen to have the potential to make  governments more efficient by improving internal operations an d governance  processes , thus making better  use of taxpayer’s money.   As a matter of fact , the strategy highlight s that AI can improve almost everything a government does and  enables new choices in the way services are delivered. Hence, the Maltese governme nt intends  to stimulate AI  adoption in the public administration, to create an AI -powered government aligned with the current  plans for  the digital transformation of the public sector.   This objective to create the AI -powered government is supported by a va riety of actions , including :   Exploring  how AI can be deployed in different areas of the public administration. Each ministry’s Chief  Information Officers will be tasked with this exploration ;   Launching various  awareness campaigns for public officials in or der to increase understanding of AI, why  it is important and why the public sector should adopt this technology. Events will be held for all senior  officials in the public sector so to build deeper insight s into the AI Strategy ; 
  64    Updating e xisting public se rvice training c urricula to include AI -related courses. Public officials who wish  to obtain (external) certifications in AI will benefit from  financial support. In addition, a training and  awareness programme for procurement with AI will be developed for the public administration  procurement teams ;   Developing a guidance document with AI use case applications and a checklist as a reference for new AI  project proposals ;   Drafting a  technical policy statement to assist the adoption of AI for government services ;   Establishing a Technical Committee to review the architecture of solutions which are going to be  implemented within the government ;   Changin g the public procurement processes in order to support the procurement of emerging technologies  such as AI.     The strategy also lists several high -profile AI projects which are expected to have a large and positive impact  on the Maltese society. These proj ects will play a key role in raising the visibility of the benefits that AI can  deliver to society and to business es. The envisaged  pilot projects are the following :   AI for traffic management: a project where it will be explored how AI can be incorporated into the traffic  control system(s) and Geographical Information Systems ( GIS) of Malta ;   AI in education: a project to develop an AI -powered adaptive learning system to help students achieve  better education outcomes and a project to develop a predictive sy stem to identify early school -leavers ;   AI in healthcare: a pilot project to explore the use of AI on the Pharmacy of Your Choice platform ;   AI for customer service: a pilot on the central government information platform to create an A I-driven  email assistan t for civil servants . At a later stage, a chatbot will be developed to assist citizens in obtaining  the information they are seeking ;   AI in tourism: a pilot will incorporate AI into the Digital Tourist Platform to suggest experiences for tourists  and to fo recast where tourists will go ;   AI for better utilities: a pilot will be undertaken where AI will be used to collect, organise and analyse data  to discover patterns of water and energy usage. Another pilot will use AI to develop predic tive maintenance  and s cenarios in utilities management and design of services at local and city level.     4.3.10  The Netherlands   The Dutch government has released its AI Strategy in October 2019. In the document , AI is regarded as a key  technology that ‘will transform the world ’, given the many social and economic oppor tunities of AI technologies  which can be appl ied in many sectors of society.   However, due to the possible risk of a winner -takes -all scenario, the Dutch strategy aims to stimulate the Dutch  development and usage o f AI in order to  avoid becoming too reliant on AI solutions from others . The strategy  will be adjusted on a yearly basis and different ministries will be monitoring and evaluating their actions. The  Dutch government will work intensively with  the Dutch AI -Coalition:  a community of businesses, government,  academic and knowledge institutions who will work together on tackling the various challenges of AI.   The strategy has a specific section devoted to government use of AI and the role of government is listed   throughout the report  as crucial . It is mentioned that AI could assist in tackling many of the current social  challenges and could improve many processes in government organisation s.   To this end , the Dutch strategy mentions that the government should exp lore in which domains AI could assist  public sector goals,  but it highlights that it should work with companies using AI to tackle current policy issues.  Good collaboration is needed in order to combine expertise and data from various sources.   As the potential of AI is considered  to improve governmental operations, the aim of the strategy is to enable  the government to implement these solutions. However, the adoption of AI in government needs  technical, legal,  ethical and organisation al expertis e and might require a complete rearrangement of existing processes or  organisational structures.  
  65   The strategy then lists a few actions that the government is proposing to enable this adoption:    In order to improve the knowledge and capacities of civil servants on AI, digital courses will be provided  by the governmental digitalization academy. Additionally, the Dutch government will search for public private partnerships to reinforce the knowledge inside governmental organisations ;   The Ministry of Internal Affairs together with the Dutch Enterprise Agency ( RVO) will develop an  implementation toolkit for innovative technologies. Together with the Association of Municipalities, they  will host meetings to share experiences of AI used in the public s ector ;   Technical experts meetings will be hosted by the Dutch government ;   The Dutch government aim s to actively participate in European initiatives on AI for the public sector;    The government is also aiming to learn from a few experiments and pilots on AI within the Dutch  government. A variety of initiated projects are listed in the report.   As the strategy focuses heavily on stimulating the public -private partnerships between the state and the private  sector, the Dutch government  will also use  innovative pr ocurement processe s to assist SME s in developing  innovative AI applications for the public sector. As an example, the strategy highlights the use of hackathons in  the justice domain to develop AI solutions for concrete policy issues.   A number of policy do mains where the Dutch government is exploring the use of AI or will stimulate other ac tors  to use AI in their fields are mention ed and are listed below :   The use of AI in the field of security and justice. The Dutch government plans to explore how AI could be  used in the police forces, the courts of law and in defence. The strategy mentions that AI is already being  used in the police and in the Ministry of Defence;    To stimulate the development of AI in the police, a National Police AI Lab  has been establishe d. This Lab  is planned to  conduct research on AI in the police force and to attract  talents to work for the national  police ;   The Ministry of Defence plans to conduct research  to discover the implications of AI for the defence  domain. Based on current experiences and knowledge on AI, the Ministry will develop a specific vision for  AI in defence ;   In connection with the legal and ethical challenges in the use of AI , the Ministry of Health will publish a  roadmap on AI in healthcare to assist relevant stakeholders  in using AI to improve the prevention of  diseases, to improve diagnos es, treatments and logistics ;   The Ministry for Agriculture will also explore how to  stimulate the use of AI in agriculture together with  social actors and the AI  Coalition, making investments to further develop the data  infrastructure for  agriculture.   For all the AI used in governmental organisation s, the Dutch government stresses that the algorithm s shoul d  be human -centric and trustworthy. Hence, the government will stimulate the use of AI Impact Assessment tools,  audits or certifications.   Moreover, i n all research activities, ethical considerations o n the use of AI must be  considered and a s eries of  design principles are being developed for specific use on AI systems in the judicial domain .  4.3.11  Portugal   The Portuguese government presented its national AI strategy  in April 2019. The document lays out the  amplifying effect AI will have on the proce ss of digitisation, recogniz ing the increasing impact and pace of  technology on the lives of people. Hence, the strategy aims to prepare the Portuguese economic, social and  cultural landscape on the coming AI Revolution.   The main general objectives of the  strategy are to include additional economic growth, establish scientific  excellence and to increase human development in an inclusive way. In addition, a clear vision on the impacts of  AI is aimed in order strengthen societal robustness. The strategy sugg ests stimulating ethical -by-design  methods to improve society and democracy with AI.   The strategy has a specific section devoted to the modernisation of the Portuguese public administration. In  this vein, AI and data science are considered  important tools  to provide better public services and to adopt  evidence -based approaches on  public policy design . By using and combining administrative data with other 
  66   external data, public policies and decision -making processes could be improved by supporting evidence informed choices  rather than policy based on intuition. Furthermore, using the massive amounts of data  currently at disposal of the  public administrations, it is possible to change the public s ervice provision from a  reactive  to an anticipatory approach . The strategy, therefore, aims to contribute to strengthening the scienti fic  and technological competenc es to deal with large amounts of data within the Portuguese public administration.   At the moment, there are 19 R&D projects funded through the ‘’Mobilising  programme to foster AI in public  administration’’, with 4 pilot projects between the R&D community and public administrations and 15 additional  projects selected from a scientific panel. There are plans to fund more projects in the future .  The strategy li sts some specific objectives , including :   Making administrative data easier to access by academic, public and private actors, while providing a  secure and privacy -protecting access;    Foster ing collaboration between public, private and academic organisation s concerning the use of AI;    Promot ing new and innovative solutions for the simplification of the public administration .   Reinforc ing public sector skills and capabilities with respect to AI and data science ;   Ensuring the ethical use of AI in public administration , including p ublic sector organisation s in the ethics  committee for AI .   In order to meet these objectives, the Portuguese government is planning to:    Develop a National Data Infrastructure that will act as a ce ntralized repository for administrative data.  This infrastructure will be managed by the National Statistics Office ;   Promote AI experiments,  new ideas and concepts through the cooperation of academic, private and public  sector organisation s;   Develop an eco system to increase the number  of companies, start -ups and government actor s benefitting  from collaborative  platforms ;   Create a  Collaborative Laboratory for AI in the Public  Administration and enhance the AI and data science  skill qualification programmes w ithin the public sector together with academic institutions .  4.3.12  Sweden   The Swedish Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation released its AI strategy , titled ‘The National Approach for AI’  in May 2018 . The strategy highlights that Sweden aims to be the world leader in harnessing the opportunities  presented by the digital transformation. AI is p art of this development and is  considered to have high potential  to contribute with significant benefits in a w ide variety of areas by increasing economic growth and contributing  to finding  solutions to environmental and social challenges. However, Sweden is aware of the need to create  the correct enabling conditions to make AI able to strengthen competi tiveness an d to enhance welfare. In  addition, the strategy mentions that AI has a considerable potential to contribute to a more effective and  relevant public sector. Hence, the strategy  aims to make Sweden a leader in harnessing the opportunities that  the use of AI can offer for the public sector.   The objectives and actions of using AI in the public sector are closely linked to the digital transformation goals  and the Digital Strategy of the Swedish Government. While the strategy acknowledges the potential of AI in the  public sector, there is neither any  specific section nor any dedicated  action aimed at stimulating AI use in the  public sector. Instead, the strategy mentions certain requirements and the wish to take specific  actions to  achieve them.   One of the condit ions to benefit from AI is that a sufficient number of people should have the skills required to  develop and use AI. This means that AI knowledge and expertise should be present throughout all of society,  including government agencies. This relevant AI kno wledge is not only for technical experts , but for all  professionals interacting with technology. Hence, the strategy highlights the need for strong collaborations  between private, public and academic sectors in AI.   Furthermore, AI can only create value whe n technology is widely used in the private and public sectors.  Therefore, it is in Sweden’s interest to stimulate innovative applications and the use in society in various ways.  In order to accelerate the introduction of AI, it is mentioned that Sweden nee ds pilot projects, testbeds and  environments for the development of AI in the public sector.  
  67   The strategy also recognises that there are ethical risks when AI is applied in the public sector. The u se of AI  should be transparent and should take into account  moral and legal issues . Sweden is planning to take the lead  in ethical, safe, secure and sustainable use of AI. The strategy requires the design of a n ethical and r egulatory  framework with principles, norms, standards and rules to balance fundamental need s for privacy, ethics, trust  and social protection with access to the data needed for AI . This is deemed important considering that t he  Swedish public sector already has a high amount of high -quality data that could be useful for the development  of AI, but  needs risk governance for data management, curation and use.    The strategy acknowledges the need for g uidelines and standards to guide private and public stakeholders ,  since AI standards have the potential to promote technical, semantic, legal and other f orms of interoperability  between public and private instit utions. As Sweden is a relatively small country, the strategy mentions the need   to develop partnerships and collaborations on the use of AI with other countries, especially within the EU.   4.3.13  United Kin gdom   The United Kingdom has released its ‘AI Sector Deal ’ in May 2019. In this  policy paper, AI is pre sented as one  of the Grand Challenges of the UK, and is considered  as having the potential to solve complex problems in a  fast way, freeing up time , and raising productivity. In order to realise all the social and econo mic benefits, the  UK mentions the need for  a strong partnership between business, academia and government.   The strategy is built on five foundations: ideas, people, infrastructure, the business environment , and places.  While the strategy focuses on the i ndustrial uptake of AI, there are a number of policy actions mentioned with  regards to the public sector. The use of AI in the public sector is seen as a way to better deliver digital pub lic  services. A new Government Office for AI, responsible for overseeing the strategy  implementation, is planned  to be established .  The strategy also highlights the need to have the right digital infrastructure in order to meet AI-related  ambitions . This d igital infrastructure is highlighted as physical, but also in terms of data infrastructure. This is  why the UK government is already making public datasets open. Significant  challenges , however, are highlighted   in sharing private -sector datasets and the st rategy proposes  to explore how to enable the sharing of private  datasets  between private organisations and the public sector. In particular, t he UK government is exploring  a  data sharing framework called Data Trusts to protect sensitive data, facilitate ac cess, and ensure accountability ,  addressing  different barriers to sharing data together with major data holders in the private and public sectors.  Moreover, the strategy includes  plans to enhance the existing data infrastructure to publish more high -quality  public data in an easily findable and reusable format needed for machine learning. Legal certainty will be  provided over the sharing and use of data with the Data Protection Bi ll.  Finally, i n order to stimulate the uptake of AI within the public sector, the strategy plans to create a 20 million  GovTech Fund to support businesses and to provid e government with innovativ e solutions for public services,  while assisting the growth o f the UK’s GovTech Sector. In addition, the R&D spending across the public and  private sector will be increased. The industry is expected to work closely with the government through the AI  Council to tackle data ethics questions and the role of AI in the p ublic sector.   4.3.14  Summary of the overview   Summing up, the analysis of AI national strategies reveals a wide variety of initiatives and techniques  that Member States are putting in place or intend to put in place to foster the use of AI in the public  sector , both directly and indirectly.   Using the vocabulary of a classic categorisation  of different policy instruments (Bemelmans -Videc et al., 1998)   into ‘sticks ’ (i.e., regulatory instruments), ‘carrots ’ (i.e., economic and financial instruments ), and ‘sermons ’ (i.e.,  soft policy instruments, such as training and dissemination programmes), we can observe that, for the time  being, the emerging national strategies on AI in the public sector in Europe seem to privilege a ‘sermon approach ’  over sticks and carrots. Soft policy instruments, such as campaigns for awareness, encouragements to improve  data quality, and employee training, are in fact prevalent across almost all countries . Regulation and financial  resource allocation, such as project funding and procurement  process reviews, on the other hand, are  instruments that are less uniformly distributed at this stage.   This overview of national approaches to fostering the implementation and use of AI in the public sector is a  snapshot of a swiftly developing scenario, which is very likely to transform over time. However, such an attempt  to capture the ‘spirit of time ’ of European initiatives for AI in the public sector can serve as a practical first step  to systematically assess potential impacts of AI in public service s in the European Union.   
  68   5 Assessing the impact of AI in public services in the EU   5.1 Theoretical underpinnings of AI use in the public sector   As we know, digitalization is not anymore an emergent phenomenon but the actual shape of everyday life  interactions and transactions. Within this context, as we have already emphasised (see §1.1 and throughout  this report ), AI has taken the stage in the la st three years after a historical presence in academic research, and  it is often overlapped with digital innovation, tout court  (Viscusi et al, forthcoming).47 Thus, in this report we  consider AI as another kind of ICT -enabled innovation, having its own cha racteristics, yet not independent from  the ICT capabilities developed for previous configurations of digital government and governance. In this  perspective, for each digital governance configuration there is a type of innovation attitude within the public  sector that can be identified for the considered domain of intervention, as described in Figure 14.  According to the typology, ICT -enabled innovations can produce changes in governance processes in four ways:  Technical/Incremental change; Organisation al/Sustained change (both clustered as Type I change); and   Transformative/Disruptive change; Transformat ive/Radical change (both clustered as Type II change)  (Misuraca,  2012 and Misuraca & Viscusi, 2015) . We have already met and operationalised these four types of innovation  potential in §2.2.4  while analysing the 230 cases in our census of AI initiatives.     FIGURE 14 TYPOLOGY OF CHANGES  FOR EXPLOITING ICT -ENABLED INNOVATION P OTENTIAL  (MISURACA AND VISCUS I, 2015)   What the figure above tells us is that technical/incremental change (or the automation of existing service and  administrati ve routines and tasks) is probably the first step of an idealistic transition process, focused on the  improvement of efficiency of internal governance mechanisms (Change I Type – bottom left box). It is therefore  not very surprising that an overwhelming ma jority of observed cases (127 out of 2 30) actually stays on this  step according to our interpretation. 48  However, the second step of this transition can go in two possible directions, exemplified by the arrows: either  the further reinforcement of Change I Type (bottom right box) with a growing attention to effectiveness rather  than merely efficiency in performance, or the jump to Change II Type (top left box) with the immediate result  of opening up internal governance mechanisms with a more outward looking approach (e.g. using AI solutions  to add a further source of relevant information on what service users think, do, etc .). With all the caveats related  to the way our database was created, it is quite significant to note here that 58 cases be long to the bot tom  right and 42  to the top left cluster.   Finally, the ideal landing point of this transition process is to possibly achieve the top right box where a more  pronounced external (networked) orientation of the governance system is coupled with the achievement  of  concrete results in terms of organisational effectiveness in performing its own duties. In our census, only 3                                              47 See also the TRIGGER Project for a ‘deep dive’ on AI and digital innovation - https://trigger -project.eu/   48 See the mapping analysis done in §2.3 above.   
  69   initiatives belong to this cluster. Compared with the bottom right box, the resulting innovation is not only  sustained at organisational level , but also transformative with respect to the underlying governance model.  Compared with the top left box, we are entitled to speak of inclusion rather than merely consideration of  contributions coming from the outside of the organisations. In this sense a lso goes the terminology, with a  peculiar use of the term ‘disruptive ’ – as distinct from ‘radical ’ – that is more attuned to the original meaning  by Christensen (1997)  as elaborated in detail by Misuraca (2012)  building  on King and Tucci (2002) .   A systematic use of AI in fact - starting with low -risk applications i n service delivery - could also pave the way  for citizen feedback and engagement and enhance the use of emerging digital tools. With increased interaction  with AI, and by building upon existing modernization efforts, government delivery of public services could soon  mirror the ways citizens interact with technology in their personal lives. Implementation of and use of AI in  public services may also become an indicator of how the public sector can leverage other emerging digital tools.  As we know however, AI  raises questions around privacy, the accelerating pace and adoption of digital tools,  and whether humans can keep pace with the rate of automation overtime.   In the paper by Misuraca and Viscusi (2015) the figure is borrowed from, while it certainly is the more intense  use of ICT s that supports, facilitates or complements existing efforts to improve governance mechanisms, other  ‘softer ’ elements (e.g. cultural or socio -political or knowledge and skills related) come into play to d etermine  the transition from Typ e I to Type II Change and within the latter, from disruptive to radical transformation of  public service, policy and administration. Such elements become essential to consider at the ‘meso ’ level of  abstraction – away from the specific government/g overnance process, in a more reflective attitude towards a  strategic decision such as that of moving from one box to another – where the picture is positioned in.   As a consequence of the above discussion, it is worth emphasizing here that the framework ass umes as key  argument that ICT-enabled innovation cannot be decoupled from public administration reform   (Misuraca et al., 2011; Misuraca & Viscusi, 2014, 2015) , thus encompassing public services and their impact on  welfare and citizens satisfaction (Larsson & Grönlund, 2014) .   The same line of reason ing can be applied at the meso level to the evolution of the government interests toward  the adoption of AI solutions through dedicated innovation initiatives. These would eventually move from simply  accompanying or supporting existing systems to actually substituting them. Just to make an example of current  chronicle, this would imply leveraging smart cities and digital initiatives to control and contain the spreading of  epidemics among the population (Normile, 2020; Strickland, 2020) .    In this regard, it is worth noting that innovation and advance in digital systems (e.g., thr ough AI) and networked  governance may enable bottom -up welfare state initiatives that may be produced and promoted by non -state  actors governmental organisation s, and enlarge the scope of most AI -enabled initiatives in the public sector . To  the extent that  the initiatives mapped in this report are still mainly focused on performance as a value driver  and on a type of innovation that is mainly technical and can be associated with incremental changes and/or  early adoption phases, this adds a further dimension  to the policy efforts of governments and other state  institutions.   Indeed, state institutions are often not aligned with the need for knowledge capital change required to fully  exploit the effects of digitalization (and AI in particular). As a result, they risk to exclude people without personal  means and capabilities, such as, e.g., workers raised within the framework of social protection typical of the  industrial production model of the second half of the 20th century, who are facing the challenges of  digitalized  social services often without adequate skills and digital literacy (Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008; Hargittai et al.,  2019; Helsper, 2016) .  It is worth noting that the degree of maturity of the systems (both at digital and government levels (Andersen  et al., 2012; Pereira & Serrano, 2020)  is an i nput to the framework outlined here and may also enable different  networked governance configurations; these latter correspond to various degrees of openness  or inclusion   reached by the public sector as well as the participation of the citizens. Consequent ly, the different digital  governance systems have different impacts on the governance configuration of the stakeholders’ networks ,  which may require or enforce innovation to a given context and for certain governance models characteristics.   Moreover, thos e systems and platforms represent the point where openness,  generativity , and specific   affordances  (Nambisan et al., 2019)  involved in the int eractions with citizens make the point of change in the  use of ICTs from e -government to ‘digital ’ government. As pointed out by (Loonam et al., 2018)  ‘these new  digital technolo gies embrace ICT systems such as virtualization, mobility, and analytical systems and are  integrated with back ‑office ICT s’, thus moving from a focus on the management of ICT infrastructure to ‘the  interface with or fully on the side of customers ’ (Matt et al., 2015)  or citizens in the case of public administration.  
  70   In light of the above considerations, the need emerges to further advance an interpretati ve  methodological framework  that can model and simulate – on the one hand - the macro and meso elements  enacting digital systems and their related networked governance configurations, and provide an instrument that  - on the other hand – can capture the pos sible impacts (constraints/enablers) on knowledge capital and  employment status changes of the choices made at macro and meso levels and instantiated in public sector  reforms supported by AI initiatives. As a consequence, the different scenarios for AI imp act in public services  may require or enforce innovation in a given context and to certain governance model characteristics.   Research and policy debates acknowledge great potential to recent advances in AI in combination with the  continuous datafication o f our societies, enabling the possibility of gathering and processing large volumes of  data from social processes. However, in general, AI is regarded as systems that perform human -like cognitive  functions, often by making predictions, recommendations and decisions (OECD, 2019) . What makes AI different  from earlier technological waves is its ability to delegate decision -making authority, rather than to solely provide  information (Latzer & Just, 2020) . This, combined with its common deployment in the core functions and  processes of public administrations. could significantly change how governments choose to govern and serve  their population (Engstrom et al., 2020; Mehr, 2017) .   Nevertheless, apart from what could seem an attention to public and social value s (also related to the  complementary flourishing of initiatives on p roviding ethical guidelines,  as we have seen extensively in Section  4), AI has been largely considered as a way to improve economic performance, and only recently researchers  have started investigating and problematizing the adoption of AI as a way to improve public administration  operations and service delivery, as well as  considering its general role in public sector transformation (Desouza  et al., 2020) , and the consequent challenges for governance (Sun & Medaglia, 2019) .   In this perspective, the use of AI has led many to emphasize its potential transformative effect on society by  disrupting the labour market (Lewis et al., 2018)  causing challenges in accountability (Vogl et al., 2019) ,  amplifying risks in privacy through large scale data collection (Power, 2016)  and increasing inequalities in our  societies through biased decision -making algorithms (Pasquale, 2015) . Others highlight that despite these risks,  AI could yield large benefits to society by improving efficiency, productivity, decision -making and creating more  valuable and meanin gful jobs (Gasser & Almeida, 2017; Vinuesa et al., 2020) .   In the public sector, AI technologies have been argued to be highl y impactful, as they are seen as great tools to  tackle resource scarcity, create new ways of engaging with citizens, automate processes, personalize public  service delivery, improve internal management, fight corruption and generally improve the quality of  decisions  in policy making (OECD, 2019; Mehr, 2017; Wirtz 2019). In the healthcare sector in particular, there are high  expectations for AI, as the recent pandemic crisis is showing, with a race towards finding the AI -enabled solution  to manage the respon se to the COVID -19 emergency. Indeed, AI could assist in healthcare research and  development, providing faster and more accurate diagnoses, supporting predictions of diseases and treatments,  as well as the diffusion of healthcare expertise where medical ca pacity might be scarce (Jiang et al., 2017) .   Nevertheless, there is limited conclusive evid ence on the real impacts of AI  in public services , and many  claims of AI effects are solely based on technical assessments of the algorithms in controlled environments  that do not represent the real world. For example, a recent review of AI in breast cancer highlighted that the  claims of AI solutions are often inflated and n ot as accurate in real life as vendors claim (Sadoughi et al., 2018) .  Despite existing challenges in assessing the true abilities of AI – as it is likely that the accuracy of AI solutions  will somewhat increase in the comin g years – a more fundamental challenge lies in the difficulties of adopting  and using AI solutions within the public sector, as anticipated in Section 2 , and in line with consolidated  literature on the implementation of (innovative) technologies in public administration, well established within  the eGovernment research field (Gil-Garcia et al., 2014) . Literature on digital transformation – both in the  private and the public sector – demonstrate instead that achieving successful ICT -enabled transformation,  whether it includes AI or other technologies, is more a social, or ganisational and political challenge ,  rather than a technological one (Hinings et al., 2018; Vial, 2019) .  As illustrated by Wirtz et al., 2019 in a recent literature review, four major dimensions are limiting the use of  AI in the public sector: technology, l aws, ethics and social factors.  In comparison with the private sector – where  businesses have deployed initiatives to change their infrastructure, governance, and business models to create  and exploit value from their digital as sets – the public sector is still tied up to a consideration of technology as  something separated from public sector reform and policy making. Accordingly, the focus is still preeminent on  what can be considered the eGovernment rhetoric legacy , namely that  the provision of ICT -enabled services  mainly involves the translation of administrative procedures in digital format.  
  71   Taking these issues into consideration, especially in the research area of eGovernment (Dwivedi et al., 2019)   quite a few scholars have commonly engaged in identifying key themes in the state of the art literature i n order  to outline research agendas emphasizing both challenges and opportunities of AI. In particular, Sun & Medaglia,  2019 have pointed out those related to decision -making in the public sector ‘where environmental variables are  constantly changing, and pre-programming cannot account for all possible cases ’ (p. 370), thus further  questioning the way policy makers frame and legitimise AI -supported solutions.   To illustrate the dynamics emerging from the changing nature of the public sector in the digital a ge, we can  refer to the recent work of (Andersen et al., 2020) . In this conceptual article the authors argue that, contrasting  the political ambitions on the next generation of government, the  uptake of technology can lead to digital  sclerosis , characterized by stiffening of the governmental processes, failure to respond to changes in demand,  and decreasing innovation feedback from workers. In this regard, they outline three early warnings of d igital  sclerosis: decreased bargaining and discretion power of governmental workers, enhanced agi lity and ability at  shifting, extended proximities,  and the so-called panopticonization . To respond proactively and take preventive  care initiatives, policy ma kers and systems developers need to be sensitized about the digital sclerosis, prepare  the technology, and design intelligent augmentations in a flexible and agile approach, as depicted in Figure  15.    FIGURE 15 DIGITAL SCLEROSIS V S GOOD GOVERNANCE (A NDERSEN ET AL., 2020 )  As a guiding principle for the entire stream of research on AI in public services, and to be particularly considered  in the elaboration of the proposal for developing a methodology for impact assessment, we consider the need  to integrate a public value per spective  by looking at the ‘value drivers ’ informing current initiatives and  strategies of AI use  in public services. As anticipated, this will be further elaborated building on the body of  research that has questioned the different types of values in eGov ernment initiatives (e.g. Bannister & Connolly,  2014)  and the general adoption of ICTs for the public sector innovation (e.g  Misuraca & Viscusi, 2015) .   The values at play in the public sector adoption of ICTs have been a subject of research and practical interest  for the scholars in the field of public sector management and eG overnment, far before the current hype on AI  (e.g. Bozeman, 2007 ; or Cordella and Bonina, 2012). Although most of the debate has be en polarized around  the concept of public value, some authors have focused on identifying frameworks for understan ding the  specific impact of ICTs  on public sector values and on its reforms, where an emphasis has been often put on  the difference between pu blic value and new public management perspectives.   This debate has been further moved to the realm of AI, by (Toll et al., 2019)  who have used the ‘ideals ’ making  up ‘value positions ’ toward the eGovernment initiatives, identified as professionalism, efficiency, service, and  engagement by (Rose et al., 2015) , to anal yse the values exhibited in the AI policy documents in Sweden. In this  respect, an important element to consider, especially for assessment of value drivers and AI, is what Bozenam  identifies as ‘citizen’s public values ’ and the need for further research o n ‘the degree of consensus required to  consider a value as a public value ’ (Bozeman, 2007, p6) .49                                              49 Notwithstanding the vast number of contributions on values, as highlighted by Viscusi et al, (forthcoming), it is worth notin g that not  only an ‘identificatio n problem’ still exists but, especially for AI, principles and values have been often overlapped or used interchangeably  in the state of -the-art literature as well as in the current landscape of AI strategies and ethical guidelines proliferation.   
  72   5.2 Towards a methodological fra mework to assess AI impacts in public services   As anticipated in §1.2, the AI Watch is devoted to providing an overview and analysis of the use and impact of  AI in public services by assessing the most relevant examples available in the state of the art. I t also has among  its objectives to develop a methodology to identify risks and opportunities, drivers, and barriers of the use AI in  public service provision.   Taking the issues discussed in §5.1 into account, should eventually help governments in better c reating and  capturing value from AI applications and in understanding how public sector organisation s adapt to changes in  complex environments as the ones introduced by AI to improve public services delivery.   In fact, most research studies and policy documents dealing with potential benefits and known challenges are  not backed by empirical findings showing evidence of uptake of AI applications in the public sector, especially  in the specific context of service operations and related ecosystems. Literature and practice in the field also  show that even when AI technologies are adopted by governmental institutions, it is still unclear what changes  are effectively introduced into the organisational structures and ad ministrative processes, a clear requirement  for any innovation to create value in the public sector.   Early findings of our state of the art analysis show that identifying the key dimensions of the use of AI in  public services is crucial  to ultimately set the ground for building tools for Member States to help assessing  the suitability and impact of their approach, and allow for better goal -setting and benchmarking.   Therefore, in this sub -section we define the basic elements of a generic framework to asses s different drivers  and barriers to AI implementation in government, in order to understand the potential impacts of its usage.   The exploratory research conducted so far confirms that many factors influencing public sector transformation  also play a role in the adoption of AI and the realisation of organisational change in government and governance.  However, for the special case of AI more attention is required to the issues of data quality, data maintenance,  data sharing and to the general maturity of dig ital economy and society (van Noordt & Misuraca, forthcoming.)    To further advance in the d irection of understanding the positive and negative consequences of AI take up on public administration and service delivery , a broader modelling effort is being conducted in parallel  to this work, to develop a comprehensive approach to prioritize the focu s areas in analysing the use and added  value of AI -enabled innovation.50 The expected result of this ongoing research is to develop a sound proposal  of a suitable and robust methodology to assess potential social and economic impacts of the use of AI to  support public services, with an analysis of the opportunities, threats, key enablers and barriers for  implementation emerging from its application to a selected number of case studies.   While it is out of the scope of this document to enter into the details of the proposed modelling exercise, which  will be further elaborated in the next phase of the research, we anticipate here some of the foundations on  which it is being thought and that will be proposed for further consultation and peer -learning debate.   The first substantive task that is being carried out includes the definition of the data gathering  requirements for further mapping initiatives in EU Member States  and identify case studies for in -depth  analysis of the social economic impact of AI in public s ervices (achieved or expected).   A first category of requirements can be derived from the shared European values embodied in public  services . A good starting point can be Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union, which defines the values  on which the Union is founded and are common to the Member States as ‘a society in which pluralism, non discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity an d equality between women and men prevail ’51  An additional set of shared European values (rights and freedoms) is defined by the Charter of Fundamental  Rights of the European Union52 and only apply in cases where Member States implement EU regulation directly   or transpose it into national legislation. Some rights and freedoms, such as the right to data protection and to  a transparent administration, are particularly relevant for our framework.   Opinion surveys53 conducted among citizens of the EU indicate differ ences in the way in which they recognize  and identify with these values. The differences are not only between the Member States, but also within each                                              50 This pa rt of the research is being conducted by JRC with the support of TNO - The Netherlands Institute for Applied Scientific  Research  as part of the study for Scientific support to the development of a methodology to assess social and economic impacts of the  use of Artificial Intelligence to support public service, funded by under the ELISE Action of the ISA2 Programme managed by JRC for DIGIT.   51 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2bf140bf -a3f8-4ab2 -b506 -fd71826e6da6.0023.02/DOC_1&format=PDF    52 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf    53 https://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/p ublicopinion/archives/eb/eb77/eb77_value_en.pdf   
  73   country, between different demographic categories, including age, education, income, social position. Thes e  differences would have to be taken into account in the actual implementation of specific AI applications in  public services.   A second important category of requirements and corresponding indicators reflect values and norms of  public administration . Trad itionally focusing on principles of good public administration, in recent years they  have come to reflect the increasing technological (digital) character of the delivery of public services as well as  the increased privatization of traditionally public tas ks. These two developments in particular demand additional  standards for good governance (e.g. of citizens’ personal data and public or shared resources including open  data, computing infrastructures, algorithms, etc).   In defining the requirements correspo nding to good public administration, further inspiration can be drawn from  existing sets of principles, such as the Principles of Public Administration developed by OECD -SIGMA in close  co-operation with the European Commission54. They help (aspiring or acce ding) Member States in evaluating  the functioning of their public administrations through providing detailed requirements for a number of core  areas. In addition, they outline a methodological framework for the Principles of Public Administration which  provides measures of each principle, focusing on implementation.   As previously mentioned, for EU regulation transposed or directly adopted into national legislation the right to  good administration is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU55 where, in particular, the  requirements outlined in Article 41 are highly relevant for algorithmic applications.   A third category of requirements and indicators reflects the political priorities and ambitions, national and  international, with regard to the use of AI in the provision of public services . They may be expressed  in international documents, such as the EU White paper on AI or the OECD AI principles referred to above, in  national AI strategies and other relevant policy documents. However, as we hav e seen in Section 4 , not all  Member States have finalized their national AI strategies and fewer still have explicitly defined strategies or  guidelines to address the specific needs of uses of AI in the delivery of public services. However, most of the  documents examined make explicit references to their expectations relating to AI applications in public services.   Building on the analysis provided in Section 4 , we can argue that despite a shared European ambition with  regard to AI in general and AI applicat ions in the public services in particular, the various policy documents  reveal differences between Member States. Although the requirements in general are similar, the priority given  to individual requirements differs. One assumption is that the difference s in priorities stem from differences in  readiness, in terms of available digital assets, skills, funding, or other factors. This would suggest that  customized ways to assess the social and economic impact would have to apply, which will require ‘deep dive s’  at country level or in specific cases in policy domains.   Finally, an important category deserving attention is that of the negative requirements for AI in the public  sector , defined as a precaution, in response to perceived potential risks; or to a negative impact with its  unexpected consequences. This category of requirements is linked closely with anticipated or already known  undesired outcomes and impacts of AI applicatio ns for the delivery of public services. These  requirements define  what applications should not do, and can vary from general to specific. A few examples may include the  requirement to eliminate bias in data used to train algorithms; the need of forbidding discrimination in  algorithmic decision -making or of setting upper limits for error rates, false positives/negatives, or standard  deviations of algorithms. This is already being considered in some Member States approaches, such as the  French legislative ini tiative to limit or forbid56 the use of legaltech to analyse and predict the judicial ruling and  behaviour of judges and jury, or emerging law cases such as SyRi - System for Risk Indication, in The  Netherlands (already discussed in Section 3) ; or the case regarding the use of facial recognition in a school in  Sweden. In addition, there are also preventive administrative measures, such as the decision of the Belgian  police regulator to forbid piloting the use of face recognition technology at the Zaventem ai rport57 ; or the  negative advice by the French data protection regulator regarding two pilots using facial recognition technology  in French schools58; or the cease and desist letter issued by the French data protection regulator to the French  Ministry of the  Interior regarding the use of Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems 59                                              54 http://www.sigmaweb.org/publications/principles -public -administration.htm   55 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf    56 The French Justice Reform Act, Article 33,  https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do;jsessionid=98B09D0394DAE57F1618DC21F30405F6.tplgfr34s_1?idArticle=JORFAR TI 000038261761&categorieLien=id&cidTexte=JORFTEXT000038261631&dateTexte =   57 https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/09/20/politie -mag-geen-automatische -gezichtsherkenning -gebruiken -op-de   58 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/experimentation -de-la-reconnaissance -faciale -dans-deux-lycees -la-cnil-precise -sa-position    59 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/radars -troncons -mise-en-demeure -du-ministere -de-linterieur   
  74   In our initial framework it is thus proposed to consider the multiple elements of AI in public services that can  be grouped into macro -areas labelled as: Digital Infrastruct ure, Organisation al Resources, Digital Government  Development and Digital Society Development, as described in Figure 16 below.     FIGURE 16 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWOR K FOR AI IMPACT IN P UBLIC SERVICES      In light of the above and in line with the perspective advanced, our research will thus reflect on the technological,  legal, economic and social implications derived specif ically from the use of AI as well as on the barriers that  may prevent the full exploitation of the AI potential in the public sector. To this end, the approach proposed  aims to empirically assess the impact of AI on public services, taking into considerati on key dimensions relevant  in evaluating the impact of AI in public services, as well as its potential, unintentional or unexpected, effects.   5.3 Proposed approach for modelling and assessing impact of AI in public services   The development of the methodology proposal takes into consideration some of the most advanced insights of  the theory of public sector innovation to explain the adoption and implementation of new technological  developments in the public sector. This will enable the identification and empiri cal validation and monitoring of  opportunities, threats, key enablers and barriers for implementation of AI in public services in European  countries.   Developing and extending the proposed conceptual framework, an operational toolkit can ultimately be  delivered to support ex ante  and ex post  analysis and monitoring of the effects of introducing AI in public sector  organisations. Also, a system of common indicators can be defined, which will be further operationalised into a  proposal for modelling impact ass essment of AI in public services .   To achieve this specific aim, t he research is structured into 3 sub -tasks  as part of the activity of scientific  support that TNO is conducting for JRC , as indicated in the  Figure 17 below that shows the overall approach  for proposed for developing the methodology for impact assessment.

  75     FIGURE 17 OVERVIEW OF THE MET HODOLOGICAL APPROACH  PROPOSED     5.3.1  Structural features driving AI adoption in public sector and services   The first step of this part of the research is to identify opportunities, threats, key enablers and barriers for  implementation of AI in public services, based on further review of liter ature and analysis of practices emerged  from the mapping. In parallel the research will produce a first estimation of the likely effects on the public  services (for example social impacts such as better and more tailored services to citizens and economic i mpacts  such as productivity, employment and growth).   In line with the theoretical orientations briefly described in §5.1, the proposed approach starts from a simple  premise: that all policy interventions are about modelling human behaviour - to be changed or maintain  unchanged compared to a given initial state relating to a specific issue, context, time and target population.  Any impact assessment approach is thus context - and time -specific .   Recent efforts to create and apply more realistic models of impac t assessment put the behaviour of actors and  their interactions in the system at the centre of their analysis to understand the emergent properties of  technology diffusion and their effects in a group and society (Rai & Robinson, 2015; Schlüter et al., 2017) .  In this perspective, we suggest to examine the impacts of AI in public services as the public value  perceived by the actors engaged in service provision  (government agencies, private actors) and those  receiving the service (citizens). These actors - govern ment, businesses and citizens - are the primary agents  that will perceive the public value generated by the implementation of AI in the provision of public services.60   In general, public value is considered the variable to optimise in the provision of publ ic services. According to  Moore (1995) public value is understood as the collective expectations with regard to public services provision .  In defining expected outcomes in terms of public values we will use the taxonomy of perceived social value of  ICT app lications in public services provision proposed recently by (Twizeyimana & Andersson, 2019) . This  taxonomy is merged and operated within the model presented below.   The trans formative capacity of innovations enabled by new digital technologies is contingent on their adoption  across a given sector. In turn, adoption and implementation of AI in the public sector depends on at least:    the extent to which the adoption of AI in the delivery of public services is regarded by the government,  the civil society and the private sector as generating social and economic benefits;    the extent to which citizens, the policy and regulatory environme nts, and the private sector support the  uptake of AI in the delivery of public services;    the level of resources available for the adoption of AI in the public sector (i.e. aggregated demand,  financial resources, knowledge and skills);    the ability of admi nistrative and infrastructural legacy systems to accommodate the substitution of  current means of delivering public services for new, AI -enabled ones.                                                 60 In the conceptualization of the embeddedness of artificial intelligence in the provision of services the citizen or business can be expected  to have little insights a s to the role of AI in the provision of services (i.e., its effects in the provision of services of given AI algorithm).    Task 1:  Definition of  structural characteristics  of AI adoption drivers  and effects on soceity  and economy  Task 2: Scenarios of AI  adoptions that optimize  effects on society and  economy  Task 3:  Scenarios  potential impacts on  environment, society   and economy   Task 4: Expert group consultation  
  76   There is a growing body of literature into factors affecting the adoption and implementation of ICTs in  public  services and eGovernment, in particular using the basic behavioural model and approach proposed here. So far  most analyses are limited in their scope, but they allow for testing the impact of individual factors on the  adoption of ICT applications i n service provision without further extending  it to assess its outcomes and impact.   In our approach we thus propose to develop a behavioural and structural model to organise and  aggregate the different factors affecting the adoption and implementation of AI in public  administration , building on past research on ICT implementation at corporate and governmental levels and  on the impact assessment features of the perceived social value of ICT applications in public services model  originally proposed by Twizey imana and Andersson, (2019 ).   This new model is being applied and tested as a meta theory based on insights from literature. It is deemed  able to measure relationships between variables and correlates. Previous editions of the structural part of the  model have demonstrated that different drivers to adopt and implement new technologies can be grouped in  few categories, thus enabling the creation of composite indexes. For instance, data on adoption influencers can  be aggregated in institutional capacities, co ntextual factors, expected vs. measured (or perceived) outcomes,  and change pressures resulting from benchmarking/benchlearning activities.   In the following phase of the research we then aim to populate the model building on the information  generated by e mpirical analysis . The actual drivers and barriers to AI implementation via (and not  independently from) the public body’s or agency’s digital transformation can be derived from in -depth case  studies and additional ones can be collected via a questionnaire . A second set of variables consist s of  aggregations of outcomes, pressures and resources. Together, they can provide a means to measure the  propensity or willingness to adopt AI in the public sector, as well as the implementation and its outcomes.   An outline of the conceptual scheme that will be used to inform data gathering (through questionnaires and  interviews) and populate the model for its testing and validation is illustrated in Figure 18  below, outlining the  key forward and feedback loops of external and internal drivers and barriers to adopt and implement AI in the  delivery of public services and the renewal of policy making processes and procedures.     FIGURE 18 STRUCTURAL FACTORS A FFECTING ADOPTION OF  AI IN PUBLIC SE RVICES   Populating and validating the model will then involve the following steps:   1. Public sector representatives will be asked about their past and current experiences in adopting AI for service  provision better policy making, the underlying motivating factors, and the willingness to further implement  it in the future. This data gathering exercise will give an indication of the level of adoption and propensity  to adopt AI, thus linking propensity to adopt to actual implementation across a sample of relev ant cases.   2. As a separate, but not disjoint feedback, managers will be asked to narrow the focus on implementation, to  reconstruct the key internal and external drivers and barriers playing a role in public administration’s digital  transformation.   
  77   3. The interplay between AI adoption propensity and AI implementation will be used to assess impact s via the  configuration and testing of an outcome based structural model. This novel approach is intended to address  the limitations of currently used models tha t rely heavily on experts’ estimations on number of adoption  events or levels of investment by adoption units ( e.g. in the case of government agencies procuring AI  systems to support the delivery of public services).   Quantitative data will be collected th rough a questionnaire. This data gathering exercise is necessary to:    demonstrate and validate the structural model;    assess and rank the factors affecting the adoption of AI in public services for the cases analysed;    assess and rank the internal and extern al drivers and barriers to digital transformation;    generate indicators/parameters that can be used in scenario exercises (e.g. simulating the potential  socio -economic impact of the adoption of AI applications in the public sector).   4. To assess the process  and the statistical validity of the data gathering instrument before its use, a validation  exercise of at least 30 answered questionnaires will be carried out, in order to:    provide descriptive statistics of measured outcomes, factors influencing adoption,  drivers and  barriers to implementation in the cases analysed;    allow the testing of correlations between outcomes, other influencing factors, drivers and barriers,  propensity to adopt and ultimately implementation of AI in the public sectors.   5. The identi fication of a control panel of interviewees NOT involved in AI, but only in ICT implementation will  be also considered.   6. The contribution of an existing Input -Output ( I-O) model to the structural analysis, impact estimation and  simulation scenarios will be leverage d during the development of the  research , if deemed appropriate .  5.3.2  Developing scenarios of AI adoption and modelling potential impact   The decision to adopt a particular AI application in the public sector at the national and European levels is not   a linear process. The impact of technology in other sectors also affects the decision of individual organisation s  or policymakers to adopt or support the deployment of AI.   In this activity, scenarios of adoption based on the structural  model presented above will  be created .  It is worth noticing that traditionally impact assessments are undertaken to gauge if a given policy intervention  is likely to achieve the goals of a n intervention program ( ex-ante). Results of the ex -ante assessment  are used  to steer or redesign the intervention program scope and scale as well as its instruments and governance. Similar  efforts are conducted in ongoing or finished intervention programs to assess if their aims were achieved or the  scope and scale of th e effects. The most frequently used framework to organise the assessment is the well known intervention logic model (to achieve certain outcomes) or the so -called Theory of Change (inputs,  activities, outcomes). These basic frameworks despite their limitat ions have been widely used and came under  criticisms for their simplicity in the face of complex intervention programs where the counterfactual of effects  and the leverages to achieve desired outcomes are not trivial (Mayne, 2017; Moore & Evans, 2017) .  The shortcomings of the basic model of impact assessment has led to the development of a myriad of  complementary approaches (Branch et al., 2019) . In general, the approaches and mo dels for impact assessment  attempt to account for the paths between intervention and actual outcomes and effects in society in the face  of complexity of wicked problems. The challenge of assessing the effect of AI applications in the provision of  public se rvices resides on understanding the effects at the individual level (individuals, organisations) and to  scale them up to collective effects. Approaches like cost -benefit analysis, general equilibrium modelling, and  social return on investment present limit ations as they do not look into individual preconditions for preferences  and agency of actors, for example (Dhondt et al., 2016) . This  is in agreement with premises of recent research  into evaluation and impact assessment of ICT -enabled Social Innovation (Misuraca et al., 2018) . Some of the  most frequent approaches that have seen attempts to generate frameworks applicable to different areas of  policy analysis and impact assessment include also Diffusion analyses and Sy stem analysis approaches, such  as: Actor network theory; System dynamics and Agent based simulations and modelling. A review of the tenets  of these approaches to impact assessment can be followed in recent reports and literature on social impact  assessment  and evaluation (Misuraca et al., 2017) . However, these methodologies also present a number of  shortcomings that need to be considered and that we propose to overcome in our approach.   The modelling of technology diffusion is generally done based on data such as volume/value of sales,  volume/value/type of services provided, levels of investment for a specific technology in a given period of time  and geographic scope. When such data is av ailable, it is possible to estimate rates of diffusion and economic 
  78   effects (Rogers, 2010) . In this case, however, for the diffusion of AI in the provision of public services, we need  to esti mate the potential future effects of an emerging technology. Therefore, the likely effects on existing  processes and products are uncertain and must be estimated by the stated preferences of businesses and  citizens.   In general, system analysis approaches p ut emphasis on the need to look into the systemic character  of any realm of human activity . Here there is no consensus on the limits and boundary conditions of the  system. In general, the boundaries are set to a large extent ad-hoc. For example, public ser vice delivery involves  many agents but, in principle, they are divided in provider s (i.e. the government) and recipients of the service  (i.e. citizens and businesses). The stylised form and data availability of such models and tools have limited their  wide application in policy -making practice. While looking into the system as a whole, they normally build on  assumptions of experts concerning expected preferences, beliefs and values of the actors that they intend to  represent in the simulation exercises of b ehaviours and likely outcomes.   One of the major challenges in scenari o development is the reliability and validity of the parameters used  as initial conditions of the variables of interest . This is valid for systems dynamics (Forrester & Senge,  1980) , actor network, agent based modelling as well as in general equilibrium modelling for macro -economic  forecasts (Di Bartolomeo & Saltari, 2016) . When th ere are no data available (e.g.  time series data) to calibrate  the parameters of a model, generally the approach followed is to have a number of experts that agree on the  size and direction of the likely effects (i.e. achieving concurrent validation). An additional step to ensure the  reliability of the parameters to be used in the scenario modelling is to strive for structural validation. This means  that the relationship between variables is confirmed by means of statistical analysis indicating the strength  and direction of the relationship between the variables of interest. Often this step is not achieved.   One additional hurdle concerns the aggregation of disparate sources of influence on the variables of  interest  (drivers of adoption, adoption levels, social impact, employment and jobs) into a coherent set of  relations that can be reliably tested. In this area, most available theories for modelling does not fare well. For  this reason, we adopt here an intermediate  behavioural structural model  with a double purpose.   First, it enables to translate preferences, opinions expressed by experts, consumers and policymakers concerning  the likely effects of AI applications diffusion into numerical composites amenable to sta tistical testing.   Second, the intermediate structural model guides the structure of the further coupling to assess meso and  macro modell ing. In this regard, it is propose d as an initial attempt, to follow the approach developed recently  in the literature of innovation studies concerning the use of structural decision -making models related to  innovation activity (Montalvo, 2006; Wehn & Montalvo, 2018) .   As already mentioned above, the suggested bas ic behavioural model used has been already applied to the  testing of structure of adoption of ICTs in government in the provision of public services (Ozen et al., 2018;  Ozkan & Kanat, 20 11; Rana et al., 2013) . However, it will require validation of the scenarios proposed to optimise  the societal effects of AI adoption. To do this, (remote or face -to-face) workshops with experts and stakeholders’   representatives will be organised. The workshops will be based on a group model building dynamic  so to  contrast and discuss the strategy scenarios generated by the research team and to validate a final scenario  that optimises strategic levers and strategi c outcomes in terms of expected social and economic impact.   Finally, an estimation of the impact will be conducted based on the selected scenario that optimises  the target variables selected . This will facilitate the creation of a roadmap for further impl ementation of AI  in the public sector, for which a detailed approach and tools for implementation will be further refined in  collaboration with a group of experts and in consultation with representatives of Member States and relevant  stakeholders, as well as various services of the Commission and other international institutions as appropriate.   5.3.3  Methodology validation and stakeholders engagement   A crucial aspect to consider for developing a methodological approach that would combine scientific rigour with  practical application potential and policy relevance relies on the modalities of engagement with relevant  networks of experts and stakeholders, as well as on the access to strategic partners, including Member States  at both policy and technical level. For th is purpose, the research includes two levels of validation of the  methodology. First an extended pool of experts will be consulted including a dedicated group of external  expert assigned to accompany the methodology development; and other external experts.  In addition to this,  Member States representatives of the 'eGovernment Action Plan Steering Board'' and other stakeholders 
  79   FIGURE 19 FRAMEWORK FOR MEASU RING PUBLIC VALUE  representatives will be engaged in peer-learning workshops  organised alongside the research activities to  present, discuss and valid ate findings and validate methodological approaches and choices.61  Other opportunities to engage with experts and stakeholders, either during official or informal consultation  events, or online and in dedicated experts workshops, will be defined in details and in collaboration with DG  CONNECT and Member States. Cross -fertilisation with other Tasks of the AI Watch – and in particular the task  devoted to the Analysis of AI Strategies - will also be critical to develop a common approach and exchange  early resul ts, while strengthening the analysis and recommendations.   Finally, instrumental to the development of the proposed methodology as reservoir of data for the empirical  assessment of the model and to validate the scenarios and modelling assumptions, at least  10 in-depth  qualitative case studies will be conducted at country level , or with specific policy domain or administrative  level focus (e.g. city or regional level) or to address specific thematic areas (e.g. AI procurement) , so as to apply  the methodology  proposed to assess potential impacts and added value of the use of AI in public services.   As illustrated by the early findings of the landscaping analysis, the scope, goals and practices of public sector  use of AI is much diverse: relying on an automated  decision system to grant protection to asylum seekers is a  task with a different order of magnitude than increasing use of digital public services through predictive  analytics. Thus,  it is practical to gear the thinking towards high -potential impact appli cations that may have  consequences of particular relevance for the populations they target.   The case selection will be done in line with the public value approach proposed and will follow the model  developed by (Faulkner & Kaufman, 2018)  for assessing candidate cases and making the final selection. This  model is based on an extensive review of the literature on public value, from which the authors distilled four  components for meas uring public value, common to and applicable across different categories of organisation s,  public and private, acting separately or cooperating in joint initiatives. This would be particularly relevant to AI  application for the delivery of public services,  given that they are likely to be the product of collaborations  between different government agencies (e.g. in data sharing partnerships) as well as between public and private  actors (e.g. making use of shared cloud resources).   The four components of the model and their corresponding definitions are provided Figure 19:      The case study analysis and application of the approach to concrete experiences in Member States, will permit  thus to validate - and revise as it may be required - the proposed methodology,  while drawing up  recommendations on the way forward to roll out AI based systems and solutions in public services.                                                61 In this respect, the collaboration between JRC and DIGIT should be further exploited, considering the special role in co -leading two actions  of the ISA2 Programme (i.e. ELISE and IPS), so to build on synergies to coordinate activities and ensure complementarities.   Framework for measuring public value   1. Outcome achievement  = the extent to which a public body is improving publicly -valued outcomes across a wide variety of areas. e.g. human health,; access to knowledge, benefits to economic activity and employment, social capital  and cohesion, and environmental outcomes, improvements in social outcomes.   2. Trust and legitimacy  = the extent to which an organisation and its activities are trusted and pe rceived to be  legitimate by the public and by key stakeholders. This dimension includes the extent to which the public trust the  particular, trust the programs or services delivered by institution, and perceive an institution to be delivering services  transparently and fairly.   3. Service delivery quality  = the extent to which services are experienced as being delivered in high -quality manner  that is considerate of users’ needs. It is expected to be maximized when individuals who interact with the service ar e  satisfied, and when they perceive the services to be responsive to their needs, accessible, convenient, and incorporate  sufficient citizen engagement.   4. Efficiency  = the extent to which an organisation is achieving maximal benefits with minimal resource s. It is expected  to be high when the benefits provided by an organisation are perceived to outweigh the costs of that organisation, when  ‘unnecessary’ bureaucracy is avoided, and when an organisation is perceived to offer ‘value for money’.

  80   6 Conclusions   6.1 Coming back from a first venture into the unknown   The interest on the use of AI within European governments to support redesign ing internal  processes and policy -making mechanisms, as well as to improve public service delivery and  engagement with citizens is growing . This is demonstrated by the emerging body of literature and the  nascent applications in the public sector, a number of which have been included in our mapping  and analysis .   Governments across the EU Member and Associated States are exploring the potential of AI use to  help reorganise the internal management of public administration at all levels . Indeed, when used in  a responsible way , the combination of new, large data sources with advanced machine learning algorithms can  radically improve the operating methods of the public sector , thus paving the way to  pro-active public service  delivery models and relieving resource  constrained organisations from mundane and repetitive tasks.   However,  there seems to be an imbalance between the transformative potential and the effective  adoption and use of AI solutions in governmental organisations , and there is little evidence of th e  social and economic impacts achieved so far . For this purpose, d eparting from a review of existing  literature on public sector innovation and digital g overnment , followed by a landscaping exercise - which allowed  us to gather and map a first inventory of  230 AI use cases and do an analysis of existing national AI strategies  in all European countries  - this report  has the ambition to contribute to  unveiling the complexities, paradoxes  and pitfalls in  the implementation of this ‘new’ wave of technologies, for the improvement of policy design and  evaluation and of the delivery of public services to businesses and citizens .   Clearly, developing a baseline study for any topic is challenging to say the least, as you embark into  a journey in an unchartered territory . In the case of an emerging and ill -defined topic such as AI in the  public sector, the challenge is increased as you are boarding in a ‘venture into the unknown’ , with no established  parameters. This does not only means to devel op a measur ement  framework  for new phenomena  but also  defin e the emerging topic under investigation, which  takes on ma ny shapes and forms , in a bottom up fashion,  dictated more from the way it takes contingent characteristics  than the need to identify prec ise benchmarks  against which to be assessed.   Overall, from the landscaping exercise conducted it emerges that many European countries are  experimenting with a variety of AI technologies . The analysis of the initiatives included in our sample  shows the div ersity of AI typologies and purpose s, as well as the policy areas in which these are implemented,  providing a rich – though preliminary - overview of the use of AI in public services in the EU .   Although the data gathered  so far do not provide a full picture of the current landscape - as challenge s in data  collection and coverage remain - this inventory is encompassing enough to be regarded as a first and  unique reservoir  of knowledge , from which to extract indications, eme rging trends, and illustrative examples  of current AI usage, rather than a conclusive overview  of the state of the art. In fact, the analysis of findings  will also serve as a possible baseline for further analyses than those proposed in this  report , as it is becoming  clear that over the coming years, many more organisation s from the public sector will be willing and able to  use AI, by either developing their own solutions or sharing successful ones from other European administrations.   In this perspective, on the basis of the results of the mapping of cases, as well as the analysis of national AI  strategies focused on public sector, the proposals advanced in this study lay the methodologi cal  foundations of a framework for impact assessme nt that can support future road -mapping of AI in public  services throughout the EU.   But there is more. First , the longitudinal analysis of some case studies of AI -enabled government services and  policies from different countries of Europe has clearly demo nstrated how grounded the concerns are about an  (un)ethical use of AI  – as witnessed by most of the recent policy documents at national and supranational levels  – with respect to such issues as privacy and personal data protection, transparency, fairness i n operation, and  other constitutive elements of public action. There are high expectations from the use of AI in  government – but it is clear from our current exploration that positive impact is far from  straightforward and should not be taken for granted.    At the very bottom, it is of utmost importance not to overlook the ethical and sometimes, the political  risks associated with the new direction of change . A related implication affects the power relations  between the state and the  citizen s, which can be certainly improved by enabling the latter to criticise the  
  81   recommendations of the AI systems used for public services, although in some of the narratives provided, the  ruling of a Court or the raise of a negative opinion pushed by the media was needed to r ealise that, at the very  end, the real benefits of those innovations were not justifying the implementation costs, let alone the  reputational aspects.   A lesson learned is thus  to bear in mind that w hile small -scale pilot studies or experiments might be su ccessful   and the promises in case of broader adoption encouraging , setting aside dedicated resources and  providing  significant efforts to ensure larger scale usage of AI technologies inside the government machinery  may not be enough to accomplish the ultim ate goal of sustainable take -up. Where the term sustainable,  more than ever, does not only refer to monetary convenience, efficiency or even effectiveness of public action,  but points at the resulting (re)shaping of the government’s regulator and facilitat or role in our societies .  Undoubtedly this report fills in a gap in action oriented research into the development and  implementation of AI technologies in government and public service s, an area that  has not yet receiv ed  the same attention and funding as in the  case of private sector  and/or for business development . Truth to be  told, w ithout adoption and active implementation of AI, there will be  no positive impact from this technology .  However , and to a greater extent than the familiar e -Government and dig ital innovations, a comparable level  of attention must be devoted to the  ‘soft’ aspects of government transformation than the development and  take-up of AI systems and solutions.   6.2 Key findings from landscaping AI use in public services in the EU   The analysis of AI use cases in this report is based on a collection of 230 different AI initiatives  over across Europe (all the EU Member States , including UK that at the time of the data gathering i n 2019  was still part of the EU  as well as Norway  and Switzerland ). While all Member States appear herein, this is  clearly not a statistically significant overview as there has been no random selection and some countries are  more represented than others in terms of cases of AI use identified.  A majority of the AI use cases in the current  inventory in fact originate  from the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark and Estonia.   In addition, most of the evidence gathered is drawn from the national level of government , and most  cases named regional actually  originat e in fed eral countries. Only a quarter of the all initiatives collected take  place at the local level, which is likely not to be very representative of the real situation, as  local  authorities and especially cities are unanimously regarded as leading actors in exp erimenting with  AI technologies to cope with the various challenges materialising at urban and sub -regional levels .  While t wo working hypothes es have been formulated during the making of the mapping – one that there should  be an optimal size of population served by AI -enabled systems and the other that countries ranked  comparatively higher in Digital Government and Digital Economy index es would be overrepresented in the  inventory  – the truth is that at the moment it is too early to draw any conclusions.   As a matter of fact, t he public sector is multifaceted, composed of  many domains, institutions and units that  in  a relatively autonomous or independent way  design , adopt and apply technology solutions in general and AI based  specifically for a variety of different purposes. Depending on the domain, type of institution or  level of government there is first of all the need of better understanding whether an application  found in practice is in reality AI -based . In fact, i t remains challenging to define and op erationa lize what is  to be considered  AI and which technolog ies, application s, or algorithm s are to be include d, in particular when it  comes to public services and/or policies . In the inception of our empirical research , a broad definition of AI was  adopte d, so as  to allow the gathering of information on what the involved  public administration regard ed as AI.   While this approach lends to criticism in terms of structuring power of a reality that is stable enough to be  structured, for the reasons already exp ressed it seems well justified by the nature of the underlying  phenomenon – still fluctuating in terms of technological definition and evolution across time and space. In this  respect, our proposed taxonomy has  the advantage of focusing both on the typolog y of AI solutions  being used, but also the purpose for which they were deployed .   With all the above caveats , two are the typologies of AI which are most frequently appearing in  government: one related to Chatbots or Digital Assistants, and the other focus ed on providing some  sort of intelligent, data based predictions and simulation, through the recognition and visualisation  of patterns in (big) socioeconomic data . These two AI typologies are found in 51 and 36 of the gathered  cases  respectively . The other  two most frequent clusters, both holding 29 items, are  the use of Expert and Rule  Based systems, facilitating Algorithmic Decision Making  and of Computer vision in order to recognise persons,  objects or other  items in digital imagery.  
  82   Most of these AI sy stems , 87 out of 230, are used in the provision of general public services or in  communication and engagement activities . These occur in a large variety of typ ologies such as having  Chatbots to communicate with citizens, analysing data to make public servi ces more tailored  to beneficiaries   or public policy making more accessible through e.g.  automatic transcription of political hearings. Other evident   purposes of AI use are e.g. to assist in the enforcement of existing regulation, such as prioritizing targets likely  to break up  the law, or improving the internal management and maintenance of operations or even providing  insights for research and analysis of existing policy or to generated new policy, with the headcount being  respectively 47, 45 and 39 out of the 230 cases  in our mapping sample .   On the contrary, our research found the least represented AI applications in the granting of rights  and benefits , possibly since governments  are reluctant in delegating this authority to AI systems  in full, and  the generated controversies have in fact been part of the description of some longitudinal stories.    An important finding to underline is the fact that more than a half of the AI solut ions currently in use   (127 out of 230) seem to bring only incremental or technical changes to the government body or  agency adopting them . Among these, various Chatbots are included, which may well assist in the acquisition  of information by citizens, but frequently do not seem to change the nature of the public service delivery model  of the implementing organisation  – although some applications declare quite ambitious aims, such as  facilitating G2C transactions or becoming a one -stop-shop of government con tacts by connecting multiple  actors and information systems together. This is an encouraging trend, as disruptive and radical or  transformative changes induced by the adoption of AI are far less common based on our assessment.    In addition, it is worth str essing again that the disruptive innovations often come under scrutiny or  criticism, as citizens may not always appreciate the pro -active service delivery style of their  governments , for instance due to privacy or transparency concerns. A long term study, therefore, would be  required to document if some of the most disruptive trials have survived or suffered from later dismantling,  halted or reversed by new policies or regulations, leading to restrict the amount of transformative cases of AI  in government.   In this sense, it is also important to note that most of the current AI is being used to achieve performance  related goals , such as doing governmental tasks quicker,  faster, or more efficiently, with 68% (157 out of  230) of the  initiatives  having this ‘value driver ’ orientation. O nly 21% ( 49 out of 2 30) pursue instead inclusion  driven goals , e.g. to make public services more accessible to the citizens who have challenges in using the  traditional versions of the ir delivery models  or to those who do not feel  at ease with an all too large amount of  digital information to be consumed. Only in a mere 10% of the inventories AI initiatives ( 24 out of 2 30), the  goal of improving the openness of government actually comes to the forefront .   To complement the findings from the AI use cases, a survey was held among the European Member States in  order to gain unique insights with regard to their use of AI and their policy initiatives to facilitate or boost th at  usage. This survey was completed b y 18 countries, with answers often coordinated by a group of experts to  ensure valid responses. Following the results of the survey, 67% of the countries indicate to have set  aside some funding to stimulate development and adoption of AI in government , although the amount  of funding varies considerably.   On the other hand, more than half of the respondents  indicated that their government does not have  any specific training programme on AI available for civil servants . A good number of countries (13) did  instead establish departments, units or dedicated teams tasked with working  on or stimulating the uptake of AI  in the public sector, researching the effects of AI or preparing new AI -specific regulatio ns.   The findings further illustrate the high importance o f ethical and human -centric AI , while the need for a  dedicated AI law seems to be limited, as none of the governments have implemented such a law or shown  interest in doing it early. Instead, many countries aim to revise existing laws  if this is seen as ne cessary  to cope with the challenges AI brings with it.   A few Member States have illustrated their plans to  explore innovative public procurement to stimulate  the development and adoption of AI . These guidelines or principles are considered crucial for the  management of AI procurement projects, as they both equip civil servants with relevant expertise to tackle  common challenges in AI procurement such as ethical concerns, while at the same time allowing innovative  GovTech startups and SMEs to offer their inn ovative AI  solutions to government organis ations. It is therefore  well advised to continue exploring in the near future how existing procurement processes can or need be  adjusted to stimulate the use of emerging technologies, such as but not limited to AI,  in the public sector.  
  83   The survey results are globally confirmed by specific analyses conducted on the current data and AI governance  landscape, where we have found that many of the existing policy discourses aim to portray AI as an exception,  immune from existing governance frameworks and legislation. Instead, governments should see the  governance of AI as an extension of existing regulatory tools , such as for privacy and data protection,  competition law, consumer protection, ethical compliance etc.. These  guidelines are often adequate to limit the  unintended and unwanted consequences of AI deployment. However, challenges seems to remain in the speed  and capability to enforce - rather than on the intrinsic performance of - regulatory instruments coping with  the  major risks of AI.   In line with the overall scope of the AI Watch, this report has carried on a specific review of the AI national  strategies published by the Member States, to assess the focus of the documents on public sector . In this regard,  identi fying common policy themes and instruments , the review showed that most countries are taking  several actions to stimulate th e use of AI in their public sector . These include  actions to increase  the  uptake of AI in public administration  or aimed at improvin g the awareness and knowledge of the possibili ties  of AI in public services ; and initiatives to improve the quality, quantity and accessibility of data to enable the  development of AI. In addition, a variety of actions are planned  to enhance  the internal capacity of public  institutions to develop and deploy AI  nationwide .   However, as AI is still a new technology (or better said a combination of) and limited experience with it is shared,   not to mention reuse potential,  many strategies include  a requirement for experimental AI projects to  learn by doing and sharing experiences . Despite the potential of AI, there are in fact also concerns about  using AI in government. Therefore, actions taken by governments include the development of a legal fra mework  to assist civil servants in using AI in an ethical and human -centric way. Lastly, some strategies mention special  funding programmes to provide financial resources to start AI projects in government or to assist in using AI  start-ups de veloping  GovT ech solutions for the public sector .  Exactly to address the need of better understanding the positive and negative consequences of AI use  in public services , our research has reflected on the lack of evidence on impacts of AI in the public sector.  Despite the large amount of publications and policy discussions, most impact assessment studies conducted on  AI focus solely on technical assessment of those solutions, which takes place in optimal and controlled  environments. Assessing the impact of AI technologi es in a real -world setting, considering the challenges of  adoption and implementation of such innovations, and the need to ensure integration of these systems in the  existing dig ital infrastructures and organis ational processes, is likely to depict a very different picture.   Findings from some of the illustrative case studies described in this report already suggest that  there is a strong risk of civil servants not trusting the work of their AI ‘colleagues ’, meaning that  they double -check all the machine wo rk, possibly harming productivity rather than enhancing it. Other potential  paradoxes include enhanced detection of social problems because of AI, but then not having adequate resources  – or political approval - to act upon these problems, leading to wonde r what in the end the transformative  impact of the technology is about.   Taking into consideration the complexity of innovation adoption in the public sector, our research  proposes an original methodological framework  for impact assessment , building on pre vious work on   assessing the effects  of digital government transformation. In this approach, the contextual and individual  factors that are crucial for the impact assessment of AI applications  are defined , allowing for a comparison  between the ex-ante and t he ex-post policy situation resulting from the introduction of AI. Implementing this  approach takes particular care in analysing the organisational changes emerging  as a result of the adoption of  the AI system, as well as the broader social and economic im pact generated by the use of AI to improve  governance and public services delivery, according  to a public value perspective.   6.3 Policy i mplications and f uture research   This report provides a preliminary overview of the use of AI in public services in the EU . At the same time  it has outlined  a methodology proposal for assessing social and economic impacts of AI in this field. Its  ambitious goals and the achievements reported about place this endeavor within the evolving action research  stream on (digital) tec hnology for public policy, characterized by the increasing importance given to AI for the  public sector, and the recognition of the role of the government as a crucial player in the design of  the regulatory frameworks and tools for the governance ‘with and of’ AI.   The mapping exercise designed and conducted as a ‘baseline study ’ allowed us to develop  ad hoc typologies  and a framework of analysis, to better understand the public value generated by the use of AI in public services . 
  84   But clearly this is onl y the starting point of a learning journey, which requires an iterative approach,  involving relevant stakeholders and work with all Member States representatives , preferably at  different administrative levels. In particular, further ‘deep dives ’ at country  level through case studies and  thematic analyses are needed to test and validate the  assessment framework, while gathering insights and  recommendations for further extending it.   Only through such an iterative approach it will be possible to redefin e some  of the concepts and elements by  now considered as provisional and subject to change, as well as incorporate  them  into the proposed method for  modelling impact s. This will serve also to monitor and review the policy actions related to AI in the public sect or  that are outlined in the national strategies, complementing the research part of AI Watch dedicated to this  activity. As this report highlights, there are still various open issues in the field which limit our  understanding of the full potential of AI i n the public sector .   Our analysis also shows that the level of AI adoption and use across the European countries is  heterogeneous : both in terms of the number of use cases identified, and of the different technologies regarded  as AI and their purposes and functionalities. As illustrated by the early findings of the landscaping analysis, in  fact, the scope, goals and practices of pub lic sector use of AI is much diverse : just to make an example, an  automated decision system to grant protection to asylum seekers is a task of a far higher delicacy and   complexity  than increasing  the use of digital public services through predictive analyt ics. Thus it seems more   practical to gear future  thinking towards high -potential impact applications that may have consequences of  particular relevance for the populations they target.   Current ambitions with regards to AI are however plagued by various ch allenges in the adoption  and use of these technologies within the public sector . Whereas AI  development and adoption is a  cornerstone of the new Digital Strategy to shape the future of Europe, and it is regarded by EU Mem ber States  as a key technology for driving econo mic growth in the next decades, there are differences between the Member  States with regard to the wide range  of actions mentioned in the national documents , and the extent in which  they may develop specific ‘policy i nstruments ’.   In this rega rd, using the voca bulary of a classic categoris ation of different policy instruments (Bemelmans Videc et al., 1998)  distinguishing between ‘sticks ’ (i.e., regulatory instruments), ‘carrots ’ (i.e., economic and  financial instruments), and ‘sermons ’ (i.e., soft policy instruments, such as training and dissemination  programmes), we can o bserve that, for the time being, the emerging national strategies on AI in the public  sector in Europe seem to privilege a ‘sermon based approach ’. Soft policy instruments, such as campaigns  for awareness, encouragements to improve data quality , and traini ng, are in fact prevalent across  almost all countries . Regulation and financial resource allocation, such as project funding and procurement  process reviews, on the other hand, are instruments that are less uniformly distributed at this stage.   However, apa rt from further analysing the strategic actions undertaken by Member States to stimulate the  development and adoption of AI within their own administrations, there is also a need to take a closer look  at successful cases of AI implementation and learn from  their experiences . By researching on these  cases, best practices can be better understood and shared among the EU, which helps further scaling out of AI  solutions. Elaboration of what works and what does not work – using a comprehensive impact assessment  framework – is crucial to move the debate on AI forward on what AI is actually providing positive contributions  to public service  delivery and which may instead  be threat ening the quality of services.   This effort resonates well with the work being conduct ed by the High Level Expert Group on AI  (AI  HLEG )62, which developed as part of its mandate the Policy and investment recommendations for trustworthy  Artificial Intelligence . This document is the second deliverable of the AI HLEG and follows the publication of the  group's first deliverable, Ethics Guidelines for Trustworth y AI, published on 8 April 2019, and   The document  in fact  recognises the important role of Europe' s Public Sector to act as a catalyst of sustainable  growth and i nnovation , stating that ‘Europe has a strong public sector that can play a significant role when it  comes to the uptake and scaling of Trustworthy AI and establishing a Single Market for Trustworthy AI ’.  Moreover, it underlines that ‘Public services are critical to the relationship between the state and citizens, groups  and individuals  and that AI has the potential to play a significan t role in improving the quality and  efficiency of public services ’.                                              62.https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/high -level-expert -group -artificial -intelligence  
  85   This statement is further declined into a set of recommendations, which are structured around the following  four areas of intervention:   1) Provide human -centric AI -based services for individuals;   2) Approach the Government as a Platform, catalysing AI development in Europe;   3) Make strategic use of public procurement to fund innovation and ensure trustworthy AI; and   4) Safeguard fundamenta l rights in AI -based public services and protect societal infrastructures .   The evidence gathered in our research  at European and global level is perfectly in line  with these  recommendations . First and foremost, the human -centric aspect needs a twin declin ation – like two sides of  the same coin – both inside and outside the ‘black box ’ of the specific service being digitally transformed, thanks  to the contribution of the AI. This is directly related with the fourth recommendation  of the AI HLEG , however  to be interpreted more as a caveat against all -too-enthusiastic interpretations of preliminary AI trial results  than as a barrier to be raised against further innovation and experimentation in the domain at hand.   Approaching  the (EU and MS) government(s) as a  single platform has in our opinion the potential  of being the real game changer , also in comparison with United States and China. In fact, the signs are  relatively good of the intention to consider the AI policy strategy as a single EU -wide initiative, although  tempered by the usual differentiators at national level in the various EU  countries. The joint endorsement of  very important statements of principle, however, can only be considered as a first step in the direction of a  common approach to benefit and cost sharing across institutions and levels of government, grounded on a  reuse  logic and huge investments in capacity building of prospective inside users of these innovation.   In fact, the risk is pretty high that as partly happened in conventional e -Government until nowadays, the pace  of technological innovations with limited or n o outreach grows too fast compared with the rate of  transformation in existing service or policy practices, or creation of new services and policies, which is supposed  to be the ultimate goal of ICT s and now AI take -up in the public sector. If we add the c omplexity of designing,  testing and implementing AI successfully in real cases and the relative closeness of many initiatives in our  mapping , dictated by similar government needs and purposes despite their belonging to different public  administration conte xts, the importance of a coordinated a ction  to promote  AI innovation in Europe,  based on reuse, interoperability and sharing of implemented solutions , can only become more evident.   This leads us to the third recommendation, related to the use of innovative  public procurement  to  stimulate and speed up AI adoption , a specific activity that is likely to  further extend the appropriateness  and cost effectiveness  of AI take-up in government, meeting the expectations of increasingly proactive service  providers and  policy designers to the changing global  landscape , made more complicated by the Covid -19 crisis .   Future research activities should therefore go more in -depth to increase our understanding of the  conditions for these recommendations to be enforced and sup ported by coherent policy actions . This  will require  gaining  more information about the scope, depth, amount of resources and effects of such actions.  For example, while many strategies highlight the need to enhance the AI skills within the public sector, it would  be useful to compare how many trainings are given, to whom, how many are attending and whether after the  training, uptake and use of AI in the public sector has increased.   This should include the developmen t of a dynamic database, based on a modular approach to data  collection , including not only the Member States’ strategies that will be published in the coming months, but  also a broader spectrum of policy documents relevant to AI in the public sector, that  are not necessarily part of  the official AI Strategies o r can even constitute best practice examples from other non -EU context s to take  proper inspiration from.   While our  first Survey Questionnaire has been designed to further complement the exploratory analysis and the  inventory of the situation in each EU Member State, additional modules should be developed to gather data  through surveys, focus groups and other statistical techniques, so as to have a more in depth mapping of AI  use in public service, an d identify trends, gaps, and different scenarios in service provision as well  as in governance of AI , at both national and sub -national level, including through linking with the AI4CITIES63  and the ‘Living -in-EU’64 initiative s coordinated by DG  CONNECT, and the future Smart Cities and Communities  initiatives that may be funded under the forthcoming Digital Europe Programme .                                              63 https://ai4cities.eu   64 https://www.living -in.eu 
  86   Finally, this activity should also  consider alternative policy scenarios , including the absence of specific l egal  and regulatory instruments , leaving ‘ethical principles ’ and ‘responsible practices ’ as merely voluntary; a  moderate legal framework, encouraging or requiring technical adjustments that do not conflict significantly  with profits; or a restrictive regulatory systems, curb ing or banning deployment of the technology .65  In support  of such analys es of contextual conditions  and to better assess the current use  level of AI in policy   processes and public service delivery, a set of highly impactful cases involving the use of AI sho uld be  conducted at EU and global level . This work w ould thoroughly analyse AI implications from different angles  (e.g. technical, semantic, organis ational, legal, and economic ) and policy perspectives. These analyses are to be  conducted with a twofold obj ective: on the one side, to further expand the knowledge base for the mapping;  and on the other side, to define drivers and barriers to implementation, thus contribut ing to  develop the impact  assessment framework and the roadmap with recommendations and guidelines on use of AI in public services.   In this regard, interoperability issues and the role of location information and data intelligence in the  roll-out of AI in public  administration should also be considered , in order to provide recommendations  for action research and draw p ossible implications for policy, with specific regard to the assessment of broader  innovative public services. In parallel to this, and f ollowing t he presentation of the initial methodology proposal  to assess potential impacts and added value of the use of AI in public services at the 1st Peer Learning Workshop  with Member  States on 11 -12 February 2020, in-depth qualitative case st udies should  be con ducted to test  and further refine the proposed approach. This will include collecting data according to specific indicators,  making sure that the socio -economic context is appropriately taken into account.   The case study analysis and application of the ap proach to concrete experiences in Member States, will permit  to validate - and revise as it may be required - the proposed methodology, while drawing up recommendations  on the way forward to roll out  AI based systems and solutions in public services. For t his purpose, the outline  of the propos al for developing a methodological approach for assessing the use and impact of AI  in public services in the EU will be further advance and reviewed with stakeholders through ad-hoc  consultation activities and peer -learning workshops with experts and Member States  representatives .   In the same vein, b ased on the results of the analysis conducted to landscape the use of AI in public services  across the EU Member and Associated States, and the application of the proposed methodological approach to  the case studies, the research will further analyse strengths and weaknesses in  addressing questions of AI  governance in different contexts, and draw recommendations  on how to best coordinate the efforts  of policy -makers and regu lators within the data/algorithm sphere . To this end, the findings  will provide   directions  on concrete actions  for further development of AI based systems and solutions in government .  The insights gained from the review of cases will be then further elaborated in order to design a proposal of  framework for the use of AI in public services, defining guidelines and a generic implementation  roadmap , based on best practices and the results of the analysis of the re -use potential of AI  based systems  and solutions, identifying also opportunities for collaboration among relevant stakeholders from various sectors.                                                    65 Ochigame, R., The Invention of  ‘Ethical AI ’ - https://theintercept.com/2019/12/20/mit -ethical -ai-artificial -intelligence
