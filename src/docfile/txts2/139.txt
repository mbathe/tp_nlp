  4     Executive Summary   This report is an attempt to comprehensively examine information disorder and its related  challenges, such as filter bubbles and echo chambers. While the historical impact of rumours  and fabricated content have been well documented, we argue that contempor ary social  technology means that we are witnessing something new: information pollution at a global  scale; a complex web of motivations for creating, disseminating and consuming these  ‘polluted’ messages; a myriad of content types and techniques for amplif ying content;  innumerable platforms hosting and reproducing this content; and breakneck speeds of  communication between trusted peers.     The direct and indirect impacts of i nformation pollut ion are difficult to quantify. We’re only at  the earliest of stages  of understanding their implications. Since the results of the ‘Brexit’ vote  in the UK, Donald Trump’s victory in the US and Kenya’s recent decision to nullify its national  election result, there has been much discussion of how information disorder is infl uencing  democracies. More concerning, however, are the long -term  implications of dis-information   campaigns designed specifically to sow mistrust and confusion and to sharpen existing socio cultural divisions using nationalistic, ethnic, racial and religiou s tensions.     So, how do we begin to address information pollution? To effectively  tackle the problems of  mis-, dis- and mal - information, we need to work together on the following fronts:   1. Definitions.  Think more critically about the language we use so we can effectively  capture the complexity of the phenomenon;   2. Implications for democracy.  Properly investigate the implications for democracy when  false or misleading information circulates online;   3. Role of television.  Illuminate the power of the mainstream me dia, and in particular  television, in the dissemination and amplification of poor -quality information that  originates online;   4. Implications of weakened local media.  Understand how the collapse of local   journalism has enabled mis -and dis -information to take hold, and find ways to support  local journalism;   5. Micro -targeting.  Discern the scale and impact of campaigns that use demographic  profiles and online behavior to micro -target fake or misleading informa tion1;   6. Computational amplification.  Investigate the extent to which influence is bought  through digital ‘astroturfing’ —the use of bots and cyborgs to manipulate the outcome  of online petitions, change search engine results and boost certain messages on so cial  media;                                                     1 Hendrix, J. and Carroll, D.

  5     7. Filter bubbles and echo chambers.  Consider the implications of the filter bubbles and  echo chambers that have emerged because of media fragmentation, both offline  (mediated via partisan talk radio and cable news) and online (mediated via hyper partisan websites, algorithmically derived feeds on social networks and radical  communities on WhatsApp, Reddit and 4chan.)2  8. Declining trust in evidence.  Understand the implications of different communities  failing to share a sense of reality based on fac ts and expertise.     In this report, we refrain from using the term ‘fake news’, for two reasons. First, it is woefully  inadequate to describe the complex phenomena of information pollution. The term has also  begun to be appropriated by politicians around the world to describe news organisations  whose coverage they find disagreeable. In this way, it’s becoming a me chanism by which the  powerful can  clamp down upon, restrict, undermine and circumvent the free press.      We therefore introduce a new conceptual f ramework for examining information disorder,  identifying the three different types: mis -, dis- and mal -information. Using the dimensions of  harm and falseness, we describe the differences between these three types of information:   ▪ Mis-information is when fa lse information is shared, but no harm is meant.   ▪ Dis-information is when false information is knowingly shared to cause harm.   ▪ Mal-information is when genuine information is shared to cause harm, often by  moving information designed to stay private into th e public sphere.         We also argue that we need to separately examine the ‘ elements ’ (the agent, messages and  interpreters) of information disorder. In this matrix we pose questions that need to be asked  of each element.                                                     2 Beran, Dale. “4chan: The Skeleton Key to the Rise of Trump.” Medium.com , February 14, 2017.  https://medium.com/@DaleBeran/4chan -the-skeleton -key-to-the-rise-of-trump -624e7cb798cb   
  6         We also emphasise the need to consider the three different ‘ phases ’ (creation, production,  distribution) of information disorder.   As we explain, the ‘agent’ who creates a fabricated message might be different to the agent  who produces that message —who might also be different from the ‘agent’ who distributes  the message. Similarly, we need a thorough understanding of who these agents are and what  motivates them.     We must also understand the different types of messages being distributed by agents, so that  we can start estimating the sca le of each and addressing them. (The debate to date has been  
  7     overwhelmingly focused on fabricated text news sites, when visual content is just as  widespread and much harder to identify and debunk.)     Finally, we need to examine how mis -, dis- and mal -inform ation are bein g consumed,  interpreted and acted upon.  Are they being re -shared as the original agent intended? Or are  they being re -shared with an oppositional message attached? Are these rumours continuing  to travel online, or do they move offline into pe rsonal conversations, which are difficult to  capture?     A key argument within this report, which draws from the work of the scholar James Carey, is  that we need to understand the ritualistic function of communication. Rather than simply  thinking about commu nication as the transmission of information from one person to  another, we must recognize that communication plays a fundamental role in representing  shared beliefs. It is not just information, but drama  — “a portrayal of the contending forces in  the world .”3     The most ‘successful’ of problematic content is that which plays on people’s emotions,  encouraging feelings of superiority, anger or fear. That’s because these factors drive re sharing among people who want to connect with their online communities an d ‘tribes’.   When most social platforms are engineered for people to publicly ‘perform’ through likes,  comments or shares, it’s easy to understand why emotional content travels so quickly and  widely, even as we see an explosion in fact -checking and debunki ng organizations.     In addition to our conceptual framework, we provide a round -up of related research, reports  and practical initiatives connected to the topic of information disorder, as well as filter  bubbles and echo chambers. We examine solutions that have been rolled out by the social  networks and consider ideas for strengthening existing media, news literacy projects and  regulation. We also introduce some key future trends, particularly in terms of the rise of  closed messaging apps and the implication s of artificial intelligence technology for  manufacturing as well as detecting dis-information .    The report ends with an explanation of thirty -four  recommendations, targeted at technology  companies, national governments, media organisations, civil society, education ministries and  funding bodies.  They are explained in detail after the report ’s conclusions.     What could technology companies  do?  1.

  10     Introduction   Rumours, conspiracy theories and fabricated information are far from new.4 Politicians have  forever made unrealistic promises during election campaigns. Corporations have always  nudged people away from thinking about issues in partic ular ways. And the media has long  disseminated misleading stories for their shock value. However, the complexity and scale of  information pollution in our digitally -connected world presents an unprecedented challenge.   While it is easy to dismiss the sudden  focus on this issue because of  the long and varied  history of mis - and dis -information5, we argue that there is an immediate need to seek  workable solutions for the polluted information streams that are now characteristic of our  modern, networked and incr easingly polarised world.   It is also important to underline from the outset that, while much of the contemporary furor  about mis-information  has focused on its political varieties, ‘information pollution’6  contaminates public discourse on a range of issue s. For example, medical mis-information  has  always posed a worldwide threat to health, and research has demonstrated how incorrect  treatment advice is perpetuated through spoken rumours7, tweets8, Google results9 and  Pinterest boards10. Furthermore, in the realm of climate change, a recent study examined the  impact of exposure to climate -related conspiracy theories. It found that exposure to such  theories created a sense of powerlessness, resulting in disengagement from politics and a  reduced likelihood of p eople to make small changes that would reduce their carbon  footprint.11    In this report, we hope to provide a framework for policy -makers, legislators, researchers,  technologists and practitioners working on challenges related to mis -, dis- and malinformation —which together we call information disorder.                                                     4 Sunstein, Cass R., and Adrian Vermeule. “Conspiracy Theories: Causes and Cures”.

  11     But first, how did we get to this point? Certainly, the 2016 US Presidential election led to an  immediate search for answers from those who had not considered the possibility of a Trump  victory —namely the major news outlets, pundits and pollsters.  And while the US election  result was caused by an incredibly complex set of factors – socio -economic, cultural, political  and technological – there was a desire for simple explanations, and the idea tha t fabricated  news sites could provide those explanations drove a frenzied period of reporting, conferences  and workshops.12    Reporting by Buzzfeed News’ Craig Silverman provided an empirical framework for these  discussions, offering evidence that the most p opular of these fabricated stories were share d  more widely than the most popular stories from the mainstream media: “In the final three  months of the US presidential campaign, 20 top -performing false election stories from hoax  sites and hyper -partisan blog s generated 8,711,000 shares, reactions, and comments on   Facebook. Within the same time period, the 20 best -performing election stories from 19  major news websites generated a total of 7,367,000 shares, reactions, and comments on  Facebook.”13   In addition, research on referral data shows that “fake news” stories relied heavily on social  media for traffic during the election14. Only 10.1% of traffic to the top news sites came from  social media, compared with 41.8% for ‘fake news sites’. (Other traffic referral  types were  direct browsing, other links and search engines.)     While we know that mis-information  is not new, the emergence of the internet and social  technology have brought about fundamental changes to the way information is produced,  communicated and d istributed. Other characteristics of the modern information environment  include:   a) Widely accessible, cheap and sophisticated editing and publishing technology has  made it easier than ever for anyone to create and distribute content;                                                     12 See write -ups of some of t he most important events here: Shorenstein Center’s ‘Fake News Agenda for  Research and Action: ( https://shorensteincenter.org/combating -fake-news -agenda -for-research/ ); and Yale  University’s Information Society Project’s Fighting Fake News Workshop  https://law.yale.edu/system/files/area/center/isp/documents/fighting_fake_news_ -_workshop_report.pdf  and the  Westminster Media Forum Keynote Seminar: Fake news - scope, public trust and options for policy,  http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2017/08/ 10/the -evolving -conversation -around -fake-news -and-potential solutions/   13 Silverman, C.

  12     b) Information consumption,  which was once private, has become public because of  social media;   c) The speed at which information is disseminated has been supercharged by an  accelerated news cycle and mobile handsets;   d) Information is passed in real -time between trusted peers, and any pi ece of  information is far less likely to be challenged.   As Frederic Filloux explained: “What we see unfolding right before our eyes is nothing less  than Moore’s Law applied to the distribution of mis-information : an exponential growth of  available technolo gy coupled with a rapid collapse of costs.”15    A study conducted in eighteen  countries by the BBC World Service in September 2017 found  that 79% of respondents said they worried about what was fake and what was real on the  internet.16 Brazilians  were most troubled , with 92% of respondents from that country  expressing some concern  about the issue . The least concerned were Germans, where 51% of  respondents indicated that they were worried . Unfortunately, we don’ t have similar data  from  previous years to under stand whether concern has increased in light of recent  discussions about the phenomenon. But one thing to bear in mind  is that when the purpose  of Russian dis-information  campaigns is to sow mistrust and confusion about what sources of  information are auth entic , it is important that we continue to track attitudes about  the  information people source from the internet.     Another critical point is that popular social networks make it difficult for people to judge the  credibility of any message, because posts f rom publications as unlike as the New York Times   and a conspiracy site look nearly identical. This means that people are increasingly reliant on  friends and family members to guide them through the information ecosystem. As Messing  and Westwood have argued , “social media has had two effects: by collating stories from  multiple sources, the focus is on the story, and not on the source; secondly, endorsements  and social recommendations guide readership”17 rather than traditional gatekeepers or  ingrained reading  habits.                                                     15 Filloux, F.

  13     Daily , we spend twice as much time online compared with 2008. During that protracted  amount time, we consume incredible amounts of information18 and inevitably make mistakes.  Recent research by Filippo Menczer and colleagues shows we are so utterly inundated that  we share untruths. Parsing information and judging the credibility of sources on Facebook or  other social platforms will require our bra ins to adapt with new cognitive strategies for  processing information. But Facebook is only 13 years old.19   Social networks are driven by the sharing of emotional content. The architecture of these  sites is designed such that every time a user posts conten t—and it is liked, commented upon  or shared further — their brain releases a tiny hit of dopamine. As social beings, we intuit the  types of posts that will conform best to the prevailing attitudes of our social circle.20 And so,  on this issue of information disorder, this performative aspect of how people use social  networks is critical to understanding how mis - and dis -information spreads.     However, we must also recognize the role of television in spreading dis-information .21 While  much has been written about  the growing influence of Sputnik and Russia Today22, as well as  its new youth channel, In the Now,  the unintentional amplification of dis-information  by the  mainstream media across the world needs to be acknowledged. From the New York Times’  inaccurate rep orting on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, to  the wall -to-wall coverage of   Hillary Clinton’s leaked emails (now known to be carried out by Russian hackers), or the  almost daily amplification of Trump’s tweets (some including information from conspiracy  sites23), getting the mainstream media to amplify rumour and dis-information  is the ultimate  goal  of those who seek to manipulate. Without amplification, dis-information  goes nowhere.     It is within this context that we have to study information disorder. Th ese technology  platforms are not neutral communication pipelines. They cannot be, as they are inherently  social, driven by billions of humans sharing words, images, videos and memes that affirm their  positions in their own real -life social networks.                                                       18 Meeker, M (2017) Internet Trends, 2017.

  14     Curre ntly, Western democracies are worried about how, in a diverse global media system,  potential rivals like ISIS and Russia can use dis-information  to further expand their reach into  legislative and executive branches of power. The shock of the Brexit referen dum, the US  election, Le Pen reaching the run -off vote in the French election and the overturning of the  Kenyan election have been used as examples of the potential power of systematic disinformation  campaigns. However, empirical data about the exact infl uence of such campaigns  does not exist.     As danah boyd argues about recent responses to fears about mis - and dis -information, “It’s  part of a long and complicated history, and it sheds light on a variety of social, economic,  cultural, technological, and po litical dynamics that will not be addressed through simplistic  solutions.”24 Certainly, we have to look for explanations for how societies, particularly in the  West, have become so segregated in terms of terms of age, race, religion,  class and politics.25    Recognizing the impact of factors such as the collapse of the welfare state, the failure of  democratic institutions to provide public services, climate change and miscalculated foreign  interventions are required. We cannot see the phenomenon of mis - and di s-information in  isolation, but must consider its impact amid the new -media ecosystem. This ecosystem is  dominated by increasingly partisan radio, television and social media; exaggerated emotional  articulations of the world; quick delivery via algorithmic ally derived feeds on smartphones  and audiences that skim headlines to cope with the floods of information before them.   Making sense of mis -, dis- and mal -information as a type of information disorder, and learning  how it works, is a necessity for open dem ocracies. Likewise, neglecting to understand the  structural reasons for its effectiveness is a grave mistake.     Communication as Ritual     One of the most important communication theorists, James Carey, compared two ways of  viewing communication - transmission and ritual - in his book Communication as Culture:  Essays on Media and Society .26  Carey wrote, “The transmission view of communication is the commonest in our culture — perhaps in all industrial cultures… It is defined by terms such as ‘imparting,’ ‘sending,’  ‘transmitting,’ or ‘giving information to others.’”27 The ‘ritual view of communication’, by                                                    24 boyd, d.

  15     contrast, is not about “the act of impart ing information but the representation of shared  beliefs.”     Under a transmission view of communication, one sees the newspaper as an instrument for  disseminating knowledge. Questions arise as to its effects on audiences —as enlightening or  obscuring reality , as changing or hardening attitudes or as breeding credibility or doubt.  However, a ritual view of communication does not consider the act of reading a newspaper to  be driven by the need for new information. Rather, it likens it to attending a church serv ice.  It’s a performance in which nothing is learned, but a particular view of the world is portrayed  and confirmed. In this way, news reading and writing is a ritualistic and dramatic act.28  In this report, we pay close attention to social and psychological  theories that help to make  sense of why certain types of dis-information  are widely consumed and shared. Considering  information consumption and dissemination from merely the transmission view is unhelpful  as we try and understand information disorder.   Four Key Points     The term  ‘fake news’  and the need for definitional rigo ur  Before we continue , a note on terminology.  One d epressing aspect of the past few months  is  that, while it has resulted in an astonishing number of reports, books, conferences and  events, it has produced little other than funding opportunities for research and the  development of tools. One key reason for this stagnation, we argue, is an absen ce of  definitional rigour, which has resulted in a failure to recognize the diversity of mis - and dis information, whether of form, motivation or dissemination.     As researchers like Claire Wardle29, Ethan Zuckerman30, danah boyd31 and Caroline Jack32 and  journ alists like the Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan33 have argued, the term ‘fake news’ is  woefully inadequate to describe the complex phenomena of mis - and dis -information. As  Zuckerman states, “It’s a vague and ambiguous term that spans everything from fa lse balance  (actual news that doesn’t deserve our attention), propaganda (weaponized speech designed                                                    28 Carey (1989),  pp.20 -21  29 Wardle, C.

  16     to support one party over another) and  disinformatzya  (information designed to sow doubt  and increase mistrust in institutions).”34    A study by Tandoc  et al ., published in August 2017 , examined 34 academ ic articles that used  the term ‘fake news’  between 2003 and 2017.35  The authors noted that the term has been  used to describe a number of different phenomena over the past 15 years: news satire, news  parody, f abrication, manipulation, advertising and propaganda. Indeed, this term has a long  history, long predating President Trump’s recent obsession with the phrase.     The term “fake news” has also begun to be appropriated by politicians around the world to  descri be news organisations whose coverage they find disagreeable. In this way, it’s becoming  a mechanism by which the powerful can clamp down upon, restrict, undermine and  circumvent the free press. It’s also worth noting that the term and its visual derivative s (e.g.,  the red ‘FAKE’ stamp) have been even more widely appropriated by websites, organisations  and political figures identified as untrustworthy by fact -checkers to undermine opposing  reporting and news organizations.36 We therefore do not use the term i n this report and  argue that the term should not be used to describe this phenomenon.     Many have offered new definitional frameworks in attempts to better reflect the complexities  of mis - and dis -information.  Facebook defined a few helpful terms in their paper on  information operations:   1. Information (or Influence) Operations.  Actions taken by governments or organized  non-state actors to distort domestic or foreign political sentiment, most frequently to  achieve a strategic and/or geopolitical outcome. These  operations can use a  combination of methods, such as false news, dis-information  or networks of fake  accounts aimed at manipulating public opinion (false amplifiers).   2. False News.  News articles that purport to be factual, but contain intentional  misstateme nts of fact to arouse passions, attract viewership or deceive.   3. False Amplifiers.  Coordinated activity by inauthentic accounts that has the intent of  manipulating political discussion (e.g., by discouraging specific parties from  participating in discussion or amplifying sensationalistic voices over others).     In ‘Fake News. It’s Complicated’, Wardle outlines seven types of mis - and dis -information,  revealing the wide spectrum of problematic content online, from satire and parody (which,                                                    34 Zuckerman, (2017).   35 Tandoc, Jr., E.

  17     while a form of art, c an become mis-information  when audiences misinterpret the message)  to full -blown fabricated content.     Figure 1: 7 Types of Mis - and Dis -information (Credit: Claire Wardle, First Draft)     While these seven classifications are helpful in encouraging people to see beyond the  infamous ‘ Pope endorses Trump’ -type news sites that received so much attention after the  US election, the phenomenon requires an even more nuanced conceptual framework — particularly one that highlights the impact of visuals in perpetuating  dis-information . We have  therefore created such a framework, and we will use as the organizing structure for the  report.   While we work through terms and descriptions, it’s important that we recognise the  importance of shared definitions. As Caroline Jack  argued in the introduction to her recent  report, Lexicon of Lies , for Data & Society:     “Journalists, commentators, policymakers, and scholars have a variety of words at  their disposal — propaganda, dis-information , mis-information , and so on — to  describe  the accuracy and relevance of media content. These terms can carry a lot of  baggage. They have each accrued different cultural associations and historical  meanings, and they can take on different shades of meaning in different contexts.  These differences may seem small, but they matter. The words we choose to describe  media manipulation can lead to assumptions about how information spreads, who  
  18     spreads it, and who receives it. These assumptions can shape what kinds of  interventions or solutions seem desira ble, appropriate, or even possible.”37    Visuals, Visuals, Visuals   As well as the other problematic aspects of the popular term ‘fake news’ outlined above, it  has also allowed the debate to be framed as a textual problem. The focus on fabricated news  ‘sites’ means the implications of misleading, manipulated or fabricated visual content,  whether that’s an image, a visualization, a graphic, or a video  are rarely considered . The  solutions by the technology companies have been aimed squarely at articles, and while  admittedly that is because natural language processing is more advanced, and therefore text  is easier to analyse computationally, the framing of the debate as ‘fake news’, has not helped.   As we describe in this report,  visuals  can be far more persuasive than other forms of  communication38, which can mak e them much more powerful vehicles for mis - and dis information. In addition, o ver the past couple of months,  we’ve been confronted with the  technologi cal implications whe reby relatively limited audio or video clips of someone can act  as very powerful ‘training data’ allowing for the creation of completely fabricated audio or  video files , making it appear that someone has said something that they have not. 39  Source -Checking  vs Fact -Checking   There is much discussion of fact -checking in this report. There has been an explosion of  projects and initiatives around the world, and this emphasis on providing additional context  to public statements is a very positive development. Many of these organisations are focused  on authenticating  official sources: politicians , reports by think tanks  or news reports  (a list of  European fact -checking organiz ation are listed in Appendix A), bu t in this age of disinformation  where we are increasingly seeing information created by unofficial sources (from  social media accounts we don’t know, or websites which have only recently appeared) , we  argue that we need to be do ing source -checking as well as fact -checking.   Increasingly , when assessing  the credibility of a piece of information , the source who  originally created the content or first shared  it, can provide the strongest evidence about  whether something is accurate. Newsrooms, and people relying on social media for  information, need to be investigating  the source, almost before they look at the content itself.  For example, routinely people should be r esearching the date and location embedded in                                                    37 Jack, C.

Similarly,  people should be instinctively  checking whether a  particular twee ted message has appeared elsewhere, as it could be that the same message  was tweeted out by  ten different accounts at exactly the same time, and six  of them we re  located in other countries. Newsrooms in particular need  more powerful tools to be able to  visually map online networks and connections to understand how dis-information  is being  created, spread and amplified.   Strategic Silence   Newsrooms also need more powerful tools to help them understand how dis-information  is  moving across communities. In election monitoring projects First Draft has been involved with  in France, the UK and Germany, Newswhip (a platform which helps new srooms discover  content before it goes viral) was used as a way of monitoring whether a piece of misleading,  manipulated or fabricated content was predicted to be shared widely. Newswhip has a  prediction algorithm which allows the user to see how many soci al interactions a piece of  content has received at any given moment and to offer a prediction about how many  interactions it would have twenty -four hours later. First Draft used this technology to inform  decisions about what stories to debunk and which one s to ignore. If certain stories, rumours  or visual content, however problematic, were not gaining traction, a decision was made not  to provide additional oxygen to that information. The media needs to consider  that publishing  debunks can cause more harm th an good, especially as agents behind dis-information   campaigns see media amplification as a key technique for success. Debunks themselves can  be considered a form of engagement. The news industry needs to come together to think  about the implications of th is type of reporting and the philosophical and practical aspects of  incorporating these ideas related to strategic silence.   The Report     The report starts with a new conceptual framework for talking about information disorder ,  including three types, three p hases and three elements. We then consider the specific  challenges of filter bubbles and echo chambers, before moving on to examine the solutions  that have been put it place to date  (including those by the technology companies, education  initiatives, the m edia and regulatory bodies ). We end the report with a look at future trends,  before wrapping up with some conclusions, and additional  details about the thirty -four   recommendations we are proposing.    
  20     Part 1: Conceptual Framework   Our conceptual framework has  three components, each of which is also broken down into  three parts:   1) The Three Types of Information Disorder: Dis -information, Mis -information and  Mal-information   2) The Three Phases of Information Disorder: Creation, Production and Distribution   3) Th e Three Elements of Information Disorder: Agent, Message and Interpreter   The Three Types of Information Disorder   Much of the discourse on ‘fake news’ conflates three notions: mis -information, dis information and mal -information. But it’s important to distinguish messages that are true  from those that are false, and messages that are created, produced or distributed by “agents”  who intend to do harm from those that are not:   ● Dis-information.  Information that is false and deliberately created to harm a pe rson,  social group, organization or country.   ● Mis-information.  Information that is false, but not created with the intention of  causing harm.   ● Mal-information.  Information  that is based on reality, used to inflict harm on a  person, organization or country.     Figure 2: Examining how mis -, dis- and mal -information intersect around the concepts of  falseness and harm. We include some types of hate speech and harassment under the ma linformation category, as people are often targeted because of their personal hist ory or  
  21     affiliations. While the information can sometimes be based on reality (for example targeting  someone based on  their religion)  the information  is being used strategically to cause harm.     The 2017 French Presidential election40 provides examples that i llustrate all three types of  information disorder.   1)     Examples of dis -information:   One of the most high profile hoaxes of the campaign, was the  creation of a sophisticated  duplicate version of the Belgian newspaper Le Soir , with a false article claiming that Macron  was being funded by Saudi Arabia.41 Another example was the circulation of documents  online  claiming falsely  that Macron had opened an offshore bank account in the Bahamas.42  And finally, dis-information  circulated via ‘Twitter raids’ in which loosely connected networks  of individuals  simultane ously took to Twitter  with identical hashtags and messages to spread  rumours about Macron (e.g., that he was in a relationship with his step -daughter).   2) Examples of mis-information:   The attack on the Champs Elysees on 20 April 2017 inspired a great deal of mis-information43,  as is the case in almost all breaking news situations. Individuals on social media  unwittingly  published a number of rumours , for example the news that a second policeman had been  killed. The people sharing this type of content are rarely doing so to cause h arm. Rather, they  are caught up in the moment, trying to be helpful, and fail to adequately inspect the  information they are sharing.   3) Examples of mal-information :  One striking example of mal-information  occurred when Emmanuel Macron’s emails were  leaked  the Friday before the run -off vote on 7 May. The information contained in the emails  was real, although Macron’s campaign allegedly included false information to diminish the  impact of any potential leak.44 However, by releasing private information into th e public                                                    40 For an in depth analysis of Dis -information and the French President Election see also: Bakamo (2017a) The  Role and Impact of Non -Traditional Publishers in the 2017 French Presidential Ele ction.

  22     sphere minutes before the media blackout in France, the leak was designed to cause  maximum harm to the Macron campaign.     In this report, our primary focus is mis - and dis -information, as we are most concerned about  false information and content s preading. However, we believe it’s important to consider this  third type of information disorder and think about how it relates to the other two categories.  However, hate speech, harassment and leaks raise a significant number of distinct issues, and  there  is not space in this report to consider those as well. The research institu te Data &  Society is  doing particularly good work on mal-information  and we would recommend reading  their report Media Manipulation and Disinformation Online .45  The Phases  and Elements  of Information Disorder   In trying to understand any example of information disorder, it is useful to consider it in three  elements:     1) Agent. Who were the ‘agents’ that created, produced and distributed the example,  and what was their motivation?   2) Message. What type of message was it? What format did it take? What were the  characteristics?   3) Interpreter. When the message was received by someone, how did they interpret the  message? What action, if any, did they take?     Figure 3: The Three Elements of Information Disorder     We argue that it is also productive to consider the life of an example of information disorder  as having three phases:   1. Creation. The message is created.   2. Production. The message is turned into a media product.   3. Distribution. The message  is distributed or made public.                                                     45 Marwick, A and R. Lewis (May 2017) Media Manipulation and Dis -information Online, Data & Society ,  https://datasociety.net/output/media -manipulation -and-disinfo -online/ ,  
  23       Figure 4: The Three Phases of Information Disorder     In particular, it’s important to consider the different phases of an instance of information  disorder alongside its elements, because the agent that creates the content i s often  fundamentally different from the agent who produces it. For example, the motivations of the  mastermind who ‘creates’ a state -sponsored dis-information  campaign are very different  from those of the low -paid ‘trolls’ tasked with turning the campaign’ s themes into specific  posts. And once a message has been distributed, it can be reproduced and redistributed  endlessly, by many different agents, all with different motivations. For example, a social  media post can be distributed by several communities, l eading its message to be picked up  and reproduced by the mainstream media and further distributed to still other communities.  Only by dissecting information disorder in this manner can we begin to understand these  nuances.   In the next two sections, we will  examine these elements and phases of information disorder  in more detail.   The Three Phases of Information Disorder   To examine how the phases of creation, production and distribution help us understand  information disorder , let’s use the example of the ar ticle ‘Pope Francis Shocks World,  Endorses Donald Trump for President, Releases Statement’ published on the self -proclaimed  fantasy news site WTOE 5 in July 2016. For an in -depth analysis of this article and the network  of sites connected to it, we would r ecommend reading ‘The True Story Behind The Biggest  Fake News Hit Of The Election’ from Buzzfeed.46                                                    46 Craig Silverman (Dec 2016) The True Story Behind The Biggest Fake News Hit Of The Election,  Buzzfeed ,  https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/the -strangest -fake-newsempire?utm_term=.yrzPyEpLXq#.nqXD9N7opO   
  24           Figure 5: Screenshot of the fabricated news article published in July 2016 on WTOE5News.com  (The site no longer exists) .    If we think about the three phases in this example, we can see how different agents were  involved in creating the impact of this content.   
  25       Figure 6: Using the example of the ‘Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for  President, Releases Statem ent’ fabricated news articles to test the Three Phases of  Information Disorder     The role of the mainstream media as agents in amplifying (intentionally or not) fabricated or  misleading content is crucial to understanding information disorder. Fact -checking  has always  been fundamental to quality journalism, but the techniques used by hoaxers and those  attempting to disseminate dis-information  have never been this sophisticated. With  newsrooms increasingly relying on the social web for story ideas and content , forensic  verification skills and the ability to identify networks of fabricated news websites and bots is  more important than ever before.    The Three Elements of Information Disorder   The Agent   Agents are involved in all three phases of the information chain – creation, production and  distribution – and have various motivations. Importantly, the characteristics of agents can  vary from phase to phase.   We suggest seven questions to ask about an agent:   1) What type of actor are they?   Agents can be official, li ke intelligence services, political parties, news organizations.  They can also be unofficial, like groups of citizens that have become evangelized about  
  26     an issue.     2) How organized are they?   Agents can work individually, in longstanding, tightly -organized org anizations (e.g., PR  firms or lobbying groups) or in impromptu groups organized around common  interests.     3) What are their motivations?   There are four potential motivating factors: Financial:  Profiting from information  disorder through advertising; Political:  Discrediting a political candidate in an election  and other attempts to influence public opinion; Social:  Connecting with a certain  group online or off; and Psychological : Seeking prestige or reinforcement.     4) Which audiences to they intend to rea ch?  Different agents might have different audiences in mind. These audiences can vary  from an organization’s internal mailing lists or consumers, to social groups based on  socioeconomic characteristics, to an entire society.     5)  Is the agent using automat ed technology?   The ability to automate the creation and dissemination of messages online has  become much easier and, crucially, cheaper. There is much discussion about how to  define a bot. One popular definition from the Oxford Internet Institute is an acc ount  that posts more than 50 times a day, on average. Such accounts are often automated,  but could conceivably be operated by people. Other accounts, known as cyborgs, are  operated jointly by software and people.     6) Do they intend to mislead?    The agent m ay or may not intend to deliberately mislead the target audience.   7) Do they intend to harm?   The agent may or may not intend deliberately to cause harm     The Message   Messages can be communicated by agents in person (via gossip, speeches, etc.), in text  (newspaper articles or pamphlets) or in audio/visual material (images, videos, motion graphics, edited audio -clip, memes, etc.). While much of the current discussion about ‘fake  news’ has focused on fabricated text articles, mis - and dis -information often appears in visual  formats. This is important, as technologies for automatically analysing text are significantly  different from those for analysing still and moving imagery.   We offer five questions to ask about a message:    
  27     1. How durable is the message?   Some messages are designed to stay relevant and impactful for the long term  (throughout an entire war or in perpetuity). Others are designed for the short term  (during an election) or just one moment, as in the case of an individual message during  a breaking ne ws event.   2. How accurate is the message?   The accuracy of a message is also important to examine. As discussed earlier, mal information is truthful information used to harm (either by moving private information  into the public arena or using people’s affiliat ions, like their religion, against them).  For inaccurate information, there is a scale of accuracy from false connection (a  clickbait headline that is mismatched with its article’s content) to 100% fabricated  information.   3. Is the message legal?   The message might be illegal, as in the cases of recognised hate speech, intellectual  property violations, privacy infringements or harassment. Of course, what messages  are legal differs by jurisdiction.   4. Is the message ‘imposter content’, i.e. posing as an official source?   The message may use official branding (e.g., logos) unofficially, or it may steal the  name or image of an individual (e.g., a well -known journalist) in order to appear  credible .  5. What is the message’s intended target?   The agent has an intended audie nce in mind (the audience they want to influence) but  this is different to the target of the message (those who are being discredited). The  target can be an individual (a candidate or a political or business leader), an  organisation (a private firm or a go vernment agency), a social group (a race, ethnicity,  the elite, etc.) or an entire society.     The Interpreter   Audiences are very rarely passive recipients of information. An ‘audience’ is made up of many  individuals, each of which interprets information acc ording to his or her own socio -cultural  status, political positions and personal experiences.     As outlined earlier, understanding the ritualistic aspect of communication is critical for  understanding how and why individuals react to messages in different ways. The types of  information we consume, and the ways in which we make sense of them, are significantly  impacted by our self -identi ty and the ‘tribes’ we associate with. And, in a world where what  we like, comment on and share is visible to our friends, family and colleagues, these 'social'  and performative forces are more powerful than ever.     
  28     Having to accept information that challenges our sense of self can be jarring. Irrespective of  how persuasive a message may appear to a neutral observer, it is ea sier to ignore or resist  information that opposes our own worldview. Certainly, evidence suggests that fact -checks  do tend to nudge individuals’ knowledge in the direction of the correct information, but it  certainly doesn’t replace the mis - or dis -informa tion entirely.     This reality complicates our search for solutions to information disorder. If we accept that  human brains do not always work rationally, simply disseminating more quality information is  not the answer. Solutions must grapple with the social  and performance characteristics that  have helped make certain fabricated content so popular on Facebook. How, for example, can  we make sharing false information publicly shameful and embarrassing? What can we learn  from the theories of performativity, par ticularly in performance and identity management in  an online setting that could help us experiment with some potential solutions?     What the ‘interpreter’ can do with a message highlights how the three elements of  information disorder should be considered  parts of a potential never -ending cycle. In an era  of social media, where everyone is a potential publisher, the interpreter can become the next  ‘agent,’ deciding how to share and frame the message for their own networks. Will they show  support for the me ssage by liking or commenting on it, or will they decide to share the  message? If they do share the message, have they done so with the same intent as the  original agent, or will they share it to, for example, show their disagreement?         Figure 7: Questions to ask about each element of an example of information disorder   
  29       Figure 8: Using the ‘Three Elements of Information Disorder’ to examine the ‘Pope Endorses  Trump’ article     In the next section, we will review literature that helps provide a deep er historical and  theoretical understanding of the three elements of information disorder.   1) The Agents: Who are they and what motivates them?     In this section, we explore the role of agents, or those who create, produce and distribute  messages. Again, t he motivations of the person who creates and posts a meme on an invite only chat group on Discord could be different from the person who sees the meme on their  Facebook feed and shares it with a WhatsApp group.     Official v s Unofficial Actors?     When officia l actors are involved, the sophistication, funding and potential impact of a  message or campaign of systematic messages is far greater. Much has been written about the  impact of Russian propaganda on information ecosystems in Europe and further afield. One  of  the most notable is the Rand Corporation’s report from July 2016, entitled “The Russian  ‘Firehose of Falsehood’ Propaganda Model,”47 which identified four characteristics of modern  Russian propaganda:     1. Voluminous and multi -channeled                                                     47 Paul, Christopher and Miriam Matthews, (June 20, 2016) The Russian “Firehose of Falsehood” Propaganda  Model: Why It Might Work and Options to Counter It, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation,  https://www.rand.o rg/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html   
  30     2. Rapid, continuous an d repetitive   3. Noncommittal to objective reality   4. Inconsistent in its messaging     The EU Stratcomm Taskforce provides regular analysis of Russian propaganda messaging  across the European Union.48. Likewise, their research shows that a key strategy of Russia is   to spread as many conflicting messages as possible, in order to persuade audiences that there  are too  many versions of events to find the truth . As they explai n, “Not only (are) big media  outlets like Russia Today or Sputnik … deployed, but also seemingly marginal sources, like  fringe websites, blog sites and Facebook pages. Trolls are deployed not only to amplify disinformation  messages but to bully those... brave enough to oppose them . And the network  goes wider: NGOs and “GONGOs” (government organised NGOs); Russian government  representatives ; and other pro -Kremlin mouthpieces in Europe, often on the far -right and far left. In all, literally thousands of channels are used to spread p ro-Kremlin dis-information , all  creating an impression of seemingly independent sources confirming each oth er’s  message .”49    In April 2017, Facebook published a paper by three members of its Security team, entitled  “Information Operations an d Facebook,” that outlines the use of the platform by state actors.  They define information operations as “actions taken by organized actors (governments or  non-state actors) to distort domestic or foreign political sentiment, most frequently to  achieve a strategic and/or geopolitical outcome. These operations can use a combination of  methods, such as false news, dis-information  or networks of fake accounts aimed at  manipulating public opinion (we refer to these as ‘false amplifiers’).”50     While Russian propaganda techniques are the current focus of much concern, digital  astroturfing campaigns – that is, campaigns that use troll factories, click farms and automated  social media accounts – have been used by other state actors for years. A recent report by the  Computational Propaganda Research Project tracked this activity across twenty -eight  countries, showing the scale of these operations.51    Perhaps the most notable of these state actors is China, which has paid people to post  millions of fabricated social  media posts per year, as part of an effort to “regularly distract the                                                    48 European Union’s East StratCom Task Force,  https://euvsdisinfo.eu/   49 EU East StratCom Task Force, (Jan 19, 2017), Means, goals and consequences of the pro -Kremlin dis information campaign, ISPI http://www.ispionline.it/it /pubblicazione/means -goals -and-consequences -prokremlin -dis-information -campaign -16216   50 Jen Weedon, William Nuland and Alex Stamos (April 27, 2017) Information Operations and Facebook, p. 4  https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/facebook -and-information -operations -v1.pdf   51 Bradshaw, S. and P.

  31     public and change the subject” from any policy -related issues that threaten to incite  protests.52 In countries like Bahrain and Azerbaijan, there is evidence of PR firms creating fake  accounts on social media to influence public opinion.53 Duterte’s government has used  sophisticated ‘astroturfing’ techniques to target individual journalists and news  organizations.54     Additionally, in South Africa, an email leak in May exposed large -scale dis-information  efforts  by the powerful Gupta family to distract attention from its business dealings with the  government. These efforts included paying Twitter users to abuse journalists and spread disinformation  and the use of bots to amplify fabricated  stories.55  In contrast to official actors, unofficial actors are those who work alone or with loose  networks of citizens, and create false content to harm, make money, or entertain other like minded people.     Following the outcry about the role of fabricate d websites in the 2016 US election, journalists  tracked down some of these ‘unofficial’ agents. One was Jestin Coler, who, in an interview  with NPR, admitted that his “whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of  infiltrate the echo cha mbers of the alt -right, publish blatantly [false] or fictional stories and  then… publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction.” As NPR  explains, “[Coler] was amazed at how quickly fake news could spread and how easily peopl e  believe[d] it.”56    How organised are the agents?     Trolls have existed since the internet was invented.57 Definitions vary, but one aspect is key:  trolls provoke emotions by publicly offending their targets. Trolls are humans who post  behind a username or h andle. Yet, similar to bots, they can amplify dis-information  in  coordinated ways to evoke conformity among others. What they do better than bots is target                                                    52 King, G, J. Pan & M.

  32     those who question the veracity of a piece of information. Trolls work efficiently to silence  naysay ers in the early stages of dis-information  distribution by posting personal attacks to  undermine that person’s position on the board. And we know that some governments  organize agents to pursue specific messaging goals on social media, whether through bots ,  cyborgs or ‘troll factories.’58    In the report entitled ‘Media Manipulation and Disinformation  Online’ from Data & Society,  Alice Marwick and Rebecca Lewis analyzed ‘Gamergate’, an online campaign of bullying and  harassment that took place in late 2014. T hey identified organized brigades, networked and  agile groups, men’s rights activists and conspiracy theorists as exploiting “young men’s  rebellion and dislike of ‘political correctness’ to spread white supremacist thought,  Islamophobia, and misogyny throu gh irony and knowledge of internet culture”.59   Buzzfeed’s Ryan Broderick examined similar, loosely -affiliated groups of Trump supporters in  the US who were active during the French election.60 Using technologies like Discord (a set of  invite -only chat rooms ), Google documents, Google forms and Dropmark (a file -sharing site  like Dropbox), they organized ‘Twitter raids’ where they would simultaneously bombard  Twitter accounts they hoped to influence with messages using the same hashtags.     Analysis of mis-infor mation  during the French election by Storyful and the Atlantic Council  showed that such loose, online networks of actors push messages across different platforms.  Anyone wishing to understand their influence needs to monitor several closed and open  platfor ms. For example, in the context of the US election, Trump supporters produced and  “audience -tested many anti -Clinton memes in 4Chan and fed the ones with the best  responses into the Reddit forum  ‘The_Donald.’ The Trump campaign also monitored the  forum for material to circulate in more mainstream social media channels.”61     Finally, it’s worth mentioning ‘fake tanks’, or partisan bodies disguised as think tanks. As  Transparify, the group that prov ides global ratings on the financial transparency of think  tanks, has explained, “[T]hese [fake tanks] range from essentially fictitious entities  purposefully set up to promote the very narrow agenda and vested interests of (typically one  single) hidden fu nder at one extreme, to more established organisations that work on  multiple policy issues but (occasionally or routinely) compromise their intellectual                                                    58 Benedictus, L., “Invasion of the troll armies: from Russian Trump supporters to Turkish state stooges,”,  Guardian https://www.theguard ian.com/media/2016/nov/06/troll -armies -social -media -trump -russian   59 Marwick, A and R.

Looking into what motivates agents not only provides a deeper understanding of how dis - or  mal-information campaigns work, it also points to possible ways to resist them.   It is a mistake to talk generally about agents’  motivations, since they vary in each phase. It is  quite likely that publishers (e.g., an editor of a cable news show) or distributors (e.g.,  a user  on a social network) of a message may not even be fully aware of the real purpose behind a  piece of dis-information .    As we illustrate above, if a message is partly or entirely false, but no harm is intended by its  producer, it doesn’t fall under the definition of dis-information . For this reason, it’s important  to differentiate between mis-information  (false,  but not intended to harm) and malinformation  (true, but intended to harm).     i) Political   Producers of dis-information  campaigns, from Russia and elsewhere, sometimes have political  motivations. A great deal has been written about Russian dis-information  activity in Europe,  but it’s worth quoting at length from a statement given by Constanze Stelzenmüller to the US  Senate Committee on Intelligence, in June 2017, on the subject of potential interference by  Russia in the German Federal elections:      “Three things are new about Russian interference today. Firstly, it appears to be  directed not just at Europe’s periphery, or at specific European nations like Germany,  but at destabilizing the European project from the inside out: dismantling decades of  progress  toward building a democratic Europe that is whole, free, and at peace.  Secondly, its covert and overt “active measures” are much more diverse, larger -scale,  and more technologically sophisticated; they continually adapt and morph in  accordance with changi ng technology and circumstances. Thirdly, by striking at Europe  and the United States at the same time, the interference appears to be geared  towards undermining the effectiveness and cohesion of the Western alliance as  such —and at the legitimacy of the We st as a normative force upholding a global order                                                    62 Written evidence provided to the UK Parliamentary Inquiry on Fake News by Transparify  http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/culture -media -and-sport committee/fake -news/written/47967.html  
  34     based on universal rules rather than might alone. That said, Russia’s active measures  are presumably directed at a domestic audience as much as towards the West: They  are designed to show that Europe and the  U.S. are no alternative to Putin’s Russia. Life  under Putin, the message runs, may be less than perfect; but at least it is stable.”63    In terms of Russian dis-information , one of the best sources of information is the EU East  StratCom Task Force,64 which h as a site called ‘euvsdisinfo.eu’ that provides regular updates  about Russian dis-information  campaigns across Europe. As they explain, “the dis-information   campaign is a non -military measure for achieving political goals. Russian authorities are  explicit about this, for example through the infamous Gerasimov doctrine and through  statements by top Russian generals that the use of ‘false data’ and ‘destabilising propaganda’  are legitimate tools in their tool kit.” Elsewhere, the Task Force wrote, “The Russia n Minister  of Defence describes information as ‘another type of armed forces.’”65    One critical aspect to understanding Russian dis-information , as noted by information warfare  expert Molly McKew, is that “information operations aim to mobilize actions and behavioral  change. It isn't just information.”66 As the recent revelations about Russian operatives  purchasing dark ads on Facebook67 and organizing protests via Facebook’s Events feature68  show, the aim of these acts is to create division along socio -cultural lines.     ii) Financial   Some of those who produce or distribute dis-information  may do so merely for financial gain,  as in the case of PR firms and fabricated news outlets. Indeed, entir e businesses might be  based on dis-information  campaigns.69                                                      63 Stelzenmüller, C.

  35     Fabricated ‘news’ websites created solely for profit have existed for years. Craig Silverman  documented some of the most prolific in the US in his 2015 report70 for the Tow Center for  Digital Journ alism. However,  the US election shone a light on how many of these sites are  located overseas, but aimed at US audiences. Buzzfeed  was one of the first news  organisations to detail the phenomenon of English -language websites created by  Macedonians to capi talise on US readers’ enthusiasm for sensationalist stories.71 The small  city of Veles in Macedonia produced “an enterprise of cool, pure amorality, free not only of  ideology but of any concern or feeling about the substance of the election. These  Macedonia ns on Facebook didn’t care if Trump won or lost the White House. They only  wanted pocket money to pay for things.”72  This example from Veles also underscores the difficulty of assessing the true motivation of  any particular agent. The dominant narrative has  been that these young people were  motivated by the financial benefits. We can assume this is true, as they undoubtedly made  money, but we will unlikely ever know whether there was any coordinated attempt to  encourage these teenagers to start this type of work in the first place.     ‘Fake news’ websites make money through advertising.  While Google and Facebook have  taken steps to prevent these sites from getting money through their ad networks, there are  still many other networks through which site owners ca n make money.     French startup Storyzy alerts brands when they appear on dubious websites. In a August 2017  write -up of their work, Frederic Filloux explains that over 600 brands had advertisements on  questionable sites. When they were approached for commen t, Filloux concluded that few  cared, as long as their “overall return on investment was fine.”  They certainly did not seem to  consider the ethical implications of helping to fuel a ‘vast network of mis-information .’73    iii) Social and Psychological   While m uch of the debate around dis-information  has focused on political and financial  motivations, we argue that understanding the potential social and psychological motivations  for creating dis-information  is also worth exploring.                                                       70 Silverman, C.

  36     For example, consider the  motivation to simply cau se trouble or entertain . There have always  been small numbers of people trying to ‘hoax’ the news media —from Tommaso Debenedetti,  who frequently uses fake Twitter accounts to announce the death of high profile people,74 to  the person be hind the ‘Marie Christmas’ account, who fooled CNN into thinking he or she was  a witness to the San Bernardino shooting.75     Some share mis-information  as a joke, only to find that people take it seriously. Most  recently, during Hurricane Harvey, Jason Michael McCann tweeted the old, already -debunked  image from Hurricane Sandy of a shark swimming in a flood highway. When Craig Silverman  reached out to hi m for comment, he explained, “Of course I knew it was fake, it was part of  the reason I shared the bloomin' thing... What I had expected was to tweet that and have my  1,300 followers in Scotland to laugh at it.”     On more serious matters, the previously -men tioned research by Marwick and Lewis76 takes a  deep dive into alt -right communities and discusses the importance of considering their shared  identity in understanding their actions online.     Examining the audiences of hyper -partisans sites, such as Occupy Democrats  in the US and  The Canary  in the UK, we can also see the influence of political tribalism and identity. These  types of sites do not peddle 100% fabricated content, but they are very successful in using  emotive (and some would argue misleading) hea dlines, images and captions – which are often  all of an article that’s read on platforms like Facebook  – to get their audiences to share their  messages.     In August 2017, Silverman and his colleagues at Buzzfeed published the most comprehensive  study to d ate of the growing universe of US -focused, hyper -partisan websites and Facebook  pages. They revealed that, in 2016 alone, at least 187 new websites launched, and that the  candidacy and election of Donald Trump “unleashed a golden age of aggressive, divisiv e  political content that reaches a massive amount of people on Facebook.”77                                                         74 Kington, T.

  37     Is the agent using automation?   Currently, machines are poor at creating dis-information , but they can efficiently publish and  distribute it. Recent research by Shao and colleague s concluded that “[a]ccounts that actively  spread mis-information  are significantly more likely to be bots.” They also found that bots are  “particularly active in the early spreading phases of viral claims, and tend to target influential  users.”78    Bots can  manipulate majority -oriented platform algorithms to gain vast visibility and can  create conformity among human agents who would then further distribute their messages.79  Many bots are designed to amplify the reach of dis-information80 and exploit the  vulnerabilities that stem from our cognitive and social biases. They also create the illusion  that several individuals have independently come to endorse the same piece of information .81   As a recent report on computational amplification by  Gu et al . concluded: “A properly  designed propaganda campaign is designed to have the appearance of peer pressure —bots  pretending to be humans, guru accounts that have acquired a positive reputation in social  media circles —these can make a propaganda camp aign -planted story appear to be more  popular than it actually is.”82 Despite the platforms’ public commitment to stifle automated  accounts, bots continue to amplify certain messages, hashtags or accounts, creating the  appearance of certain perspectives bein g popular and, by implication, true.83    A recent report by NATO StratCom entitled ‘Robotrolling’ found that two in three Twitter  accounts posting in Russian about the NATO presence in the Baltics and Poland were bots.  They also found the density of bots is 2 to 3 times greater among Russian -tweeting accounts  than in English -tweeting accounts. The authors conclude that foreign -language sources on  social networks are policed and moderated much less effectively than English -language  sources.84                                                      78 Shao, C., G.L.

  38     It also seems pos sible that there may be a black market for social bots. Ferrara found that  many bots who supported Trump in the 2016 election also engaged with the #MacronLeaks  trend, but made few posts in -between.85    Important research has been done on bots recently, particularly in terms of thinking about  their definition, scale and influence. The most comprehensive body of research has been  carried out by the Oxford Internet Institute’s Computational Propaganda Research Project.86  They define high -frequency accounts a s those that tweet more than 50 times per day on  average. While often these accounts are bots, we also need to realise there are some humans  who tweet that frequently. There are also cyborg accounts87, which are jointly operated by  people and software. As N ic Dias argues, looking at an account’s posting frequency can be  more useful than a fixation on whether an account is fake or not.88     There are certainly highly partisan individuals whose accounts could be mistaken for bots. A  Politico article in August 20 17 described how tens of thousands of tweets per day continue to  emanate from a very human, grassroots organisation. Using Group Direct Messages on  Twitter, they organize people into “invite -only rooms with names like ‘Patriots United’ and  ‘Trump Train. Ma ny rooms have accompanying hashtags to track members’ tweets as they  propagate, and each can accommodate as many as 50 people.”89    Returning to our discussion around agents’ motivations, these examples show the power of  social and psychological motivations for creating and disseminating mis - and dis -information.   Being a part of the tribe is a powerful, motivating force.    2) The Messages: What format do they take?   In the previous section we examined the different characteristics of the ‘agents’ those who  are involved in creating, producing or disseminating information disorder. We now turn our  attention to the messages themselves.     There are four characteristics that make a message more appealing and thus more likely to be  consumed, processed and shared wi dely:     1) It provokes an emotional response.                                                     85 Ferrara, E. et al. (2016)   86 Woolley, S & P. Howard, (2017)   87 Chu, Z., S. Gianvecchio, H. Wang, S. Jajodia, (Nov/Dec 2012) Detecting Automation of Twit ter Accounts: Are  You a Human, Bot, or Cyborg?

  39     2) It has a powerful visual component.   3) It has a strong narrative.   4) It is repeated.     Those who create information campaigns, true or false, understand the power of this  formula. Identifying these characteristics helps us to recognize dis-information  campaigns  which are more likely to be successful, and to inform our attempts to counter dis-information   (see more in Part Three).     Verbal, text or audio?   While much of the conversation about mis - and dis -information has focused on the role of the  internet in propagating messages, we must not forget that information travels by word of  mouth.  The  offline and online worlds are not separate, although the challenges researchers  face in effectively studying the effects of different forms of communication simultaneously  means it’s easier to think about these elements separately.     The ‘fake news’ conve rsation has also focussed on text -based, fabricated news websites. As  Nausicaa Renner argues, “the fake news conversation has taken place in the realm of words,  but that’s missing a big part of the story. Much of the content that circulates on Facebook are   images, often memes. They’re not attached to an article, and there’s often no way to trace  their source. And while Facebook’s algorithm is notoriously elusive, it seems to favor images  and video over text. As such, images have the potential to reach more readers than articles —  whether fake, real, non -partisan or hyper -partisan.”90  Certainly, in the election -based projects First Draft led in France and the U.K., visuals were  overwhelmingly the most shared and the most difficult to debunk of misleading conte nt. In  both cases, while there were almost no examples of fabricated news sites as we saw in the US  context, there were large numbers of highly shareable images, infographics and memes (i.e.,  compelling images with large block text layered over top.)91                                                      90 Renner, N.

  40       Figure 9: An example of a ‘meme’ shared widely during the UK election     As scholarship of visuals92 has shown, the way we understand imagery is fundamentally  different to how we understand text.93 Our brains process images at an incredible speed  when compared with text.94 As a result, our critical reasoning skills are less likely to engage  with what we’re seeing.     Technology that could identify manipulated or fabricated images lags behind technology for  parsing and analysing text. While Google’s Reverse Image Se arch engine (see also TinEye and  Yandex) is a good starting point for identifying when images have circulated before, we still  don’t have publicly available reverse -video search engines or OCR (Optical Character  Recognition) tools capable of reading the te xt on memes in a timely manner. We need more  sophisticated, widely accessible tools to help identify problematic visual content.   Over the next few years, we will certainly see the development of artificial intelligence  technologies to create as well as ide ntify dis-information . (Simply understood, artificial  intelligence is the ability of computers to undertake tasks that we previously needed human  brains to work, like speech recognition or visual identification.) It is critical that the engineers  who devel op the new products, tools and platforms have been provided ethical training on  the unintended consequences of the algorithms they write.      Upon whom are the messages focused?                                                     92 Sontag S. (1977) On Photography, New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux.   93Postman, N. (1985). Amusing ourselves to death: Public discourse in the age of television. New York: Viking.   94 A team of neuroscientists from MIT has found that the human brain can process entire images that the eye sees  for as little as 13 milliseconds. See: Potter, M. C. (2014).

  41       While agents have particular audiences in mind when they create dis-information , the  targeted subject of the message will be different. Dis-information  often deliberately highlights  differences and divisions, whether they be between supporters of different political parties,  nationalities, races, ethnicities, religious  groups, socio -economic classes or castes. As  Greenhill argues, these types of messages enable discriminatory and inflammatory ideas to  enter public discourse and to be treated as fact. Once embedded, such ideas can in turn be  used to create scapegoats, no rmalize prejudices, harden us -versus -them mentalities and, in  extreme cases, even catalyze and justify violence.95     Most discussion around dis-information  in the US and European contexts has focused on  political messages, which, while worrying from a democratic perspective, tend not to incite  violence. However, in other parts of the world, dis-information  directed toward people due to  their religious, ethni c or racial identities has led to violence. As Samantha Stanley explained,  “perhaps the most obvious example of how mis-information  can lead to violent offline action  is the two -day riots in Myanmar’s second largest city, Mandalay, in July 2014. Following an  unsubstantiated  rumor posted on Facebook that a Muslim tea shop owner raped a Buddhist  employee, a mob of almost 500 people wreaked havoc on the city and incite d lingering fear  amongst its Muslim citizens . Two people were killed during the riot, one Buddhist and one  Muslim.”96  3) Interpreters: How do th ey make sense of the messages?   As Stuart Hall explained in his seminal work on reception theory97, messages are encoded by  the producer, but then decoded by individual audience members in one of three ways:     1. Hegemonic.  Accepting the message as it was encod ed.  2. Negotiated.  Accepting aspects of the message, but not all of it.   3. Oppositional . Declining the way the message was encoded.     In this section, we outline the work of key cultural and social theorists who have attempted to  explain how audiences make sense of messages.     George Lakoff sees rationality and emotions as being tied together to the extent that, as  human beings, we cannot think without emotions. The emotions in our brains are structured                                                    95 Greenhill, K. M. (forthcoming).

  42     around certain metaphors, narratives and frames. They help us make sense of things, and,  without them, we would become disoriented. We would not know what or how to think.     Lakoff distinguishes two different kinds of reason: ‘False reason’ and ‘real reason.’98 False  reason, he says, ‘sees reason as fully conscious, as  literal, disembodied, yet somehow fitting  the world directly, and working not via frame -based, metaphorical, narrative and emotional  logic, but via the logic of logicians alone.’ Real reason, alternatively, is an unconscious thought  that ‘arises from embo died metaphors.’99 He argues that false reason does not work in  contemporary politics, as we’ve become increasingly emotional about our political affiliations.     Understanding how our brains make sense of language is also relevant here. Every word is  neurall y connected to a particular frame, which is in turn linked together with other frames in  a moral system. These ‘moral systems’ are subconscious, automatic and acquired through  repetition. As the language of conservative morality , for example,  is repeated, frames and in  turn the conservative system of thought are activated and strengthened unconsciously and  automatically. Thus, conservative media and Republican messaging work unconsciously to  activate and reinforce the conservative moral system , making it harder for fact -checks to  penetrate.100    Considering Trump’s success, D’Ancona recently argued, “He communicated a brutal empathy  to [his supporters], rooted not in statistics, empiricism or meticulously acquired information,  but an uninhibited t alent for rage, impatience and the attribution of blame.”101 Ultimately,  news consumers “face a tradeoff: they have a private incentive to consume precise and  unbiased news, but they also receive psychological utility from confirmatory news.”102     As we will discuss in Part Two, the emotional allure of situating ourselves within our filter  bubbles and having our worldviews supported and reinforced by ‘confirmatory news’ is  incredibly powerful. Finding solutions to this is going to require a mixture of technolo gical and  educational solutions and, ultimately, a psychological shift whereby one -sided media diets are  deemed socially unacceptable.                                                           98 Lakoff, George (1997).

  43     Communication as Ritual   When town criers announced news to crowds, runners read newspapers aloud in  coffeehouses and f amilies listened to or watched the evening news together, news  consumption was largely a collective experience. However, news consumption has slowly  evolved into an individual behavior with the emergence of portable radios and television and,  more recently , the ubiquitous adoption of laptops, tablets and smartphones.     But while we might physically consume the news alone, what we choose to consume is  increasingly visible because of social media. The posts that we like or comment on and the  articles, videos o r podcast episodes we share are all public. Borrowing from Erving Goffman’s  metaphor of life as theatre, invariably, when we use social media to share news, we become  performers.103 Whatever we like or share is often visible to our network of friends, family  and  acquaintances, and it affects their perceptions of us.104   If social media is a stage, our behaviour is a performance and our circle of friends or followers  are our audience. Goffman thinks our goal for this performance is to manage our audience’s  perce ption of us.105 Therefore, we tend to like or share things on social media that our friends  or followers would expect us to like or share —or, in other words, what we would normally  like or share.106    Similarly, as Maffesoli argued in his 1996 book The Time of the Tribes107, to understand  someone’s behavior, one must consider the sociological implications of the many different,  small and temporary groups that he or she is a member of at any given time of day.  Maffesoli’s writings aptly describe the realities of us ers who have to navigate different online  groups throughout the day, deciding what information to post or share to different ‘tribes’  online and off.     This tribal mentality partly explains why many social media users distribute dis-information   when they don’t necessarily trust the veracity of the information they are sharing: they would  like to conform and belong to a group, and they ‘perform’ accordingly.108 The pressure to  conform can become particularly strong when algorithms on social platfor ms suppress views                                                    103 Goffman, E, (1956) The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.

  44     opposing those of the user. Even if a user has a politically diverse circle of friends or followers,  what she sees in her newsfeed or timeline does not necessarily reflect that diversity.     This connects with the theory of motivated cognit ion, which refers to the unconscious  tendency of individuals to process information to fit conclusions that suit some internal goal.  The classic example comes from the 1950s, when psychologists asked students from two Ivy  League colleges to watch a film of  a football game between their schools that featured a set  of controversial officiating calls. The students from each school were more likely to see the  referees’ calls as correct when it favored their school than when it favored their rival. The  researche rs concluded that the emotional stake the students had in affirming their loyalty to  their respective institutions shaped what they saw on the tape.109    Yale University’s Dan Kahan and colleagues demonstrated motivated cognition in a political  context. They found that, on issues such as a gun control or climate change, participants  would do mathematical somersaults with available data to ‘prove’ the point of view  supported by their own politics.110 Kahan argues that while it’s tempting to fixate on the ‘lazy  brain’ theory – that humans rely heavily on mental shortcuts to compensate for the vast  amount of information they encounter every day –  humans are instead making decisions  about what position is most appropriate to publicly support. He concludes: “Work on  motivated cognition and political conflict tends to focus more on the need for maintaining a  valued identity, particularly as a member of a group… But the seeming inability of economic  interests to explain who believes what on issues such as climate change , the HPV vaccine ,  economic policies that include tax cuts or social welfare spending and the like is in fact the  motivation for examining the contribution that identity -protective forms of mot ivated  cognition make.”111    Communication as Transmission   In a study by Van Dammes and Smets in 2014, they remind us that the “human memory is not  a recording device, but rather a process of (re)construction that is vulnerable to both internal  and external i nfluences .”112     The challenge for the human brain today is how these influences work in the context of social  networks that are bombarding us with information, pinging us repeatedly via the  smartphones in our pockets. As WikiMedia testified to the UK Parlia ment, “Our minds have                                                    109 Kahan, D. (2011) What is Motivated Reasoning and How Does It Work?

  45     always been a battleground for various social forces, but the sheer number of agents and  institutions vying for control of our thoughts and feelings today is so large that it is confusing  and destabilising for many.”113   Filippo Menczer ’s114 most recent research highlights the challenges of our brains to make  decisions about credibility when the streams of information are overwhelming.  In other  words, normal people are too distracted by a deluge of information to find the most accurate  stories: “There are a hundred more stories you’re not seeing that are much better than those  five that you thought were good.” So, according to this research, irrespective of echo  chambers and confirmation bias, people are not sharing verified stories in par t because they  never see them.   According to research115 116 conducted before the heavy use of social media that we take for  granted today, people used a set of key heuristics, or mental shortcuts, when evaluating the  credibility of a source or message:   1. Reputation.  Based on recognition and familiarity   2. Endorsement.  Whether others find it credible   3. Consistency.  Whether the message is echoed by multiple sites   4. Expectancy violation.  Whether a website looks and behaves in the expected  manner   5. Self-confirmation.  Whether a message confirms one’s beliefs   6. Persuasive intent.  The intent of the source in creating the message     When we consider these heuristics in the context of our heavy reliance on social media as a  source of information, the issues we see in this cur rent age of mis - and dis -information  become less surprising.   A very recent meta -analysis117 of the psychological efficacy of messages countering misinformation  provides an excellent overview of the research literature pertaining to debunks  and how they impa ct people’s perceptions of mis-information . The review of the literature                                                    113 Evidence Provided to the UK Parliamentary Inquiry on Fake News by WIkiMedia UK,  http://data.parlia ment.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/culture -media -and-sport committee/fake -news/written/48122.html   114 Qiu, X. et al.

  46     underlined that the effects of a debunking effect were weaker when audiences generated  reasons in support of the initial mis-information , supporting what we know about the power  of co nfirmation bias and motivated reasoning.    People are not incentivised to click out of social media to view an article in its original form.  As such, the cue of ‘expectancy violation’ (whether the site behaves as expected) and  ‘consistency’ (whether the in formation is supported by multiple sites) are unlikely to be  utilized.   A most troubling finding from social media studies is how powerful ‘familiarity’ is as a  persuasive factor.118 As Paul and Matthews discuss in their 2016 paper on the methods by  which Rus sia effectively creates a ‘firehose of falsehood’, repetition is one of the most  effective techniques for getting people to accept mal - and dis -information.   The repetition component is particularly problematic on social media due to people trying to  manip ulate the platforms through bots that automatically “like” or “share” stories or ‘click  farms’. These techniques can create false sense of popularity about content, and, by tagging  influential people like celebrities, politicians or even journalists, impac t the news cycle. A  disturbing recent report by Trend Micro119 outlines the varied ways that influence is being  bought, and the ways in which click farms are being used to boost hashtags, game online  petitions, skew online comment and create fake accounts.   Cues like ‘endorsement’ also become more salient on social media. Our ability to immediately  see whether friends and family have liked, shared, commented or retweeted a piece of  content becomes a powerful influence on our credibility judgments. As researche rs have  shown 120, if you find out your friends like a song, you’ll be more likely to like it too. Human  beings are drawn to follow the masses, particularly when the mass is shown to include your  closest friends and family. As Jonathan Stray explains, “messa ges received in greater volume  and from more sources will be more persuasive. Quantity does indeed have a quality all its  own… [R]eceiving a message via multiple modes and from multiple sources increases the  message’s perceived credibility, especially if a  disseminating source is one with which an  audience member identifies.”121                                                      118 Pennycook, G. et al (July 5, 2017) Prior Exposure Increases Perceived Accuracy of Fake News, Available at  SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2958246   119 Gu, L., V.

  47     The heuristic of self -confirmation now is also especially powerful, now that social networks  are the dominant form of information dissemination. Back in 2006, research by Taber and  Lodge122 showed the powerful effect of prior attitudes upon reasoning. Attitudinally  congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments.  The algorithmic filtering that makes us much less likely to come across information that  challenges us (see the section below on filter bubbles and echo chambers) means that the  selective exposure that humans tend toward (as it requires less cognitive ‘work’) is done for  us automatically.   In addition to self -confirmation bias, humans are also af fected by motivated reasoning and a  desire to be vindicated. As Sunstein et al.123 found, people who believed in man -made climate  change updated their beliefs more in response to bad news (e.g. temperatures are going up  more than expected), whereas those who  disbelieved man -made climate change were more  responsive to good news. Therefore, beliefs were only changed in ways that cemented what  they already thought to be true.   This is linked to recent research trying to replicate the so -called backfire effect, wh ich was  first proposed in 2010124 to account for fact -checks that appeared to harden people’s beliefs  about false information. The researchers were unable to replicate the backfire effect and  found that corrections and fact -checks do nudge people toward the truth.   Specifically, their research found that, while Trump supporters were more resistant to  nudging, they were nudged all the same. And there was another clear pattern of Trump  supporters: corrections didn’t change participants’ feelings about Trump. As  one of the  researchers, Brendan Nyhan, explained, “People were willing to say Trump was wrong, but it  didn’t have much of an effect on what they felt about him.”125 The takeaway is that, while  facts make an impression, they just don’t matter for our decisio n-making —a conclusion that  has a great deal of support in the psychological sciences.126                                                      122 Taber, C. and M. Lodge, (2006) Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs,  American  Journal of Political Science, Vol. 50, No. 3 (Jul., 2006), pp. 755 -769  123 Sunstein, C. R. , et al. (2016).

  48     The research on how best to word and visual ise fact -checks and debunks is varied and at  times contradictory.127 Much of this research is US -focused, concerned with political fact checks and mostly carried out on American undergraduate students. It’s vital that more  studies are replicated in different  geographical settings, using mis-information  in other  areas —particularly health and science.     There is currently a great deal of discussion about increasing funding for individual news  literacy programs, as well as integrating core elements into national  curricula.  We would  argue those programs and curricula should include discussions of how to override the human  tendency to seek out information that supports our worldview and ‘tribal identifications’,  how to beat confirmation bias and how to be skeptica l of information which produces an  emotional response.     In this first section, we introduced new conceptual frameworks for discussing and researching  information disorder, outlining the three types, elements and phases of information disorder:     i) The three types : mis -, dis- and mal -information   ii) The three elements : agents, messages and interpreters   iii) The three phases : creation, production and dissemination     We need to be much more precise about the definitions we use to describe the phenomenon  of information dis order, if we are to begin understanding how and why it is created, the forms  that it takes, and its impact. We also need to understand how characteristics change as  information flows through the different phases, and how the person who interprets a  particu lar message can become an agent in their own right as they go on to re -share that  message with their ow n networks. In the following section, we discuss the challenges of filter  bubbles and echo chambers, underlining the importance of considering how people  discover  information and share it with their own networks, and the need to study the wider  implications for public discourse.                                                           127 An excellent overview of some of the literature can be found here: Flynn, D.J. & Nyhan, Brendan & Reifler,  Jason.

  49     Part 2: Challenges of filter bubbles and echo chambers   ‘The “public sphere”: the shared spaces – real, virtual or imagined – whereby social issues are  discussed and public opinion is formed ’. This theory was first shared by the German  sociologist and philosopher Jurgen  Habermas, who argued that a healthy public sphere is  essential for democracy and must be inclusive, representat ive and characterised  by respect  for rational argument.128  The most significant challenge to any theory of a shared public  sphere is that humans, when we have a choice about who to connect with or not, tend to  establish and continue relationships with peopl e who have views similar to our own. We are  programmed to enjoy spending time in ‘echo chambers,’ as it requires less cognitive work.   There is no doubt that digital technologies support us in these tendencies. In his 1998 essay,  Which Technology and Which  Democracy?, Benjamin Barber wrote, “Digitalization is, quite  literally, a divisive, even polarizing, epistemological strategy… It creates knowledge niches for  niche markets and customizes data in ways that can be useful to individuals but does little for  common ground… [I]t obstructs the quest for common ground necessary to representative  democracy and indispensable to strong democracy.”129 At the same time, MIT Media Lab  founder Nicholas Negroponte started a discussion about what this very human set of  beha viours would look like online. In ‘The Daily Me’, a thought experiment, he considered the  implications of completely personalised newspapers. And, in 2006, Habermas acknowledged  the challenge for the public sphere in the era of the internet. He argued, “[T ]he rise of millions  of fragmented chat rooms across the world has tended instead to lead to the fragmentation  of large but politically focused mass audiences into a huge number of isolated issue  publics.”130     These ideas moved into the mainstream in 2011 w ith the publication of Eli Pariser’s book, the  Filter Bubble131. By that point, Negroponte’s thought experiment had become a reality with  Facebook’s Newsfeed, and Pariser was able to explain how the social technology companies  have engineered personalised ex periences. Using algorithms to deliver content that we are  mostly likely to enjoy, these platforms reinforce our worldviews and allow us to stay encased  in our safe, comfortable echo chambers.   It is worth recounting here James Carey’s description of the ‘r itual view of communication’,                                                    128 Habermas, J.

  50     which is not about “the act of imparting information but the representation of shared  beliefs.” Appreciating this truth helps us explain why echo chambers are so appealing. They  provide safe spaces for sharing beliefs and worl dviews with others, with little fear of  confrontation or division. They allow us to ‘perform’ our identities as shaped by our  worldviews with others who share those worldviews. This behaviour is not new, but the  platforms have capitalized on these human te ndencies, knowing they would encourage users  to spend more time on their sites.   Agents who are creating dis-information  understand that, when people consume and share  these messages, they will be doing so increasingly from inside these echo chambers, with no  one to challenge the ideas. This means the people who will interpret their messages are much  less likely to have an ‘oppositional’ (rejecting the way the message was encoded) or  ‘negotiated’ (accepting only some aspects of the message) reading. As such,  agents target  groups that they know are more likely to be receptive to the message. If they are successful in  doing that, it is very likely the message will then be shared by the initial recipient. And, as  research shows, we are much more likely to trust a message coming from someone we  know132, even if we suspect it to be false. This is why dis-information  can be disseminated so  quickly. It is travelling between peer -to-peer networks where trust tends to be high.133    The fundamental problem is that “filter bu bbles” worsen polarization by allowing us to live in  our own online echo chambers and leaving us with only opinions that validate, rather than  challenge, our own ideas. While confirmation bias occurs offline and the term ‘selective  exposure’ has been used by social scientists for decades to describe how information seekers  use only certain sources that share their views,134 social media are designed to take  advantage of this innate bias.     The rise in popularity of social networks as sources of news has taken place at the same time  as a decline in local newspapers in some of the largest democracies in the world.  In the U.S.,  Canada and the U.K. particularly, the local news ecosystem is struggling as the advertising  model for news has collapsed. Many local newsrooms have been forced to make serious staff  cuts, consolidate or close. In the U.K.,  there has been a net loss of approximately two hundred  local newspaper titles since 2005135 In Canada a study commissioned by Friends of Canadian  Broadcasting warned the Canadian Radio -television and Telecommunications Commission                                                    132 Metzger et al.

  51     that “without intervention, half of Canada’s small and medium -market television stations  could disappear by 2020.”136  And in a Columbia Journalism Review article  the scale o f US  News deserts was spelled out very clearly, showing how many cities have been left  with just  one local newspaper, and how many have  none at all.137 As ad revenue moves to Google and  Facebook  (in the mobile ad market these two companies earn early half of  all revenue138),  it  is expected that the same patterns witnessed in these countries will be felt in many other  countries in the next few years .    In 2009, the U.S. -based Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities in a  Democracy concluded that  information is “as vital to the healthy functioning of communities  as clean air, safe streets, good schools, and public health.”139 While there no evidence yet to  directly connect the decline of local news media to the rise in information pollution, when  strong local media do not exist other sources will fill that vacuum.     As Nina Jankowicz, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute wrote in an  opinion piece in the New York Times recently:     Without news that connects people to their town counc ils or county fair, or  stories that analyze how federal policies affect local businesses, people are left  with news about big banks in New York and dirty politics in Washington ….  Readers compare this coverage with their dwindling bank balances and  crumblin g infrastructure and feel disconnected and disenfranchised, and latch  onto something — anything — that speaks to them. That might be President  Trump’s tweets. Or dubious “news” from an extreme right - or left -wing site  might ring true. Or they might turn to  Russian disinformation, which exploits  this trust gap.140    Local news outlets provide a shared experience for a community. When communities rely on  individual feeds of news from their social networks, these shared experiences disappear. We  need more researc h to understand the implications of this in terms of people sharing mis - and  dis-information.                                                      136 Lindgren, A., J.

  52     As discussed, the technology companies are commercial entities, and therefore to keep their  shareholders happy need to  encourage users to stay on their site for as long as possible to  maximize the number of exposures to advertisements. They do so by tweaking the algorithms  to deliver more of what users have liked, shared or commented on in the past. So, while we  have seen  the technology companies take some steps to fight dis-information  on their  platforms (see Part 3), ultimately, it’s difficult to imagine them making substantive changes to  their algorithms to pop these filter bubbles. If the platforms changed the algorith m to provide  us with more challenging material that forced us to reconsider some of our established world  views, we are unlikely to spend as much time on them.     As Wired  dramatically concluded in an article just after the US election, “The global village  that was once the internet has been replaced by digital islands of isolation that are drifting  further apart each day. From your Facebook feed to your Google Search, as your experience  online grows increasingly personalized, the internet’s islands grow fart her apart.”141 The  Laboratory for Social Machines at MIT has been investigating filter bubbles, how they form,  and how people can try to break out of them. In research published in December 2016,  tweets sent during the US election were visualized in a networ k that showed almost no  overlap between Trump and Clinton supporters.142 The analysis concluded that, on Twitter,  Trump supporters formed a particularly insular group when talking about politics during the  general election, having few connections to Clinton supporters or the mainstream media.   Figure 1 0: Visualization by the Laboratory for Social Machines at MIT of Donald Trump and  Hillary  Clinton supporters on Twitter                                                     141 El-Bermawy, M.

  53     Research by Demos in the U.K. that analysed British Twitter accounts found similar patterns  between supporters of different political parties. However, they were able to show that  people with more extreme political views tended to engage with a smaller num ber of people  than  those who had more moderate political views.143  Walter Quattrociocchi and his team have studied the dynamics of echo chambers on  Facebook.144 Examining the posts of 1.2 million users, his team analysed mainstream and  conspiracy science news and how they are consumed and shaped by communities on  Facebook. They found that polarized communities emerge around distinct types of content,  and consumers of conspiracy news tended to be extremely focused on specific topics like  climate change.   There ha s also been research that challenges these ideas about the dangers of echo  chambers. A survey of 14,000 people in in seven countries that was published in May 2017145  concluded that “people who are interested and involved in politics online are more likely t o  double -check questionable information they find on the internet and social media, including  by searching online for additional sources in ways that will pop filter bubbles and break out of  echo chambers.”146 In addition, the 2017 Digital News Report, publi shed by the Reuters  Institute for the Study of Journalism, concluded, “Echo chambers and filter bubbles are  undoubtedly real for some, but we also find that – on average – users of social media,  aggregators and search engines experience more diversity than  non-users.”147  Concerns raised since Brexit and the US election have led to new innovations by social  platforms, third -party organizations and academic institutions to help people ‘prick’ their  filter bubbles. With the renewed emphasis on scaling news literacy programs globally,  teaching how social algorithms produce these filter bubbles should be a crucial part of any  standardised curriculum.   Facebook, for example, rolled out a new related -articles feature148 that is designed to show  multiple perspective s on a story. And, during the U.K. and French election, Facebook rolled                                                    143 Krasodomski -Jones, A. (2016) Talking To Ourselv es?

A third -party effort to prick the filter b ubble is PolitEcho150, a Chrome extension that allows  you to plot your Facebook friends on a graph based on their political affiliation, which is  estimated from the news organizations they have liked. Another is Flipfeed151, which allows  you to randomly see th e Twitter feed of someone with a diametrically oppositional view to  your own. As the app claims, watching the ‘Trump news conference’, in the ‘flipped’ mode  can be eye -opening. And yet another Chrome extension, Rbutr152, is a community -driven app  which conne cts webpages on the basis that one page argues against the other.

  55     The Wall Street Journal  was one of the first news outlets to try to find a way for their  audiences and other people interest ed in this concept to compare the way different topics — like Trump, guns, health care, and immigration —were being covered and shared by people  from different political perspectives. They created ‘Blue Feed, Red Feed’153 “to demonstrate  how reality may differ for different Facebook users.” If a source appears in the red feed, a  majority of the articles shared from the source were classified as ‘very conservatively aligned’  in a large 2015 Facebook study. For the blue feed, a majority of each source’s articles a ligned  ‘very liberal.’ These feeds aren’t intended to resemble actual individual news feeds. Instead,  they are rare, side -by-side looks at real conversations from different perspectives.   Buzzfeed  and the Guardian  newspaper have been testing new features th at help readers  navigate alternative viewpoints. BuzzFeed ’s ‘Outside Your Bubble’154 pulls in opinions from  across the web and gives them a neutral platform. Public comments, which can be the most  emotional and combative part of any online story, are then re moved from their normal  context and rephrased as dispassionate bullet points.     The Guardian’s weekly column ‘Burst Your Bubble’155 curates “five conservative articles worth  reading" for the site’s liberal audience.  Similarly, every week, the Washington Post  journalist  Will Sommer publishes a newsletter, ‘Right Richter’,156 which aggregates right -wing  perspectives for left -leaning audiences.   Finally, there is the AllSides site157, whose stated mission is to expose bias and provide  “multiple angles on the same sto ry so you can quickly get the full picture, not just one slant.”  Using a mixture of crowd -driven ratings and its patented algorithms, it’s the newest attempt  to provide audiences with a visual guide to politically slanted journalism.                                                     153 http://graphics.wsj.com/blue -feed-red-feed/   154https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/helping -you-see-outside -yourbubble?utm_term=.lhpjZ5lx2#.yqm1R3wE5   155 https://www.theguardian.com/us -news/series/burst -your-bubble   156 http://tinyletter.com/rightrichter   157 http://allsides.com/  
  56     Figure 1 2: Screenshot  of the Allsides.com website     The ultimate challenge of filter bubbles is re -training our brains to seek out alternative  viewpoints. Some people have likened our informational diet to our nutritional one, claiming  that in the same way as we had to be educa ted to see the value of a diet rich in fruit and  vegetables, we need to give ‘nutritional ‘labels to information so that people understand the  value of a media diet with a variety of political viewpoints. While we can pressure the social  networks to divers ify our diet, we can’t force people to actually click, let alone read the  content. At public events, Facebook has admitted that when they have attempted to deliver  more content from an opposite view, people tend not to click on it.   As this report underline s, we have to think about information consumption from a ritual as  well as transmission perspective. If we recognise that people seek out and consume content  for many reasons beyond simply becoming informed – like feeling connected to similar  people or affiliating with  a specific identify – it means that pricking the filter bubbler requires  more than simply providing diverse information.        
  57     Part 3: Attempts at solutions   One week after the election, Eli Pariser, author of The Filter Bubble , created a public Google  document and asked people to contribute solutions to solve the mis-information  problem.  Within a few weeks, the document was more than 150 pages long and included comments  from over 50 people. The document158 includes many ideas and  can be seen as a  comprehensive blueprint of what solutions are possible.     One point we’d like to stress, however, is that much of the debate about solutions  presupposes communication as information transmission. But this cannot explain or solve the  problem of information disorder.  As Carey suggests, “under a ritual view [of communication]  news is not information but drama”159 and “a portrayal of the contending forces in the  world.”160 Our conversations about solutions will need to evolve in order to rec ognise this  role information plays beyond simply transmitting messages.     Over the past twelve months, potential solutions have been discussed endlessly at  conferences and in workshops, but we’ve seen little concrete changes from the platforms.  While there is certainly more foundation money than there was,161 and a myriad of small  projects are underway, the grand ideas are yet to be implemented. These include Apple’s CEO  Tim Cook call for a Public Service Announcement about dis-information , new labels to ident ify  different types of content on social platforms, systematic programs for taking down bot  accounts, the integration of critical media literacy programs in schools and best practices for  making fact -checks and debunks shareable.     Facebook and Google have announced methods for preventing fabricated sites from making  money through their advertising platforms. However, anecdotally, ‘fake news’ creators have  explained that, while they experienced short term losses in revenue earlier in the year, they  have retu rned their profits to previous levels using other ad networks that are willing to  partner with them.     The only real major development we’ve seen has been the passing of legislation in Germany  that fines platforms for hosting unlawful content, including def amation and incitement to                                                    158 Pariser, E.

  58     hatred , and not removing  such posts within 24 hours.162 And we’re seeing serious discussions  in Singapore about passing a similar law.163    In this next section, we discuss potential solutions from a number of different perspectives — technological, social, media -centric, educational and regulatory.     Technological Approaches     Mis-, dis- and mal -information are incredibly complex phenomena, but the impression that  these problems emerged suddenly during the US election encouraged many to b elieve that a  solution could be found just as quickly. While changing underlying socio -economic and  cultural factors takes time, the allure of an easy algorithmic tweak meant it became the  popular solution. Certainly, in the crowd -sourced ‘Design Solutions ’ Google document started  by Eli Pariser, discussions about technological solutions dominate.164 Even Krishna Bharat, the  engineer responsible for building Google News, stepped in and wrote a detailed piece about  the technical ways in which the platforms could detect mis - and dis -information in real  time.165  What have the social networks done?   As we h ave seen, one of the primary motivations for creating dis-information  is financial gain.  Google has therefore worked to prevent revenue flowing to the owners of “bad sites, scams  and ads” and has permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from its AdSense ad vertising  network as of late 2016.166 Facebook made similar moves, updating its policies with language  stating they would not display ads that show misleading or illegal content.  Facebook has also  taken steps to tackle ‘imposter content’, stating, “On the bu ying side, we’ve taken action  against the ability to spoof domains, which will reduce the prevalence of sites that pretend to  be real publications.”167  And, in late August 2017, Facebook announced they would block ads  from pages that had repeatedly shared f alse news, stating “Currently, we do not allow  advertisers to run ads that link to stories that have been marked false by third -party fact                                                   162 Eddy, M. and M.

  59     checking organizations. Now we are taking an additional step. If Pages repeatedly share  stories marked as false, thes e repeat offenders will no longer be allowed to advertise on  Facebook.”168  Google News recently took steps to allow publishers to highlight fact -checked content for  programmatic detection using schema.org, a structured data markup schema supported by  the maj or search engines. This feature first appeared in the U.K. and the US last October, and  has since been added to Google News in Germany, France, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.   Google News Lab, which is distinct from Google News and whose mission is to collab orate  with journalists and entrepreneurs to help build the future of media, has been very active in  this space over the past couple of years.169 For example, the News Lab was a founding partner  of First Draft when it began in June 2015.   Facebook moved, from Mark Zuckerberg’s post -election denial170 that ‘fake news’ was a  problem on his platform, to rolling out a third -party fact -checking initiative on December 15,  2016 that includes the International Fact Checking Network, The Associated Press , The  Washington P ost and Snopes.171 They expanded the project to France and Germany in  February and the Netherlands in March. In this initiative, users flag posts they think might be  ‘false news’, populating a queue that the affiliated fact -checking organizations can see. Af ter  an article has been fact -checked, any user who sees that content will see that it has been  disputed by one of the fact -checking organizations. If someone tries to share a disputed  article, they are reminded with a pop -up notice that the content is in d ispute.   The initiative was widely welcomed when launched, although there were dissenting voices,  such as Data & Society’s Robyn Caplan who raised concerns about the challenge of writing  algorithms to identify this type of content when the definitions are s o broad. She also spoke  out about the need to financially support this outsourced journalism.172   While there is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that many types of ‘nudge’                                                    168 Shukla, S.

  60     technologies can slow sharing,173 and researchers, in experimental settings, have found that  warning labels and pop -up boxes slow down the sharing of this content174 without access to  the results of this Facebook initiative  we have no independent way of knowing whether the  program is slowin g down the spread of polluted information  on the platform . Despite  repeated calls for access to this data, most powerfully from the fact -checkers themselves, to  date Facebook have refused to share the numbers. I t’s therefore impossible to assess the  succes s of the project.   Expe rimental research by Leticia Bo de in 2015 suggested that when a Facebook post that  includes mis-information  is immediately contextualised in their ‘related stories’ feature  underneath, misperceptions are significantly reduced.175 In Au gust 2017, Facebook  announced176 that they would be rolling out their related stories feature more widely to help  contextualize mis-information  with fact -checked articles.   In January 2017, Facebook launched its ‘Facebook Journalism Project’177 and announced th at  news literacy would be a priority for the company. Beyond financially supporting non -profits  working in this space, they also rolled out a Public Service Announcement -type message at  the top of the New Feed in fourteen countries. This message linked to a post with 10 top tips  for spotting ‘false news’.178 These same tips were published as full page ads in newspapers in  Germany, France and the U.K. They also committed a $14 million fund to help establish the  News Integrity Initiative based at the CUNY Journ alism School in New York, which supports  the development of tools, research and media literacy programs globally.179   However, in a post titled ‘Facebook Must Either Innovate o r Admit Defeat At The Hands Of  Fake News Hoaxsters’, Craig Silverman had some stro ng words for the platform:   [If Facebook] “is truly committed to offering a quality Trending Topic (and News Feed)  experience, its only option is to make massive strides in the detection and analysis of  the factual qualities of news articles.

  61     algorithm to do this job with accuracy and consistency will require significant  engineering resources. But it’s what is necessary to actually stop Facebook from being  the world’s biggest platform for false and fake ne ws without the use of editors. Right  now Facebook has no editors, a flawed algorithm, and a weak product.”180   Facebook closed 30,000 automated accounts in France ahead of the election and ‘tens of  thousands’ in the U.K. ahead of their election. To date, the se kinds of moves by Facebook  have timed with elections, but there are calls for Facebook to take an ongoing approach to  policing automation on the platform.181   As discussed, the challenge of bots disseminating dis-information  is a significant one. Ongoing  research by the Computational Propaganda Project182 at the Oxford Internet Institute  continues to identify the scale of the problem globally. In April 2017, Facebook’s Security  team published a paper on ‘Information Operations’, defining it as “actions taken  by  organized actors (governments or non -state actors) to distort domestic or foreign political  sentiment, most frequently to achieve a strategic and/or geopolitical outcome.”183 It was the  first-time  Facebook had admitted the scale of the problem they face in terms of official,  tightly organised, networked agents using their platform to disseminate automated disinformation .   In September 2017, Facebook admitted that they had found evidence that ‘dark  ads’ (ads that  are only visible to the intended audience, rather than publicly viewable on a page) had been  purchased by a Russian organization and directed at US citizens. Facebook explained, “[T]he  ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisi ve social and political messages across  the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to  immigration to gun rights.”184 A few days later, an investigation by the Daily Beast found  inauthentic accounts, seemingly located in Ru ssia, had used the Facebook events function to  organize anti -immigration protests in the US.185  While Facebook is struggling on this topic, Twitter’s open APIs mean it is much easier for  academics and think tanks to visualise the bot networks that exist on t heir platform. Thus,                                                    180 Silverman, C.

  62     calls for action have been focused on Twitter. In a June 2017 blog post, Twitter explained its  efforts to fight against bots: “We’re working hard to detect spammy behaviors at source, such  as the mass distribution of Tweets or attempts  to manipulate trending topics. We also reduce  the visibility of potentially spammy Tweets or accounts while we investigate whether a policy  violation has occurred. When we do detect duplicative, or suspicious activity, we suspend  accounts. We also frequen tly take action against applications that abuse the public API to  automate activity on Twitter186, stopping potentially manipulative bots at the source.”187  Ultimately, the question remains as to whether the social networks and technology  companies, as commerc ial entities, can ever spearhead serious solutions to the problem of  information disorder. As Martin Moore, Director of the Center for the Study of Media,  Communication and Power argued in his submission of evidence to the U.K. Parliamentary  Select Committ ee on Fake News:   “Remedies solely or heavily based on technological fixes or market -driven corrections  will not, on their own, address these problems. Technology should be able to reduce  the spread of certain types of news (such as that which is shared wit hout being read  first), and to show where news is disputed. However, the long history of fake news,  the political, social and economic motivations for producing it, and the ease of self publishing online, mean that technology will only ever partly address the problem. It  also elicits dangers of its own with regard to the value -driven choices that engineers  will have to make when determining which news to promote and which to suppress.  Nor are market -driven corrections likely to solve, or even alleviate, the  problem. The  technology platforms on which this news travels are reliant on advertising that  prioritises popular and engaging content that is shared widely. The content is not  distinguished by its trustworthiness, authority or public interest, since these  are not  criteria that drive likes and shares.”   Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism argues, “The business of  publishing and monetizing information is never neutral; it is always deeply political. It shapes  opinion, informs market s, reinforces biases, creates understanding, and spreads confusion.  Facebook has said more than once that it does not want to be an arbiter of the truth, but it  also does not want to be the purveyor of lies. Journalists have known for a long time what  tech nology companies are just finding out: what you don’t publish is as brand -defining as  what you do.”188                                                    186 Twitter, (April 6 , 2016) Automation Rules, https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915   187 Crowell, C., (June 14, 2017) Our Approach to Bots and Automation,   https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2017/Our -Approach -Bots-Mis-information.html   188 Bell, E.

  63     In addition to these steps to shut down automated accounts by the social networks, the  ability to identify and discredit sources of dis-information in  real time is an increasingly  necessary skill for newsrooms to master. We hope technology companies will support  newsrooms in being able to identify the agents of a post. If newsrooms were provided with  the tools to identify whether the agents of a piece of dis -information are official, organised  and automated, they would be able to quickly raise red flags for audiences.   When assessing moves by  the technology companies over the past year, one of the most  frustrating elements has been the failure to connect with the research, education, library, civil  society,  and policy communities at  any substantive level. There are  decades of research on  mis-information , how people ‘read’ and make sense of information, the factors that slow  down or exacerbate rumours. But the r esponses have often felt knee -jerk and atheoretical ,  and at times  public relations moves rather than serious attempts to tackle the complexity of  the problem. On this topic, when the scale and seriousness require sophisticated responses,  the technology companies must work more closely with those who have research expertise  on this subject , as well as those working on the ground around the world , and experience  first-hand  the real -world repercussions of information pollution.    Blacklisting , flagging and credibility scores   Creating lists of problematic sites was an early and popular suggestion, but as US academic  Melissa Zimdars found to her detriment189, attempting to be the ‘arbiter of truth’ can cause  you to become incredibly unpopular. Not ably, her list, now hosted at opensources.co, has  been used by a number of technologists building tools to help ‘flag’ problematic content  through browser extensions such as Check This190. One such tool from the French daily  newspaper  Le Monde  is based on a database of sites reviewed by Le Monde ’s fact -checkers  and191allows readers to search a website’s URL to check whether it has published unreliable  content.  The goal of most of these projects is to build a system that could be integrated with  Google and Faceb ook and used to down -rank certain content from ‘less credible’ sources so  that users are less likely to see it.   Recently, the social news agency Storyful teamed up with the advertising analytics firm Moat  and CUNY Journalism School to create the Open Bran d Safety Framework, an attempt to  create the master black list of ‘fake news’ sites that advertisers can avoid.192 The desire for  advertising companies to stay away from problematic content has become increasingly clear                                                    189 Zimdars, M.

  64     over the past few months, as the success of the online activist group Sleeping Giants193  demonstrates.194  Categorising content, while seemingly a well -mea ning exercise for providing people with  additional context, can quickly backfire when people question the authority of those who  create the labels. Indeed, one can easily imagine algorithms programmed to identify, de -rank  or take down certain types of cont ent might produce unintended consequences. A  clampdown on dis-information  should not become an excuse for suppressing dissenting or  minority views. An organization labelling something as ‘fake’ should provide full transparency  around how it makes its ‘blac klists.’   Credibility scores   In conversations about mis-information , there are regular comparisons drawn between  deceptive articles and email spam. Questions are often raised about why techniques similar to  those used to combat email spam can’t be used to i dentify and down -rank poor quality  content.   The Trust Project195, led by Sally Lehrman at Santa Clara University, has been working on a set  of criteria that would help audiences know what content to trust. Standards include whether  an outlet has a correction s policy and whether a reporter has written on the topic previously.  The hope is that if newsrooms added this information as metadata to online articles,  Facebook and Google could ‘read’ these signals and place them higher algorithmically.   There are also t wo US -based projects working on credibility: the Technical Schema for  Credibility196, led by Meedan in collaboration with Hacks/Hackers, and the News Quality Score  Project, led by Frederic Filloux197. The projects are developing markers of credibility, to see if  there can be a programmatic way for social networks use their scores to influence algorithmic  rankings.   Stronger media     CUNY Journalism Professor Jeff Jarvis has said “our problem  isn’t ‘fake news.’ Our problem  is                                                    193 https://www.facebook.com/slpnggiants/   194 Alba, D.

  65     trust.”198 As has been well documented, trust in mainstream media has been falling for  decades, as has (it must be noted) trust in other public institutions.199 Ethan Zuckerman’s  recent essay on the topic describes the slow decline of trust:     “Addressing the current state of mistrust in journalism  will require addressing the  broader crisis of trust in institutions. Given the timeline of this crisis, which is  unfolding over decades, it is unlikely that digital technologies are the primary actor  responsible for the surprises of the past year. While d igital technologies may help us  address issues, like a disappearing sense of common ground, the underlying issues of  mistrust likely require close examination of the changing nature of civics and public  attitudes to democracy.”200    It’s worth recognizing how  trust in journalism varies geographically. Recent comparative  analysis by the Reuters Institute in its annual Digital News Report201 shows how news media  enjoy different levels of trust in different countries:     Figure 1 3: From the Digital News Report, 2017  by the Reuters Institute for the Study of  Journalism - Overall Trust in the News Media   There are many reasons for the decline of trust in media. Improving these numbers is not  going to happen quickly, but initiatives to help build trust and credibility go  hand in hand with  any initiatives aiming to combat mis - and dis -information.                                                      198 Jarvis, J.

  66     Strategic Silence   As Data & Society outlined in their May 2017 report Media Manipulation and Dis-information   Online, “ for manipulators, it doesn’t matter if the media is report ing on a story in order to  debunk or dismiss it; the important thing is getting it covered in the first place.”202 Certainly,   during the weekend of the #MacronLeaks, Ryan Broderick of Buzzfeed reported that  members of 4Chan discussion boards were linking to stories debunking the information, and  celebrating them as a form of engagement.203 While reporting on these stories, and the  people behind the stories, feels a natural response by journalists  at this point in time, there is  a real need for the industry to c ome together to discuss the impact of reporting on disinformation , and providing oxygen for rumours or fabricated content that otherwise would  stay in niche communities online. We would recommend cross -industry meetings whereby  senior editors could discus s whether there is a need to reach a shared agreement on when a  rumour or piece of content crosses a tipping point, and moves from niche online communities  to a wider audience. The French rules which prevented any discussion of election related  topics for the forty -eight hours before the polls closed, meant there was no discussion of the  leaks by the mainstream media in France, something which raised eyebrows amongst US  journalists. The idea of strategic silence in the coverage of mal - and dis -information m ight sit  uncomfortably with some, but we would argue there is a need for these conversations to take  place.     Identifying the sources of dis-information   In Paul & Matthews report on Russian propaganda for the RAND corporation, they argue that  one of the mo st effective ways of tackling the issue is to inoculate users, or to “forewarn  audiences of mis-information , or merely reach them first with the truth, rather than  retracting or refuting false ‘facts.’204    However, the current trend is fact -checking initiatives.205 Since 2016, we have seen the  creation of numerous fact -checking organizations, new teams206 and election -based initiatives  like CrossCheck,207 which worked to debunk rumours and claims around the French election.  The difficulty here is that if “f ake news isn’t about facts, but about power, then independent  fact-checking alone won’t fix it — particularly for readers who already distrust the                                                    202 Marwick, A and R.

  67     organizations that are doing the fact -checking.”208 (Borel, 2017)   However, as Jeff Jarvis argues, there are oth er techniques which are not currently a natural  part of reporting.  For example, “journalism should cover the manipulators’ methods but not  their messages…. We should not assume that all our tried -and-true tools  — articles,  explainers, fact -checking  — can counteract manipulators’ propaganda. We must experiment  and learn what does and does not persuade people to favor facts and rationality.” (Jarvis,  2017)   A Belgium start -up, Saper Vedere  is making a similar claim, based on its analysis of the  effectiveness of fact -checks during the French election209. In its visualisation below, one can  see the audience for the rumour that Macron was funded by Saudi Arabia, as well as the  audience of its debunk. There is almost no overlap between these two groups.   Figure 1 4: Visualization of Twitter accounts discussion a rumour that Emmanuel Macron was being  funded by Saudi Arabia. The accounts on the left in the green box were discussing the debunk. The  account in red were discussing the rumour. The two communities hardly ove rlap. Credit: Alexandre  Alaphilippe and Nicolas Vanderbiest .  Instead,  they argue that journalists need better tools to be able to identify the sources of disinformation  in real -time : source -checking. When bot accounts who originated a rumour  appear to be based in a country other than the one connected with said rumour, it could  prove to be a faster way of encouraging skepticism in the audience than debunking the fact  itself.                                                     208 Borel, B. (Jan. 4, 2017) Fact -checking Won’t Save Us from Fake News, FiveThirtyEight ,  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fact -checking -wont -save-us-from -fake-news/   209 http://www.saper -vedere.eu/   
  68       Education   In a large -scale exercise designed to evaluate students’ ability to evaluate information sources  online, researchers at Stanford University were surprised by the degree to which respondents  were unable to identify an advert from editorial content or question the partisan  nature of  facts presented to them.210  The call for more news literacy programs211  has been deafening  recently, and they are one solution on which almost everyone can agree.     danah boyd in a provocative piece titled ‘Did Media Literacy Backfire’ from Januar y 2017  argued media literacy has actually taught students not to trust Wikipedia while failing to give  them sufficient critical research skills to know how to ascertain the credibility of any one piece  of information.212 boyd identified a significant problem : news literacy has been distorted into  distrust of the media and selective research that reaffirm s beliefs.     The specifics of how such programs should be rolled out, in terms of the format, structure and  content of program curriculum, have supported very vibrant discussions. In addition  to more   traditional ideas around news literacy, such as  how to differentiate between opinion and hard  news, there have been calls to include elements like the critical assessment of statistical and  quantitative statements in the media213, a deep understanding of algorithms and artificial  intelligence214 and greater emotional skepticism .215     There is also a need to educate people on the power of images to manipulate and persuade.  As discussed earlier, the way we understand visuals is fundamentally different to how we  think about text. While much of the ‘fake news’ debate to date has been about text -based  dis-information , the election monitoring projects First Draft has worked on in the US, UK,  France and Germany have shown how frequently dis-information  appears in visual formats — whether doctored images, fabricated videos, misleading visual izations or ‘memes’ (striking  images with text superimposed over top). In an investigation carried out in the run up to the  French election, Buzzfeed discovered loose networks of US teenagers creating ‘meme shells’                                                    210 Stanford History Education Group, (Nov. 22, 2016) Evaluation Information: The Cornerstone of Civic Online  Reasoning. https://sheg.stanford.edu/upload/V3LessonPlans/Executive%20Summary%2011.21.16.pdf   211 This document from 1999 titl ed ‘7 Great Debates in Media Literacy, is still incredibly relevant’  http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED439454.pdf   212 boyd, d.

  69     (generic images related to the candidates ) that anyone could use to create memes for social  media.     A recent study at Stanford University observed 10 Ph.D. historians, 10 professional fact  checkers and 25 Stanford University undergraduates as they evaluated live websites and  searched for informat ion on social and political issues. They found that “historians and  students often fell victim to easily manipulated features of websites, such as official -looking  logos and domain names. They read vertically, staying within a website to evaluate its  relia bility. In contrast, fact checkers read laterally, leaving a site after a quick scan and  opening  new browser tabs in order to judge the credibility of the original site. Compared to  the other groups, fact checkers arrived at more warranted conclusions in a fraction of the  time.”216     The question is how to make this type of ‘reading’ habitual amongst s tudents.   Ultimately, there is an acceptance that any curriculum should not lecture students. Telling  students they are wrong is not a solution, and may even be counter -productive. As InformAll  and the CILIP Information Literacy Group testified to the UK P arliament, “[t]he essence of any  solution lies in stimulating curiosity and a spirit of enquiry, and crucially, finding effective  ways of triggering this curiosity, in the education system and beyond.”217    One of the most impressive initiatives is The Digita l Polarization Initiative218, which was  launched by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities and is led by Mike  Caulfield. It is a national effort to build student civic, information and web literacy by having  students participating in a b road, cross -institutional project to fact -check, annotate and  provide context to the different news stories that show up in their Twitter and Facebook  feeds. As Caulfield explains: “The point is to get students to understand the mechanisms and  biases of Fa cebook and Twitter in ways that most digital literacy programs never touch. The  point is not to simply decode what’s out there, but to analyze what is missing from our  current online environment, and, if possible supply it.”219    Programs that have focused on  critical thinking, source evaluation and emotional  manipulation have seen  success.  In Ukraine, the nongovernmental organization IREX, trained  15,000 people on a program  called Learn to Discern, which was  designed to teach citizens                                                    216 McGrew, S., T.

  70     how to separate fact fro m fiction and recognize manipulation and hate speech.  In their  evaluation of the project, they found an observed 24% increase in participants’ ability to  distinguish trustworthy news from false  news, a 22% increase in those who cross -check the  information  in the news they consume, and a 26% increase in participants' confidence in  analyzing news.220     Established programs like the News Literacy Project221, which is focused on providing  materials and curricula to High School students; the Stonybrook Center for News Literacy222,  which offers skills training to University students; and a new online course being offered by  Hong Kong University223 are all also currently leading the thinking on best practices in this  area.     It seems there is a need for a task force on t he best approaches for teaching news literacy,  creative thinking about a standardized curriculum and rigorous testing of new techniques.  Suggested elements of any curriculum include: (i) traditional news literacy skills; (ii) forensic  social media verifica tion skills; (iii) information about the power of algorithms to shape what  is presented to us; (iv) the possibilities but also the ethical implications offered by artificial  intelligence; (v) techniques for developing emotional scepticism to override our b rain’s  tendency to be less critical of content that provokes an emotional response; and (vi) statistical  numeracy.     Regulation   The First Amendment of the US Constitut ion means that, for all  the discussion in the US about  the impact of fabricated and manipu lated content, there is very little appetite in the US for  any type of regulatory intervention.224  In Europe however, the regulatory wheels have been  turning slowly, and we are starting to see legislation directed at information disorder.  Germany, for insta nce, recently passed the Network Enforcement Law, which concentrates  primarily on hate speech, and introduces a possib le imposition of  fines on the social networks  if they don’t take down hateful or defamatory content within twenty -four hours.  The BBC  World Service survey measuring attitudes to information and the internet of eighteen                                                    220 Susman -Peña, T. and Vogt, Katya ( June 12, 2017) Ukrainians’ self -defense against information war: What we  learned from Learn to Discern, IREX, https://www.irex.org/insight/ukrainians -self-defense -against -information war-what -we-learned -learn -discern   221 http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org/   222 https://www.centerfornewsliteracy.org/   223 https://www.coursera.org/learn/news -literacy   224 Gillespie, T.

  71     countries, showed that only  in two of the eighteen countries, China and the UK, did a majority  want their governments to regulate the internet.225    However, there’s  little denying that t he regulatory discourse in Europe has been loud since  late December 2016, when Giovanni Pitruzzella, the chairman of the Italian Competition  Authority, told the Financial Times  that EU countries should deal with "post -truth" politics by  setting up antitrust -like agencies devoted to spotting and removing fake news.226  And then, in January 2017, Andrus Ansip, the European Commission (EC) Vice President for  the Digital Single Market, warned that if Facebook and other tech companies didn’t take  tougher stances on fake news, the EC might have to step in. Ansip told the Financial Times in  an interview, “I really believe in self -regulatory measures, but if some ki nd of clarifications are  needed then we will be ready for that.”227 However, on Twitter, he stressed228 that he was  not referring to a ‘ministry of truth.’     The European Commission has already pushed Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft to  sign up to a cod e of conduct229 that aims to tackle online hate speech and take down the  majority of potentially illegal content within 24 hours.  Many fear this code of conduct might  become a blueprint for regulating fabricated content online.     In the United Kingdom, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee set up a Fake News Inquiry,  and evidence was submitted230 by 79 experts and organizations. The inquiry was closed when  the election was called, and it is unknown whether it will reconvene.     In the Czech Republic, officials  are monitoring fake news directly. Ahead of the country’s  general election in October, the Czech government has set up a “specialised analytical and  communications unit”231 within the Ministry of the Interior that, as part of its work to monitor  threats to internal security, will also target “ dis-information  campaigns.” According to the  Ministry, it will “not force the ‘truth’ on anyone, or censor media content.” Rather, as the  unit’s Twitter page explains, it will assess whether the dis-information  seriously affects                                                    225 Cellan -Jones, R.

  72     internal security, and, if so, it will respond by publicising available facts and data that disprove  the fake story.     Whatever happens in Europe will set an important global precedent.   Already, Singapore’s  Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam stated that laws to tackle the “scourge of fake  news” are expected to be introduced next year.232     Any attempt to create a regulatory framework will be problematic without appropriate  definitions for information disorder. When politicians or po licymakers talk about ‘fake news’,  what are they targeting? Fabricated news sites created for profit? Twitter raids created by  loose networks of bored US teens on 4Chan? Anti -European broadcasts propagated by Russia  Today ?    As Jan Kleijssen, the Director o f the Information Society and Action against Crime Department  of the Council of Europe reminds us, “When we speak about freedom of expression today, we  often hear a ‘but’ - and then mention is made of ‘hate speech’ and ‘fake news’. At the Council  of Europe , we believe that we have to be very careful with that ‘but’ after freedom of  expression. We are talking about one of the most important foundations of democracy, one  of the most important foundations of democratic security.” The topics of mis -, mal - and d isinformation are too important to start legislating and regulating around until we have a  shared understanding of what we mean by these terms.                                                       232 Yi, S.B. (June 19, 2017) ‘New legislation to combat fake news likely to be introduced next year: Shanmugam’,  Straits Times, http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new -legislation -to-combat -fake-news -next-year-shanmugam  
  73       Figure 1 5: Cartoon by Cathy Wilcox, drawn for UNESCO for World Press Freedom Day 2017.     An easier regulatory move that we are likely to see soon is connected to online advertising on  Facebook. With the news that Russia was buying ‘dark’ posts on Facebook and targeting them  at US citizens in the run up to the 2016 US election, there is a growing pressur e for increased  transparency around these types of advertisements.233 Without any oversight on what is  being published and to whom, there can be no accountability. In most democracies paid -for  election related communication is held to certain standards befor e it can be broadcast or  published. In 2011, the F ederal Communications Commission  ruled that Facebook did not  have to require disclaimers on its paid -for posts, but we expect this to be revisited as the  opportunities presented by this technology, to those  trying to sow dis-information , become  clearer.      While Mark Zuckerberg announced on September 21, 2017 that Facebook will ensure that  anyone advertising on Facebook will have to disclose which page paid for an ad, and will also  ensure that you can visit a n advertiser’s page and see the ads that they are currently running                                                    233 Vaidhyanathan, S.

  74     to any audience on Facebook.  While this seems like a positive step, as a group of  distinguished academics wrote in response to the announcement via an open letter:     Transparency is a first  step in the right direction. Digital political advertising  operates in a dynamic tension between data and humans, commerce and  politics, power and participation. Some of these tensions can be resolved by  transparency, others not. The way forward is to eng age with governments,  regulators, election monitoring bodies, civil society and academics to develop  public policies and guidelines for ensuring fairness, equality, and democratic  oversight in digital political campaigns.234                                                           234 Helberger, N. et al.

  75     Part 4: Future trends   Messaging apps   As discussed, much of the recent debate around mis - and dis -information has focused on  their political impact, and this debate has been largely shaped by events during the US  election. As a result, much of the focus has been on the Facebook News Feed. But even a  cursory glance outside of the US demonstrates that the next frontier for mis - and dis information is closed -messaging apps.235     According to the Digital News Report published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of  Journalism236, the u se of the Facebook -owned WhatsApp as a news source rivals Facebook in  a number of markets, including Malaysia, Brazil and Spain. While WhatsApp is clearly the  most dominant messaging app globally, the popularity of different apps in other countries is  quite startling. For example, WeChat, the most popular messaging app in China, has 963  million users as of Q2 2017.237    The obvious challenge of tackling rumours and fabricated content on these messaging apps is  that it’s impossible to know what is being shared.  There are innovative projects attempting to  tackle rumours being shared on these apps. One example is the Thai News Agenc y’s ‘Sure and  Share ’ project, which encourages audience members to submit questions they have about  content, rumours or stories circul ating on the messaging app LINE. The news agency then  creates engaging infographics or YouTube videos based on their fact -checking and shares  them on their LINE channel. Similar initiatives are emerging for WhatsApp in Colombia238 and  India239.    Augmented real ity, artificial reality and voice recognition     As we continue to undertake research and work collaboratively on solutions, our biggest  challenge will be the speed at which technology is refining the creation of fabricated video  and audio.                                                       235 Dias, N.

  76     Research by Just us Thies and colleagues240 has demonstrated how technologists can change  facial expressions in live video.  And, as Nick Bilton wrote in an article for Vanity Fair , “The  technology out of Stanford that can manipulate a real -time news clip doesn’t need an arr ay of  high -end computers like those used by Pixar; it simply needs a news clip from YouTube and a  standard Webcam on your laptop.”     More recently, researchers at the University of Washington used artificial intelligence to  create visually convincing video s of Barack Obama saying things he had said before, but in a  completely different context.241 The researchers fed a neural network seventeen hours of  footage from the former president’s weekly addresses as ‘training data’. The resulting  algorithm was able to  generate mouth shapes from Obama’s voice and overlay them onto  Obama’s face in a different “target” video.     Audio can be manipulated even more easily than video. Adobe has created Project VoCo,  which has been nicknamed ‘Photoshop for audio’. The product allows users to feed a 10 -to-20  minute clip of of someone’s voice into the application and then dictate words in that person’s  exact voice. Another company called Lyrebird242 is working on voice generation. On its site, it  claims to “need as little as one mi nute of audio recording of a speaker to compute a unique  key defining her/his voice. This key will then generate anything from its corresponding voice.”  It also plans to create an API whereby other platforms could easily use those voices.     Finally, Mark Zu ckerberg at Facebook’s Developer Conference, F8, in April 2017,  demonstrated new Augmented Reality technology that allows users to seamlessly ‘add’  features and filters to their images or videos. Zuckerberg used the example of adding more  steam to the imag e of his morning coffee. While this is a harmless example, the darker  versions of augmented reality are easy to imagine.                                                            240 Thies, J. at al.

  77     Part 5: Conclusions   This report has provided a conceptual framework for thinking about information disorder. We  hope that the definitions explained here will provide a structure for conversations by  policymakers, legislators and researchers who are investigating the phenomeno n. Only by  beginning with a shared understanding can we start constructively discussing solutions. We  also hope that our conceptual framework, which outlines the different elements and phases  of information disorder, will help bring nuance to debates about  this issue.      First, we need to understand communication as something beyond just a transmission of  messages. People’s consumption of news and information is, first and foremost, a way to  reaffirm their affinity with a larger dramatic narrative about the  world and their place in it,  and transcends facts and figures.     Second, if we are serious about creating solutions, we need to consider the specific  motivations of different types of ‘Agents’, the characteristics of different types of ‘Messages’  and the f actors impacting how people ‘Interpret’ those messages. We also need to recognise  how messages and the motivations about them can shift and transform as other agents re produce and disseminate these messages.     We have also outlined research from different disciplines and methodological backgrounds. In  particular, we want to connect the excellent experimental work that has helped us to  understand how people process information with the sociological and cultural theories that  highlight how and why people seek  out information and use it to position themselves within  certain ‘tribes’.     To us, it is clear that any solutions will need to be based on a multi -disciplinary approach.  While some recent psychological research in the US context has highlighted the effect s of  fact-checking initiatives in making people question information, it has also shown that these  initiatives can have little impact on people’s underlying beliefs —as in the case of Donald  Trump’s supporters. We need more research on the influence of emot ions on the way  humans make sense of and use information in their lives.     As D’Ancona underlines, conspiracy theories are effective because they are based on  powerful narratives. They unconsciously tap into deep -seated fears. “Veracity will be  drowned out unless it is resonant.”243 There is research that shows that for false information  to be challenged effectively, our brains need it to be replaced with an alternative narrative244.                                                     243 D’Ancona, (2017), p.131   244 Nyan, B. and J. Reifler (2015) ‘Displacing Mis -information about Events: An Experimental Test of Causal  Corrections’, Journal of Experimental Political Science , 2 (1) : 81 -93 
  78       So to use rumours about Obama’s religious affiliation as an example, rather t han stating  ‘Barack Obama is not a Muslim’ it is more effective to provide a story (preferably with a  powerful narrative structure) of Obama going to his local Christian church with his family.   We need to fight rumours and conspiracy with engaging and pow erful narratives that  leverage the same techniques as dis-information . As discussed in Part 1, effective strategies  for dis-information  include: provoking an emotional response, repetition, a strong visual  aspect and a powerful narrative.  If we remember t he powerful, ritualistic aspects to  information seeking and consumption, the importance of integrating these elements into our  solutions is obvious.     While the explosion of fact -checking and debunking initiatives is admirable, there is an urgent  need to u nderstand the most effective formats for sparking curiosity and skepticism in  audiences about the information they consume and the sour ces from which that information   comes. Simply pushing out more ‘factual information’ into the ecosystem, without sufficie ntly  understanding the emotional and ritualistic elements of communication, is potentially a waste  of time and resources.     We are seeing success with the use of nudge technology to remind people to check the  veracity of information before re -sharing, as we ll as hopeful initiatives such as the  International Center For Journalist’s TruthBuzz competition, which is encouraging people to  design fact -checking and debunking formats that are highly engaging and shareable. We are  also seeing games being created to h elp teach news literacy skills.245 Formats for reporting on  mis-information  do seem matter in terms of connecting with audiences. A recent experiment  found that videos were considered “more interesting and understandable” than a comparable  print -based fact -checking story.246    And as the director of the International Fact -Checking N etwork, Alexios Mantzarlis concludes:  “We need to find formats for people who are bored with reading long articles stuffed with                                                    245 Schmidt, C.

  79     hyperlinks. On this front I am glad to note some success on Snapchat247 and bots248. But we  haven’t seen a breakaway podcast, and se en the struggles with TV.”249     The next area of research and testing should be devoted to understanding the performative  element of why people share mis -, mal - and dis -information. How can that be slowed down?  What cultural factors would make it shameful or  embarrassing? In addition to teaching  emotional scepticism as part of news literacy education programs, how do we teach people  how to call out their friends and family when they post fabricated or misleading content on  social networks or in closed messagi ng apps? Brooke Borel, in a piece titled ‘How to Talk to  Your Facebook Friends about Fake News,’250 provided tips based on academic literature and a  case study of two old high school friends who managed to overcome their political differences  via a long exch ange on Facebook. We need more research, and accessible resources derived  from this research, to help people navigate the challenges of peer -to-peer news literacy.     The technological developments outlined in the previous section demonstrate that, as we run   to catch up with the current phenomenon of polluted information streams, we are going to  have to run faster if we want to be well -placed to deal with these technological  advancements. In a short amount of time, audiences will have little trust in the info rmation  they find online, dismissing any image, video or audio clip as potentially fabricated or  manipulated. The implications of this reality are truly terrifying, particularly as our societies  become increasingly polarized and divided. We must work toget her on solutions driven by  research and experimentation to mitigate dis-information  and significantly improve  information literacy. Knee -jerk reactions based on poor definitional frameworks, or simplistic  calls to limit access to information, will only cre ate more problems in the long run.   Information disorder can not be solved overnight, but the first step is understanding the  complexity of the issue. We hope this report has provided useful framing and context.                                                          247 Mantzarlis, A (Feb. 2, 2016) Fact -checkers experiment with Snapchat, GIFs and other stuff millennials ♥.

  80     Part 6: Recommendations   What could technology companies  do?  1. Create an international advisory council.  We recommend the creation of an  independent, international council, made up of members from a variety of disciplines  that can (1) guide technology companies as they deal with information di sorder and  (2) act as an honest broker between technology companies.   2. Provide researchers with the data related to initiatives aimed at improving the  quality of information. While technology companies are understandably nervous  about sharing their data (whe ther that’s metrics related to how many people see a  fact-check tag, or the number of people who see a ‘disputed content’ flag and then do  not go on to share the content), independent researchers must have better access to  this data in order to properly ad dress information disorder and evaluate their  attempts to enhance the integrity of public communication spaces. As such, platforms  should provide whatever data they can —and certainly more than they are currently  providing.   3. Provide transparent criteria for any algorithmic changes that down -rank content .   Algorithmic tweaks or the introduction of machine learning techniques can lead to  unintended consequences, whereby certain types of content is de -ranked or removed.  There needs to be transparency around thes e changes so the impact can be  independently measured and assessed. Without this transparency, there will be claims  of bias and censorship from different content producers.   4. Work collaboratively. Platforms have worked together to fight terrorism and child  abuse. Slowly, collaboration is also beginning to happen around information disorder,  and we encourage such collaboration, particularly when it involves sharing  information about attempts to amplify content.   5. Highlight contextual details  and build visual ind icators.  We recommend that social  networks and search engines automatically surface contextual information and  metadata that would help users ascertain the truth of a piece of content (for example  automatically showing when a website was registered or runn ing a reverse image  search to see whether an image is old). The blue verification tick is an example of a  helpful visual indicator that exists across platforms. We argue that technology  companies should collaborate to build a consistent set of visual indic ators for these  contextual details. This visual language should be developed in collaboration with  cognitive psychologists to ensure efficacy.   6. Eliminate financial incentives.  Technology companies as well as advertising networks  more generally must devise w ays to prevent purveyors of dis -information from gaining  financially.   7. Crack down on computational amplification.  Take stronger and quicker action against  automated accounts used to boost content.  
  81     8. Adequately moderate non -English content.  Social networks nee d to invest in  technology and staff to monitor mis -, dis- and mal -information in all languages.   9. Pay attention to audio/visual forms of mis - and dis -information.  The problematic  term ‘fake news’ has led to an unwarranted fixation on text -based mis - and dis information. However, our research suggests that fabricated, manipulated or falsely contextualized visuals are more pervasive than textual falsehoods. We also expect  fabricated audio to become an increasing problem. Technology companies must  address these formats as well as text.   10. Provide metadata to trusted partners . The practice of stripping metadata from  images and video, (for example location information, capture date and timestamps),  although protective of privacy and conservative of data, often complic ates verification.  Thus, we recommend that trusted partners be provided increased access to such  metadata.   11. Build fact -checking and verification tools.  We recommend that technology companies  build tools to support the public in fact -checking and verifying rumors and visual  content, especially on mobile phones.   12. Build ‘authenticity engines’.  As audio -visual fabrications become more sophisticated,  we need the search engines to build out ‘authenticity’ engines and water -marking  technologies to provide mechanis ms for original material to be surfaced and trusted.   13. Work on solutions specifically aimed at minimising the impact of filter bubble s:  a) Let users customize feed and search algorithms.  Users should be given the  chance to consciously change the algorithms that populate their social feeds  and search results. For example, they should be able to choose to see diverse  political content or a greater amount of international content in their so cial  feeds.   b) Diversify exposure to different people and views.  Using the existing  algorithmic technology on the social networks that provides suggestions for  pages, accounts, or topics to follow, these should be designed to provide  exposure to different typ es of content and people. There should be a clear  indication that this is being surfaced deliberately, and while the views or  content might be uncomfortable or challenging, it is necessary to have an  awareness of different perspectives.   c) Allow users to cons ume information privately . To minimize performative  influences on information consumption, we recommend that technology  companies provide more options for users to consume content privately,  instead of publicizing everything they ‘like’ or ‘follow.   d) Change the terminology used by the social networks . Three common concepts  of the social platforms unconsciously affect how we avoid different views and  remain in our echo chambers. ‘To follow’, for most people subconsciously  implies a kind of agreement, so it emo tionally creates a resistance against 
  82     exposure to diverse opinion. ‘Friend’ also connotes a type of bond you  wouldn't want to have with those you strongly disagree with but are curious  about. So is the case with ‘like’, when you want to start reading a cer tain  publication on Facebook. We should instead institute neutral labels such as  connecting to someone, subscribing to a publication, bookmarking a story, etc.     What could national governments  do?  1. Commission research to map information disorder . National governments should  commission research studies to examine information disorder within their respective  countries, using the conceptual map provided in this report. What types of  information disorder are most common? Which platforms are the primary vehicles  for  dissemination? What research has been car ried out that examines audience  responses  to this type of content in specific countries? The methodology should be consistent  across these research studies exercises, so that different countries can be accurate ly  compared.   2. Regulate ad networks. While the platforms are taking steps to prevent fabricated  ‘news’ sites from making money, other networks are stepping in to fill the gap. States  should draft regulations to prevent any advertising from appearing on these  sites.    3. Require transparency around Facebook ads.  There is currently no oversight in terms  of who purchases ads on Facebook, what ads they purchase and which users are  targeted. National governments should demand transparency about these ads so that  ad p urchasers and Facebook can be held accountable.   4. Support public service media organisations and local news outlets. The financial  strains placed on news organisations in recent years has led to ‘news deserts’ in  certain areas. If we are serious about reduci ng the impact of information disorder,  supporting quality journalism initiatives at the local, regional and national level needs  to be a priority.   5. Roll out advanced cyber -security training. Many government institutions use bespoke  computer systems that ar e incredibly easy to hack, enabling the theft of data and the  generation of mal-information. Training should be  available at all levels of government  to ensure everyone understands digital security best practices and to prevent  attempts at hacking and phis hing.   6. Enforce minimum levels of public service news on to the platforms . Encourage  platforms to work with independent public media organisations to integrate quality  news and analysis into users’ feeds.     What could media organisations  do?  1. Collaborate . It makes little sense to have journalists at different news organisations  fact-checking the same claims or debunking the same visual content. When it comes  to debunking mis - or dis -information, there should be no ‘scoop’ or ‘exclusive’. Thus, 
  83     we argue th at newsrooms and fact -checking organisations should collaborate to  prevent duplications of effort and free journalists to focus on other investigations.   2. Agree policies on strategic silence . News organisations should work on best practices  for avoiding bei ng manipulated by those who want to amplify mal - or dis -information.   3. Ensure strong ethical standards across all media . News organizations have been  known to sensationalize headlines on Facebook in ways that wouldn’t be  accepted on  their own websites. News  organizations should enforce the same content standards,  irrespective of where their content is placed.   4. Debunk sources as well as content . News organisations are getting better at fact checking and debunking rumours and visual content, but they must also learn to track  the sources behind a piece of content in real time. When content is being pushed out  by bot networks, or loose organised groups of people with an agenda, news  organisations should identifying this as quickly as possible.  This will require j ournalists  to have computer programming expertise.   5. Produce more segments and features  about critical information consumption . The  news media should produce more segments and features which teach audiences how  to be critical of content they consume. When th ey write debunks, they should explain  to the audience how the process of verification was undertaken.   6. Tell stories about the scale and threat posed by information disorder .  News and  media organisations have a responsibility to educate audiences about the  scale of  information pollution worldwide, and the implications society faces because of it, in  terms of undermining trust in institutions, threatening democratic principles,  inflaming divisions based on nationalism, religion, ethnicity, race, class, sexua lity or  gender.   7. Focus on improving the quality of headlines . User behaviour shows  the patterns  by  which people skim headlines via social networks without clicking through to the whole  article. It therefore places greater responsibility on news outlets to write headlines  with care.  Research251 using natural language processing techniques are starting to  automatically assess whether headlines are overstating the evidence available in the  text of the article. This might prevent some of the more irresponsible h eadlines from  appearing.   8. Don’t disseminate fabricated content . News organisations need to improve standards  around publishing and broadcasting information and content sourced from the social  web. There is also a responsibility to ensure appropriate use of headlines, visuals,  captions and statistics in news output. Clickbait headlines, the misleading use of  statistics, unattributed quotes are all adding to the polluted information ecosystem.                                                         251 Chesney, S., M. Liakata, M. Poesio and M. Purver (2017) Incongruent Headlines: Yet Another Way to  Mislead Your Readers, http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~mpurver/papers/chesney -et-al17nlpj.pdf  
  84     What could civil society do?   1. Educate the public about the threat of information disorder . There is a need to  educate people about the persuasive techniques that are used by those spreading dis and mal -information, as well as a need to educate people about the risks of  information disorder to society, i.e., sowing distru st in official sources and dividing  political parties, religions, races and classes.   2. Act as honest brokers. Non-profits and independent groups can act as honest brokers,  bringing together different players in the fight against information disorder, includi ng  technology companies, newsrooms, research institutes, policy -makers, politicians and  governments.     What could education ministries  do?   1. Work internationally to create a standardized news literacy curriculum.  Such a  curriculum should be for all ages, based on best practices, and focus on adaptable  research skills, critical assessment of information sources, the influence of emotion on  critical thinking and the inner workings and implications of algorithms and artificial  intelligence.   2. Work with libraries.  Libraries are one of the few institutions where trust has not  declined, and for people no longer in full time education, they are a critical resource  for teaching the skills required for navigating the digital  ecosystem. We must ensure  communities can access both online and offline news and digital literacy materials via  their local libraries.   3. Update journalism school curricula . Ensure journalism schools teach computational  monitoring and forensic verification techniques for finding and authenticating content  circulating on the social web, as well as best practices for reporting on information  disorder.     What could Grant -Making Foundations  do?  1. Provide support for testing solutions . In this rush for solutions, it  is tempting to  support initiatives that ‘seem’ appropriate. We need to ensure there is sufficient  money to support the testing of any solutions. For example, with news literacy  projects, we need to ensure money is being spent to assess what types of mater ials  and teaching methodology are having the most impact. It is vital that academics are  connecting with practitioners working in many different industries as solutions are  designed and tested. Rather than small grants to multiple stakeholders, we need  fewer, bigger grants for ambitious multi -partner, international research groups and  initiatives.   2. Support technological solutions.  While the technology companies should be required  to build out a number of solutions themselves, providing funding for smaller s tartups  to design, test and innovate in this space is crucial. Many solutions need to be rolled 
  85     out across the social platforms and search engines. These should not be developed as  proprietary technology.   3. Support programs teaching people critical research and information skills.  We must  provide financial support for journalistic initiatives which attempt to help audiences  navigate their information ecosystems, such as public -service media, local news media  and educators teaching fact -checking and verification skills.   
  86     Appendix: European Fact -checking and Debunking  Initiatives   According to a study published in 2016 by Lucas Graves and Federica Cherubini,  there are 34  permanent fact checking operations that exist across 20 European countries. There are two  different types: those attached to news organisations (around 40%) and those that operate as  nonprofits (around 60%).252   Much of the following information is drawn from the fact-checking dat abase  created by Duke  University’s Reporter’s Lab.

The Council of Europe is the continent’s leading human  rights organisation. It comprises 47 member states, 28 of which are members of the European Union. All Council of Europe member states have signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, a treaty designed to protect human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The European Court of Human Rights oversees the implementation of the Convention in the member states.ENG PREMS 162317 www.coe.intThis report provides a new framework for policy-makers,  legislators, researchers, technologists and practitioners working on the theoretical and practical challenges related to mis-, dis- and mal-information — the three elements of  information disorder. While the historical impact of rumours  and fabricated content have been well documented, the complexity and scale of information pollution in our digitally-connected, increasingly polarised world presents an unprecedented challenge. There is an immediate need to work collaboratively on workable solutions and this report  provides a framework for the different stakeholders involved  in research, policy discussions, and technical innovations connected to this phenomenon of information disorder. www.coe.int/freedomofexpression This report has been commissioned by the Council of Europe and produced in co-operation with First Draft and the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.
