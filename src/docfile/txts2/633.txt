 5  Preface Rathenau Instituut   Smart devices surveilling our lives. Artificial intelligence technologies steering our behaviour. Care robots   hindering human contact. Does this sound terrifying? Inevitable? It does not have to be. Time for a wake up call.     The Rathenau Instituut was established more than thirty years ago. Its mission: to research the societal  impact of new technologies and deve lopments in science. Since then, our research has illustrated the  notion of this convergence: the growing interaction between nanotechnology, biotechnology, information  technology and cognitive technology. This report elaborates on NBIC convergence, with a  special focus  on the connection between human rights and technological convergence, in particular technologies  concerning robotics, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented reality.     The report demonstrates that these technologies can have a pos itive or a negative impact on human  rights. Regarding these rights, we focus on issues relating to the right to respect private life, human  dignity, ownership, safety and liability, freedom of expression and the prohibition of discrimination as well  as acc ess to justice and the right to a fair trial.     The Rathenau Instituut conducted this research on the invitation of the Committee on Culture, Science,  Education and Media of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). Our research  shows tha t the human rights framework form s a practical starting point for policy makers tasked with  regulating robotics, artificial intelligence or similar technologies. However, in certain cases clarification on  the rights is needed. We therefore argue in favour of two, novel, human rights: the right to not be  measured, analysed or coached, and the right to meaningful human contact.     I would like to thank PACE, and Mr. Le Déaut in particular, for the invitation, enabling us to further  elaborate on our body of work  in order to explore emerging technologies and the challenges that arise  from a human rights perspective. We hope that our report provides inspiration in future discussions.     The technologies described in this report can be of great benefit to us all. Howe ver, in order to maintain  our human dignity and fundamental rights, we have to remain vigilant, remembering our values as laid  down in the conventions and apply these in practice. Fortunately, robots or AI do not determ ine the rules,  but society does . It is possible, if needed, to draft policies before technologies take over. The legislators  of the Oviedo Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine recognised this  earlier . We therefore trust  that our wake -up call will be carried on by the Council of Europe  to also protect our human dignity in the  digital age .

 6  Preface Committee on Culture,  Science, Education and Media of the  Parliamentary Assembly of the  Council of Europe (PACE)   Science and technology are having a n increasing impact on society. The new challenges of the digital  age, synthetic biology, artificial intelligence and genome editing are leading to accelerated changes as  their applications enter the market, but the understanding of them is incomplete.     These technological fields combine nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive  technology (NBIC). They represent very powerful developments, often characterised by their irreversible  and uncertain nature.     The boundaries between the medical and the non -medical and the non -living and the living are fading.  We have moved on from a human being that is taken care of well to a healed person, and what is  looming on the horizon now is an enhanced human being.     The Rathenau Instituut has writ ten a high -quality report which analyses these new technological  advancements against the background of bioethical principles.     The protection of personal data, the fair and lawful processing of big data and the Internet of Things all  create challenges for  the legislator, because there is no real transparency in relation to algorithms. The  right to respect for private life is a concern too, since various IT applications aim to change people’s  attitudes or behaviour. Such persuasive activities may undermine people’s autonomy and self determination, and also their freedom of thought and conscience.     So-called electronic coaches allow a form of voluntary self -monitoring, but in reality the recorded data  create digital representations of the self in an opaque ma nner.     Care robots have been equipped with artificial intelligence, but they could influence the quality of human  relationships by keeping the individual in a virtual world.     This report analyses the safety of robots and artificial intelligence artefacts a nd the respective  responsibilities of the designer, the operator and the user, as well as the consequences for human  dignity, freedom of expression, ownership, the security of robots and artificial intelligence artefacts,  discrimination and access to justi ce.    It is on the basis of this thorough and relevant analysis that I propose as rapporteur for the Parliamentary  Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE):   – to strengthen the legislation of the public authorities and equip individuals with legal means to re sist  pressures or constraints that would subject them to technologies which would enhance their  performances,   – to ensure transparency and raise public awareness,   – to define the responsibilities of the actors involved in automatic processing aimed at the coll ection,  use and treatment of personal data,  
 7  – to create a common normative framework for artificial intelligence artefacts,   – to require that any machine, robot or artificial intelligence artefact remains under human control,   – to establish a right to be let alo ne, that is to say a right to refuse to be subjected to profiling, to have  one’s location tracked or to be manipulated, and the right to meaningful human contact,   – to establish cooperation between the Council of Europe, the European Union and UNESCO to  deve lop a harmonised legal framework and regulatory mechanisms at the international level.     Innovation is desirable if it provides a service to society. Progress is useful if it is controlled and shared.   This report by the Rathenau Instituut and my parliament ary report that includes the recommendations of  the Council of Europe both agree that we are working towards achieving a fine balance between artificial  intelligence and human rights.

 9  1 Introduction   Background   As the continent’s leading human rights organi sation, the Council of Europe  has a long -standing history  of anticipating and coping with the downsides of new technologies in the face of human rights and  human dignity. For example, triggered by developments in the field of biotechnology, the Parliamentary  Assembly advised the Counc il of Europe in 1991 to start preparing for a convention on bioethics. In  1997, this led to the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (Oviedo Convention). The  purpose of this Oviedo Convention is laid down in article 1: ‘Parties to this Conve ntion shall protect the  dignity and identity of all human beings and guarantee everyone, without discrimination, respect for their  integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of biology and  medicine. ’ Furthermore, art icle 2 of the Oviedo Convention clearly instructs that ‘the interests and welfare  of the human being shall prevail over the sole interest of society or science ’.    Recently, there has been a  growing awareness within the Council of Europe that a new wave of  emerging technologies, enabled by technological convergence and including big data, robotics and  artificial intelligence (AI), is raising all kinds of ethical and social issues that may be highly challenging in  the light of current ethical frameworks and r egulatory regimes. Prompted by this , the Committee on  Bioethics of the Council of Europe (DH -BIO) in May 2015 organi sed The International Conference on  Emerging Technologies and Human Rights.1 DH-BIO concluded that ‘there is a clear need to look into  these  new developments in order to be able to respond to the possible ethical and legal challenges  raised by these new technologies and their convergence ’. This challenge was picked up by the  Committee on Culture, Science, Education and Media of the Parliamenta ry Assembly of the Council of  Europe (PACE). In June 2015, a motion was tabled that ple aded for ‘a forward -looking debate by the  Parliamentary Assembly ’.2 In September 2015 , Mr. Le Déaut was appointed as rapporteur in order to  write a report on ‘Technologi cal convergence, artificial intelligence and human rights ’. This exercise is  driven by the notion that it might be wise to apply some of the basic guiding principles of the Oviedo  Convention – such as  the protection of private life, respect for autonomy, the right to information and  informed consent – beyond the biomedical field. Its aim is that the Council of Europe will come up with  proposals for the governance of converging technologies in order to safeguard human rights, such as the  right to  bodily inte grity, privacy and freedom of thought.  In order to complete  this report, PACE has  looked for cooperation with various knowledge partners. It asked the Rathenau Instituut to write a  concise , background expert report on the above -mentioned  topic.  The c urrent  paper is the result of that  request.     On 22 March 2017 , the Committee on Culture, Science, Education and Media  discussed the draft  recommendations made by  the rapporteur . The draft recommendation s were adopted unanimously.3 On  28 April 2017 , the Parliame ntary Assembly  unanimously adopted an amended version of the  recommendation4 based on the rapporteur’s report.5 See Box 1.1 for the full text of the recommendation  from the Parliamentary Assembly .      1 Council of Europe, ‘Emerging technologies’, http://www.coe.int/en/web/bioethics/emerging -technologies .  2 Council of Europe – Parliamentary Assembly, ‘Technological convergence, artificial intelligence and human rights’, 24 June 2015,  http://www.assem bly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H -Xref-ViewPDF.asp?FileID=21951&lang=en .   3 Council of Europe – Parliamentary Assembly, ‘Intelligent artefacts should not challenge different dimensions of human rights’, 22 March 2017,  http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News -View -EN.asp?newsid=6556 .

 10    Box 1.1 Overview of Recommendation a dopted by PACE on 28 April 2017   Recommendation 2102 (2017) Provisional version   Technological convergence, artificial intelligence and human rights   1. The convergence between nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive  sciences and the speed at which the applications of new technologies are put on the market have  consequences not only for human rights and the way they can be exercised, but also for the  fundamental concept of what characterises a human being.   2. The pervasiveness of new tech nologies and their applications is blurring the boundaries between  human and machine, between online and offline activities, between the physical and the virtual  world, between the natural and the artificial, and between reality and virtuality. Humankind i s  increasing its abilities by boosting them with the help of machines, robots and software. Today it is  possible to create functional brain -computer interfaces. A shift has been made from the “treated”  human being to the “repaired” human being, and what is  now looming on the horizon is the  “augmented” human being.   3. The Parliamentary Assembly notes with concern that it is increasingly difficult for lawmakers to  adapt to the speed at which science and technologies evolve and to draw up the required  regulations  and standards; it strongly believes that safeguarding human dignity in the 21st century  implies developing new forms of governance, new forms of open, informed and adversarial public  debate, new legislative mechanisms and above all the establishment of in ternational co -operation  making it possible to address these new challenges most effectively.   4. The Assembly recalls the principle enshrined in Article 2 of the Convention on Human Rights and  Biomedicine (ETS No. 164, “Oviedo Convention”) which affirms the p rimacy of the human being by  stating that “the interests and welfare of the human being shall prevail over the sole interest of  society or science”.   5. In this regard, the Assembly welcomes the initiative of the Council of Europe Committee on  Bioethics to org anise, in October 2017 on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Council of  Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, an international conference to discuss the  prospect of the emergence of these new technologies and their consequences for hu man rights,  with a view to developing a strategic action plan during the next biennium 2018 -19.  6. In addition, the Assembly considers that it is necessary to implement genuine world internet  governance that is not dependent on private interest groups or just  a handful of States.   7. The Assembly calls on the Committee of Ministers to:   7.1 finalise without further delay the modernisation of the Convention for the Protection of  Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS No. 108) in order to  have new provisions making it possible to put rapidly in place more appropriate protection;   7.2 define the framework for the use of care robots and assistive technologies in the Council of  Europe Disability Strategy 2017 -2023 in the framework of its objective t o achieve equality,  dignity and equal opportunities for people with disabilities.   8. In the light of the above, the Assembly urges the Committee of Ministers to instruct the relevant  bodies of the Council of Europe to consider how intelligent artefacts and/or  connected devices and,  more generally, technological convergence and its social and ethical consequences related to the  field of genetics and genomics, neurosciences and big data, challenge the different dimensions of    5 Council of Europe – Parliamentary Assembly, 'Intelligent artefacts should not challenge different dimensions of human rights', 28 April 2017,  https://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News -View -EN.asp?newsid=6624&cat=8 .  
 11  human rights.   9. Moreover, the Assembly proposes that guidelines be drawn up on the following issues:   9.1 strengthening transparency, regulation by public authorities and operators’ accountability  concerning:   9.1.1  the fact that responsibility and accountability lies with the human being, no matter the  circumstances. References to “independent” decision making by artificial intelligence  systems cannot exempt the creators, owners and managers of these systems from  accountability for human rights violations committed with the use of these systems,  even in ca ses where the action that caused the damage was not directly ordered by a  responsible human commander or operator;   9.1.2  automatic processing operations aimed at collecting, handling and using personal data;   9.1.3  informing the public about the value of the data they generate, consent to the use of  those data and the length of time they are to be stored;   9.1.4  informing everyone about the processing of personal data which have originated from  them and about the mathematical and statistical methods making profiling possible;   9.1.5  the design and use of persuasion software and of information and communication  technology (ICT) or artificial intelligence algorithms, that must fully respect the dignity  and rights of all users and especially the most vulnerable, such as elderly people an d  people with disabilities;   9.2 a common framework of standards to be complied with when a court uses artificial intelligence;   9.3 the need for any machine, any robot or any artificial intelligence artefact to remain under human  control; insofar as the machine in question is intelligent solely through its software, any power it  is given must be able to be withdrawn from it;   9.4 the recognition of new rights in terms of respect for private and family life, the ability to refuse to  be subjected to profiling, to have one’ s location tracked, to be manipulated or influenced by a  “coach” and the right to have the opportunity, in the context of care and assistance provided to  elderly people and people with disabilities, to choose to have human contact rather than a  robot.   10. The Assembly reiterates its call made in Resolution 2051 (2015) “Drones and targeted killings: the  need to uphold human rights and international law” on all member States and observer States, as  well as States whose parliaments have observer status with the As sembly, to refrain from any  automated (robotic) procedures for selecting individuals for targeted killings or any sort of injury  based on communication patterns or other data collected through mass surveillance techniques.  This should be true not only for drones but also for other combat equipment with artificial  intelligence systems, as well as other equipment and/or software which might potentially inflict  damage on people, property, personal data or information databases, or interfere with privacy,  freed om of expression, or the right to equality and non -discrimination.   11. The Assembly calls for close co -operation with the institutions of the European Union and the  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to ensure a consisten t  legal framework and effective supervisory mechanisms at international level.   Structure of the report   The invitation from PACE to the Rathenau Instituut was probably made because of  earlier work done by  the Rathenau Instituut that explor ed the societal m eaning of so -called NBIC convergence , that is, the  growing interaction between nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive  technology (cf. Berloznik et al. 2006; Van Est & Stemerding 2012; Van Est 2014; Van Est et al. 2014 ;  Kool et al. 2015 ; Royakkers & Van Est 2016 ; Van Est et al. 2016). This report will elaborate on this body 
 12  of work, with a special focus on the connection between human rights and technological convergence, on  particular trends in robotics, AI , and virtual and augm ented reality.     In chapter 2 we introduce the notion of NBIC convergence. We explain  how technological convergence  enables two engineering megatrends: ‘biology is more and more becoming technology’ and ‘technology  is increasingly becoming more biology’ (Ar thur 2009). Because of these trends we are now experienc ing  the historic tipping point at which the distance between technology and ourselves is rapidly decreas ing.  We have become very intimate with technology ; in other words we have become human –machine  mixtures, that is, cyborgs. Historically, the relationship between human rights and the ‘human biology is  becoming technology’ trend has received considerable attention from a human rights perspective ; see,  for example , the Oviedo Convention. In contrast, t he link between human rights and the ‘technology is  becoming biology’ trend has received very little attention so far. To address that blind spot , this report  focuses on that trend.     In chapter 3 we look at the ‘technology is becoming biology’ trend from a human rights perspective. To  make that connection , in our research  we looked at six specific technologies: self -driving cars, care  robots, e -coaches, AI that is used for social sorting, judicial applications of AI , and virtual and augmented  reality. For each of these cases we map the various social, legal and ethical issues that are already in  play or might come into play and relate them to established human rights, for example the rights as set  down in the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights an d Fundamental Freedoms, also known as  the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).6 We illustrate how the se six technologies might  strengthen or challenge certain human rights. This has been organi sed as follows. After the introduction  in section 3.1, w e describe rights related to privacy in section 3.2, which includes the right to the  protection of personal data, the right to respect for private life and the right to respect for family life. The  next section describes how human dignity may be affected, especially in relation to the use of care  robots. We then describe how ownership issues affect the notion of the right to property. Section 3.5  deals with  safety, responsibility and liability (tort rights). The next three sections are dedicated to  how  automated decisions may affect freedom of expression, the prohibition of discrimination, access to justice  and the right to a fair trial (sections 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8). The last section (3.9) proposes two ‘novel’ human  rights: the right to not be measured , analys ed or coached and the right to meaningful human contact.      In chapter 4 we reach our conclusions and set out a list of recommendations which the Council of Europe  could take into account.     Note on our methodology   The source material of international organi sations – such as the Council of Europe and the European  Commission – has been used as the primary source for the report’s background investigation. Owing to  the broad nature of the ‘technology is becoming biology’ trend that is  part of NBIC convergence, t he  scope of this investigation has been limited to the above -mentioned technologies (self -driving cars, care  robots, e -coaches, AI , and virtual and augmented reality). This approach shows the very diverse set of  human rights implications of these technolog ies. However, this report neither provides a complete set of  emerging technologies that are  part of NBIC convergence nor an exhaustive list of possible human rights  challenges. The research was conducted in the period July 2016 to April 2017. The terminolo gy used in  this report builds on the body of work from the Rathenau Instituut.         6 The ECHR is available at: http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf .

 13  This report pa ys special attention to the report  entitled  ‘Civil Law rules on Robotics’ of the Committee on  Legal Affairs (JURI  Committee ) of the European Parliament, chaired b y MEP Mady Delvaux.7 The JURI  Committee adopted its report, which included recommendations for the Commission, in  January 2017 as  part of a motion for a resolution. It calls on the Commission to propose legislation regarding smart robots.  It also suggests a system of registration of advanced robots , to be managed by an EU Agency for  Robotics and AI. The report also provides suggestions on  how to deal with liability for damage caused by  robots. As an annex to the resolution , the report contains a  Code of Eth ical Conduct for Robotics  Engineers (which contains ethical principles for robotics engineering) and a Code for Research Ethics  Com mittees.     With regard to the notion of human rights, the authors stayed as close as possible to the rights and  freedoms as la id down in the ECHR and – when data qualify as personal data – Convention 108  and its  Protocol .8 Where appropriate the report refers to EU legislation, most notably the Charter of Fundament al  Rights of the European Union, the General Data Protection Regula tion and the e -Privacy Directive (to be  repealed by the e -Privacy Regulation) .      7 European Parliament News, ‘Robots and artificial intelligence: MEPs call for EU -wide liability rules’, 16 February 2017,  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news -room/20170210IPR61808/robots -and-artificial -intelligence -meps -call-for-eu-wide -liability -rules .   8 The Convention for the Protection of Indiv iduals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) and its Additional Protocol  regarding supervisory authorities and transborder data flows are available at: https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full -list/-/conventions/treaty/108 . 
 14  2 Converging technologies  converging with humans   Technology becoming biology and vice versa   Technological innovation often results from combining different technologies, so -called  technological  convergence. Currently, such convergence is taking place on a massive scale, since four technological  revolutions are propelling each other, being the nano -, bio-, information and cognitive technologies. This  dynamic quartet is known as NBIC  convergence. NBIC convergence signifies an increasing interaction  between the life sciences, which have traditionally studied living organisms, and the natural or  engineering sciences, which have traditionally studied and buil t non-living systems. This me rger is  reflected in two bioengineering megatrends: ‘biology is becoming technology’ and ‘technology is  becoming biology’ (Arthur 2009 ; Van Est & Stemerding 2012 ).    The first trend implies the promise that in the future living systems, such as  genes, cells , organs and  brains, might be engineered in much the same way as non -living systems, such as bridges and  electronic devices. This expectation is driven by the fact that the engineering sciences provide more and  more ways to measure, analyse  and intervene i n living organisms. Genetically modified bulls, cloned  sheep and dogs, cultured heart valves, bacteria with complete synthetic genomes, human germline  editing, deep brain stimulation and persuasive technologies illustrate this trend. The trend of ‘technolo gy  becoming biology’ refers to the ambition of engineer ing properties we associate with living organisms,  such as self -assembly, self -healing, reproduction, intelligent behavio ur and autonomy into man -made  technology. This trend thus embodies a (future) in crease in artefacts that are inspired by biological,  cognitive and sociocultural systems. Examples of bio -inspired artefacts are engineered stem cells and  3D-printed artificial blood vessels. Humanoid or android robots, avatars and AI are examples of cogno -  and socio -inspired artefacts.     Technology in and close to us, between us, about us and just like us   When we look at our own techno -human condition, the two engineering megatrends support the notion  that humans are becoming more and more intimate with tec hnology  (Van Est 2014) . We let technology  nestle itself within us, close to us and between us. And as a result, this technology can be used to collect  a huge amount  of data about us and mimic facets of our human characteristics.     First, technology is nestl ing itself within us or very close to us. Besides biological techniques, such as   pharmaceutical pills or gene therapy, numerous IT -based interventions are also emerging, such as  RFID  chips, electronic pills, cochlear implants, artificial balance organs and  artificial retina. Technology can  thus become part of our body and sometimes even our brains, and therefore our identity. Technology  also comes between us, on a large scale. Think of smart phones, activity trackers, social media,  massively multiplayer onl ine games and augmented reality glasses. These digital machines penetrate  our private and social life and increasingly influence how humans interact.     Because we accept that these machines nestle themselves within us, close to us and between us, they  can b e used to collect a lot of information about us. Through our interactions with the machines that  surround us – such as  cameras, GPS, smart shoes, DNA chips, face -recognition technologies, Internet  search engines  and smart cars – we are being digitally meas ured. Think about digital data on our genetic  make -up, health, thoughts, feelings, preferences, conversations and whereabouts. These data are not  gathered without a purpose, but are often used to profile human beings in all kinds of ways with the  explicit goal of interven ing in human processes. These three steps in the digiti sation of human life – 
 15  measuring, profiling and intervening – link directly to the three general processes that make up the value  chain of big data: collection, analysis and application  (cf. Roosendaal et al. 2014). The three processes  together create a cybernetic feedback loop .    Finally, some technologies get more and more human -like features. Machines can have  human traits and  we can be touched by their outward appearance, and how they  mimic human activities, such as  driving a  car, exhibit intelligent behavio ur or even show emotions. Think , for example, of self -driving cars, social  robots, digital assistants, chatbots, Google Translate and IBM Watson Health , this last functioning  like a   clinical decision support system for use by medical professionals. It is important to note that the ability of  these machines to mimic human features or activities is often enabled by the fact that a lot of digital data  exists about th ese human activities . Google uses the digiti sed data of human translation, for example  data generated by human translators within the European Parliament, to train its algorithms. Thus ,  gathering a lot of digital data about us enables engineers to create artefacts that behave  just like us, and  this can therefore  even increas e the interacti on between humans and machines.     We may conclude that in this digital age we are experiencing an ongoing merger between humans and  machines. To put it more bluntly, we have become techno -huma ns, mixtures of human s and machine s,  that is, cyborgs. In this report we want to study this intimate interaction between technology and humans  from a human rights perspective.     Studying the merger between human s and machine s  So far , the bulk of the bioethi cal debate and related human rights treaties has focused on invasive  biomedical technologies that work inside the body, or ‘technologies within us’ . It has been commonly  recogni sed that there is a strong connection between biomedical technologies and human  rights. The  Oviedo Convention is shaped around this premise, and created common guiding principles – such as the   protection of private life, respect for autonomy, the right to information and informed consent – to  preserve human dignity in the way humans apply innovations in biomedicine. Above it was outlined that  in the meanwhile there exists  a broad range of technologies that work outside the body but still impact  the bodily, mental and social performance of human beings. Like biomedical technologies, th ese new ,  emerging ICT -based technologies also raise all kinds of ethical, social and human rights issues (cf. Stahl  et al. 2016). Safeguarding human dignity in the 21st century, therefore, forces us to look at all kinds of  intimate technologies, that is, t echnologies inside us ( such as  deep brain stimulation), but also  technologies close to us ( such as  EEG neuromodulation)  and between us ( such as  social media),  technologies that gather  a lot of information about us (big data) and technologies that behave ju st like us  (for example robots and smart environments). This report aims to address the relationship between a  broad range of intimate technologies and human rights. Since the link between intimate technologies  within us and human rights has been widely st udied, debated and regulated, this report focuses on  human rights issues related to non -invasive intimate technologies: technology close to us, between us,  about us and just like us.     To indicate this cluster of technologies , the term the Internet of Thing s (IoT) is often  used. The Internet  has penetrated the whole of society since it has become available in ever more places, especially  through the smartphone. Modern robotics is based on these existing networks and consequently  changes the nature of these n etworks. Through robotics the Internet is given ‘senses ’ by means of  sensors, and ‘hand s and feet ’ by means of actuators. In this manner , an Internet of Robotic Things is  being shaped. A broad set of emerging ICTs, such as  sensor networks, the Internet, bi g data, AI and  robotics, is playing a role in this development. The pervasiveness of these ICTs is ever  increasing and  leads to a blurring of the distinctions between human s and machine s, between our online and offline  activities, between the physical and the virtual world and between reality and virtual or augmented reality  (cf. Floridi 2015). To indicate this human condition, the term onlife  has been used (ibid.).    
 16  In this onlife  world we interact with all sorts of intelligent or digitally coded artefact s. We name four  characteristics of these intelligent artefacts to illustrate the many ways in which we interact with them.  The first characteristic concerns the environments that artefacts inhabit. Some intelligent artefacts can  only thrive in a digital en vironment. These intelligent artefacts are called software agents or softbots.  Intelligent artefacts that can thrive in the physical world are physical robots. Physical robots can be seen  as physically embodied AI. Secondly, intelligent artefacts can have a certain degree of autonomy. When  a human is in control of what the machine does, the hu man is s aid to be ‘in the loop’. When  a human is  in the loop, the location of the operator and the machine may be different. This makes it possible for  people to act r emotely. When the machine acts autonomously, the hu man is said to be ‘out of the loop’.  When the hu man and machine are both partly in control, the hu man is said to be ‘on the loop’. Thirdly,  the interaction between humans and these intelligent artefact s is also shaped by their appearance. If the  soft or physical robots look like machines , one speaks of mechanoids. Animal -like and human -like robots  are called humanoids. Humanoid robots that are built to aesthetically resemble humans are called  androids. Fina lly, the way we perceive the world can be mediated in various ways by intelligent artefact s  – think of virtual or augmented reality.     Each type of interaction between humans and intelligent artefact s can raise various human rights issues.  This report cann ot provide a complete picture. We investigate six specific technologies: self -driving cars,  care robots, e -coaches, artificial intelligence (AI) that is used for social sorting, judicial applications of AI ,  and virtual and augmented reality. The selection of these six cases has been guided by the four  characteristics of intelligent artefacts that are described above. As a result we expect that our study will  provide a sufficiently broad overview of the human rights issues that relate to converging technolog ies, in  particular robotics and AI.    
 17  3 Human rights related to intelligent  artefact s  3.1 Introduction   This chapter examines how six different types of intelligent artefacts – self-driving cars, care robots, e coaches, AI that is used for social sorting, judicial  applications of AI , and virtual and augmented reality –  may strengthen, challenge or infringe our human rights. With respect to the impact of technology on  human rights, we adhere to Kranzberg’s adag e: ‘Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutra l’  (Kranzberg 1986). This implies that technology can have a diverse set of social and ethical  consequences, but that we should be aware of the fact that these impact s can vary significantly   according to how and the contexts within which the technology is used. Because the design of  technology plays an important role in how  technology impacts human lives and fundamental rights,  design choice is a recurring theme within this chapter.     Intelligent artefacts may challenge different dimensions of human rights, for example in terms of  freedoms (privacy and data protection, ownership, autonomy, personality), equality ( more specifically ,  non-discrimination) and justice (fair trial, access to justice). Regarding human rights, we primarily refer to  the principles lai d down in the treaties, charters and documents of the Council of Europe or, where  appropriate, the principles as set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Thus,  the impact of intelligent artefacts is first discussed in the context  of seven existing human rights: the right  to respect for private and family life (3.2), the right to human dignity (3.3), the right to the peaceful  enjoyment of possessions (3.4), tort rights and safety (3.5), the right to freedom of expression as well as   the freedom of thought, conscience and religion (3.6), the prohibition of discrimination (3.7) and access  to justice as well as the right to a fair trial (3.8).     In addition, section 3.9 elaborates on two potential ‘novel’ rights: 1) the right to not be measured ,  analysed  or e-coached, and 2) the right to meaningful human contact. These two novel rights are  indirectly related to, and aim to elaborate on , existing human rights, such as,  respectively, the classic  privacy right to be let alone9 and the right  to respect for family life. These rights might be needed to  protect humans ’ interests in a society where not only have ‘machines’ been put in to humans – which is  (in part) covered by the Oviedo Convention – but also where humans are becoming more and more  part  of ‘machines’, that is, the Internet of Robotic Things.     The preceding  chapter introduced the value chain of big data, which consists of collection, analysis and  application of data. This chapter will reflect on how different types of value chains ch allenge different  human rights. The Internet has prove d itself to be  a powerful tool for collect ing, analy sing and apply ing  data. The Internet has also enabled the arrival of surveillance capitalism , which is characteri sed by  massive data collection and an alysis, psychological experimentation and personali sed persuasion  (Zuboff 2015). We are now witnessing the rise of the Internet of Robotic Things, which , as explained in  chapter 2 , gives the Internet ‘senses ’ and ‘hand and feet ’, and thus provides, compare d to the Internet,  numerous new ways to gather data and intervene in our daily lives. With regard to the Internet , the  actions are initiated by software bots – or softbots – and with regard to the Internet of Robot ic Things      9 As advocated by Warren and Brandeis (1890). These authors created this concept that aims to protect an individual’s sphere of  confidentiality against  public or p rivate interferences.  
 18  these are robots with a physical  appearance ranging from a utensil to an almost human -like robot. To a  certain extent , human rights issues that have been identified and that relate to the virtual world of the  Internet also apply to the mixed virtual and physical world of the Internet of Things. However, in certain  cases, emerging robot technologies impact human rights in a different manner. This chapter aims to  clarify these similarities and distinctions between the Internet and softbots and the Internet of Things and  physical robots.     3.2 The right to respect for privacy   The right to respect for privacy   Never in our history has there been so m uch data collected about so many individuals, stored in so many  places and analysed and used. Strand and Kaiser (2015, 13) argue that there is ‘consider able  uncertainty about how this development may affect the right to privacy as a basic element in the human  condition for personality development ’. In fact, they comment that this uncertainty in itself is a major  concern. This section explores to what exte nt physical robots or softbots challenge the right to respect for  privacy by looking at various application contexts.     When referring to ‘the right to the respect for privacy ’, we refer to the right to the protection of personal  data as explicitly mention ed in article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  and as laid down in Convention 108  as well as to the right to respect for private life as laid down in article  7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  and ar ticle 8 ECHR .10     We first investigate how the protection of personal data is challenged by softbots that operate via the  Internet, mostly via the World Wide Web, and how the right to personal data protection is impacted by   physical  robots, as part of the I nternet of Robotic Things. We then focus on how , respectively , softbots  and physical robots  might affect the right to respect for private life, both in the virtual (Internet) world and  in the physical environment. Lastly, we describe how physical robots may interfere with the right to  establish and develop relationships with other human beings.     3.2.1  Protection of personal data   Protection of personal data and regulations   The primary business model of the Internet is built on mass surveillance (Schneier 2013). For instance,  Facebook processes data about its 1.86 billion members who are active each month ,11 and sometimes  about people who are not a  member of th is social media website (Roosendaal 2012 ; Van Alsenoy et al.  2015 ).12 Kosinski et al. (2013) claim that the surfing behavio ur of Facebook users (for example the ir  number of ‘likes’)  may reveal  a lot of  sensitive personal information about  these users’  lives, such as their  age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality trait s, level of      10 See also, with regard to the right to privacy, article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights. Because of the scope of this report, the human rights  impact of the investigated technologies have not been tested against these  provisions.   11 CNN tech, ‘Facebook is closing in on 2 billion users’, 1 February 2017, https://money.cnn.com/2017/02/01/technology/facebook -earnings/.   12 Currently, the Belgian Data Protection Authority is involved in legal proceedings on the merits against Facebook about the tracking of non -users via its  datr-cookie and social plugins. See: Belgian Commission for the Protection of Privacy, ‘Hof van Beroep wijst eis tegen Facebook af ’, 30 June 2016,  https://www.privacycommission.be/nl/nieuws/hof -van-beroep -wijst-eis-tegen -facebook -af (Dutch). Prior to these legal proceedings, The Guard ian reported  that Facebook has admitted that it tracked non -members, but it stated that the tracking only happened because of a bug that is now being fixed; see: S.  Gibbs, ‘Facebook admits it tracks non -users, but denies claims it breaches EU privacy law’,  The Guardian , 10 April 2015,  https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/10/facebook -admits -it-tracks -non-users -but-denies -claims -it-breaches -eu-privacy -law. From May 2016,  Facebook has indicated that it will deliver ‘better ads’ to everyone, ‘including those who don’t use or aren’t connected to F acebook’. See: Facebook  Newsroom, ‘Bringing people better ads ’, 26 May 2016, https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/05/bringing -people -better -ads/. See also: The Wall Street  Journal, ‘Facebook Wants to Help Sell Every Ad on the Web’, 27 May 2016, https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook -wants -to-help-sell-every -ad-on-theweb-1464321603 .  
 19  intelligence, level of happiness, whether they use addictive substances  and whether their parents are  divorced .     Data protection regulations apply  to the processing of personal data . For example, as adopted by the  Council of Europe in 1981, Co nvention 108 contains the principles for fair and lawful collection and  automatic processing of personal data. The Convention also provides measures of control for individuals,  such as the right to obtain confirmation of whether their personal data are sto red as well as the right to  obtain rectification of such data.13 On the level of the European Union, great efforts have been made to  ‘make Europe fit for the digital age’ by establishing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ,  which will apply from 2 5 May 2018.14 In addition  to this, the e -Privacy Directive ,15 which cover s various  topics , such as the requirement to ask for a user’s consent before , for example,  cookies are stored on his   or her  device, will be  repealed by a e -Privacy Regulati on.16    Interne t  The Internet and personal data processing go hand in hand, considering the broad definition of personal  data.17 Even the processing of an IP  address, used to identify a device connected to the Internet, can  activate the applicability of data protection re gulations.18 The data protection issues that arise from   processing activities via the Internet have been described in great length. With regard to big data  analytics , for example , the use of data for new or incompatible purposes, data maximi sation, lack of  transparency, the possibility  of uncover ing sensitive information, the risk of re -identification, security  implications and incorrect data are all issues that pose challenges to personal data protection (Berlin  Telecom Group 2014). Other implications of (b ig) data analysis that relate to behavio ural targeting  are,  for instance , take-it-or-leave -it choices , for example the use of ‘cookie walls’ that deny people ’s access to  a website unless they consent to the website owner track ing their activities (Zuiderve en Borgesius 2014).     The Council of Europe has addressed numerous of these ‘big data’ issues ; see, for example , Korff  (2013) in the report entitled  ‘The use of the Internet & related services, private life & data protection ’, and  Rouvroy (2016) regarding fundamental rights and freedoms in a world of big data. Indeed, Convention  108 is currently being moderni sed with the aim of addressing the challenges for privacy resulting from  the use of new ICTs,19 and in January 2017 guidelines on big data were  adopted by the Consultative  Committee of Convention 108 .20 In relation to the issue s that arise when data are used for automated  decisions, including profiling , we refer to subsections 3.6 (freedom of expression) and 3.7 (prohibition of  discrimination).     Internet o f Things   Most of the data protection challenges that arise  with regard to Internet services also apply to the Internet  of Things. Similar to websites and apps  that operate via the Internet , machines within the Internet of      13 Article 8 Convention 108.   14 The General Data Protectio n Regulation’s predecessor, Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the  protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, will be repea led on the s ame date.   15 Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data  and the protection of  privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communicat ions), as amended by Directives 2006/24/EC and  2009/136/EC.   16 European Commission, ‘Proposal for an e -Privacy Regulation’, https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/proposal -eprivacy -regulation.   17 Article 2(a) Convention 108 defines ‘personal data’ as any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.

 20  Things can be used to collect data . Think of a car robot that registers its surroundings or monitors its  travel route ( location data ) or a care robot that tracks an elderly person’s face or emotion (biometric  data). Shop owners already use technologies to track their customers within their  shop, or even monitor  people who pass by their shop.21 Tech  companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft have  developed business strategies to gather data in and around the home.22 As a result , one’s ho me – which  used to be  his or hers castle – has become a place where a person’s movements or behavio ur is  continuously being ‘watched’, e.g. via a smartphone, smart meter or smart television. The data collection  via the Internet of Things enables these companies to gain a detailed insight in to the beha viour and lives  of millions of people. Sometimes data collection results from legislation, e.g. the use of smart meters23 or  event data recorders for eCall systems used in cars.24    The rise of the Internet of Things raises issues about the transparency of da ta processing and how the  individual is able to exercise his or her rights as set out in  Convention 108 or the G eneral Data Protection  Regulation  (GDPR) . One of the main pillars of legitimate data processing – the individual’s informed  consent to the propo sed processing activity – will continue to be put under pressure  (see, for example ,  Eskens et al. 2016) . The more ‘smart’ devices surround people, the more difficult it becomes for  individuals to exert control over the data processing activities of all the se devices. To a certain extent, the  processing of these data is covered by data protection regulations, offering the individual certain rights  and safeguards. However , the data can be analy sed and used in a way that affects human rights, most  notably the right to respect for private life in the sense of article 8 ECHR , which protects an individual’s  autonomy, informational privacy and self -determination, among other things. As a consequence , there  might still be an interference with the right to respect fo r private life, even if the party that processes the  personal data – for example  a state or a company – complies with all obligations as stipulated by the  data protection regulations.     Recommendation   Modern -day surveillance via the Internet or the Internet  of Things, performed by states or companies,  inherently involves the processing of personal data. Researchers are still trying to grasp the full extent of  the harmful effects on the lives of individuals caused by such surveillance. The known effects are n ot  comforting. Not only does surveillance have a chilling effect on speech (affecting the freedom of  expression, for example  by preventing  journalists from doing their job  properly ), but it also leads to  behavioural effects. For instance, as a result of su rveillance, individuals conform to perceived group  norms. This conforming effect occurs even when people are unaware that they are conforming (Kaminski  & Witnov 2015). Both states and companies reinforce each other in their surveillance activities, as part  of  the surveillance -innovation complex (Cohen 2016).     Ubiquitous and massive collection of data by governments  has been possible with little fundamental  political and public debate so far, although some institutions , such as (inter)national courts, have  expressed their worries about these matters. For instance, o n an international level, both the European  Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Union have voiced  their concerns on  numerous occasions regarding state surveillance activi ties and the impact on privacy rights.25 For      21 The Dutch Data Protection Authority imposed penalty payments on a company that co uld not demonstrate that Wi -Fi tracking in public spaces was  necessary for a legitimate purpose.

 21  instance when the EU Court of Justice declared the Data Retention Directive to be invalid.26 On a  national level, the British Investigatory Powers Tribunal , for instance , ruled that during a time span of  more than  a decade, the British intelligence agencies illegally collected data about innocent citizens and  illegally tracked their phone and web use.27     With regard to surveillance enacted by companies , the European Commission proposed the reform of  EU data protect ion regulations , which ultimately led to the G eneral Data Protection Regulation . In  addition  to this, the  e-Privacy Regulation has been proposed , which will replace the e -Privacy Directive.     Court rulings28 as well as decisions29 and concerns30 voiced  by regulators show that companies and  states often interfere  with an individual’s right to personal data protection . According to Georgetown  University law professor Julie E. Cohen , ‘[W]e the citizens have been reduced to raw material – sourced,  bartered and min ed in a curiously fabricated “privatised commons” of data and surveillance ’.31 She  concludes that the future of society is dependent on ensuring that our system counters – rather than   reinforces – power asymmetries, ‘allowing all of us to be treated as citi zens, not as raw material ’.32    In the light of the above , we recommend that the Council of Europe take s a stance with regard to the  ubiquitous and massive personal data processing of the modern era, reinforcing the human rights  principles as enshrined in th e conventions.            26 The EU Data Retention Directive 2006/24/EC deals primarily with the retention of certain data which are generated or pro cessed by providers of  publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks.

 22  3.2.2  Right to respect for private life   Right to respect for private life   Over time, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has interpreted ‘the right to respect for private  life’ as laid down in article 8 ECHR, explaining that this right i s a broad term which is not susceptible to  an exhaustive definition. The right to respect for private life is not restricted  to an individual’s home but is  also applicable to other places, such as the workplace. Moreover, with regard to the right to respec t for  priva te life  as protected by article 8 ECHR, the ECtHR  not only focuses on negative freedoms,33 human  dignity and individual autonomy but also on self -expression, personal development and human  flourishing (Van der Sloot 2014).     From a technological p erspective this subsection focuses on ‘ computers  as persuasive technologies’,   which is usually abbreviated to captology. Captology includes the design and analysis of and research on  interactive computing products  (computers, mobile phones, websites, wirel ess technologies, mobile  applications, video games, etc.)  created for the purpose of changing people’s attitudes or behavio urs.34  Persuasive technologies rely on data -gathering, analysis via AI and smart interfaces. First we address   the massive covert use o f persuasive technologies on the Internet and its influence on humans and their  right to respect for private life. Subsequently we reflect on the voluntary use of self -surveillance, for  example via smart wearables, and persuasion. We set out how people use  e-coaches  to (co) -steer their  lives and how this impacts their autonomy and self -determination – either positively or negatively – as  part of the right to respect for private life. Lastly, we describe how persuasive care robots may potentially  interfere with or enhance the right to respect for private life.     Massive psychological experimentation and persuasion on the Internet   Persuasive technologies have been in use for several  decades in the gambling industry, in particular in  computeri sed slot machines (Schüll 2013). By means of compelling digital and video technology, these  slot machines pull players into a trance -like state, which players call the ‘machine zone’, in which their  daily worries, bodily awareness and even their sense of self fade away. Onc e in the ‘zone’, gambling  addicts play not to win, but simply to keep playing. They are merging with the machine, or in other words,  they are caught in the loop of the machine that is designed to entrance them. According to Schüll (2016) ,  these types of sm all, repetitive feedback loops of stimulus and response, so -called compulsion loops ,  which are very absorbing, are used more and more in the world at large, especially in online gamification.     Virtual environments, like the Internet, are to psychology wha t cyclotrons are to physics: living  laboratories (cf. Biocca 2003; Pentland 2014). Smartphone apps or websites , for instance, measure how  people interact with these applications. In this way millions of people are tested on the Internet each day.  Schutz (2 016) speaks about the ‘biggest psychological experiment in history’ . Via A/B testing – a  randomi sed experiment with two or more variables – knowledge is gathered about our behavio ur and  how our brain makes choices. Based on these measurements, the applicat ions automatically adjust their  content in order to  test, for example,  which colour scheme we think looks the best, but also to  persuade  the user to buy an article, click on a certain advertisement or extend his or her time using the application.  Just as i n the case of slot machines, the financial value of an app is mainly driven by the amount of time  consumers use it  for. In Hooked: How to build habit -forming products , Eyal (2014) explains that  designers of apps apply basic slot machine psychology to hook users. For example , Facebook applies  the psychological phenomenon of the fear of missing out (FOMO) to lure its users to spen d time on  Facebook. In his review of various books on how people interact with social and mobile media, Weisberg  (2016, 9) draws a worrisome conclusion: ‘[T]he more you read about it, the more you may come to feel  that we’re in the middle of a new Opium War, in which marketers have adopted addiction as an explicit      33 Such as the notion of ‘the right to be let alone’, as described by Warren and Brandeis (1890).   34 Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, ‘What is captology?’, h ttp://captology.stanford.edu/about/what -is-captology.html.  
 23  commercial strategy. This time the pushers come bearing candy -colored a pps.’ In this respect this could  also be a human rights issue with regard to the right to health.35 Along th e same  lines, Jonathan Harris  makes a comparison between software and medicine ‘in their dual capacities to heal and hurt’  (Harris  2012). Tristan Har ris, co -founder of the advocacy group Time Well Spent,  proposes that engineers  should take a kind of Hippocratic oath which obliges them to develop software that respects people’s  agency (Bosker 2016).  In medicine and biotechnology, it is common  practice  for companies to have an  ethical board or an ethical review committee,  and several pleas have been made to establish such  committees for IT companies and IT research as well (KNAW 2016;  Hern 2016).     Parties developing persuasive technologies apply knowledge  derived from neuroscience and  psychology. There are ethics codes for psychologists and for doing psychological research (see below).  The question is whether parties use, and should use, persuasive technologies according to these codes  of conduct. This is certainly not always the case. For example, in 2012 Facebook and academics from  Cornell University tried to influence the emotions of almost 700 ,000 Facebook users via newsfeeds  (Kramer et al. 2014), without the users’ informed consent or the appropriate approval from an ethics  committee.36 The users had no idea that their emotions were being influenced via predominantly negative  or positive newsfeeds. These influencing activities not only evidently interfere with an individual’s  autonomy and self -determinat ion but also with the individual’s freedom of thought, conscience and  religion (Strand & Kaiser 2015). Another example is online dating service OkCupid, which conducted  experiments designed to test which aspects of a member’s profile had the most influence  on attract ing  other members  of the service (Grimmelman n 2015 ). OkCupid’s co -founder told The Guardian : ‘[I]f you  use the internet, you’re the subject of hundreds of experiments at any given time, on every site. That’s  how websites work .’37 How can people c hoose their own path if organisations , via websites or apps ,  nudge them towards certain emotions and choices? This question becomes especially urgent when  people are not aware that they are being influenced, rendering them practically defenceless against  these influencing activities.      Ethics codes for psychologists and the performance of psychological experiments   The potentially negative effects on humans of experimental, sometimes persuasive, conduct explain why  psychologists and universities have develop ed their own code s of ethics, such as the Universal  Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists or – in Europe – the Meta -Code and the Model Code  of the European Federation of Psychological Associations. These international principles and codes can   provide models for national ones. For instance, the Netherlands Institute of Psychologists (NIP)  developed the Code of Ethics for Psychologists 2015.38 This Code explicitly refers to the ECHR as well  as to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. The obligations arising from these legal  sources for psychologists have been included in the NIP Code insofar as possible.     The NIP Code deals with topics such as the responsibilities, integrity and expertise of the psychologist,  as well as the resp ect they should have for their clients  and includes a description of the complaints  procedure. Article 12 of the NIP Code reads: ‘Psychologists must respect the fundamental rights and      35 See articles 11 and 13 of the Council of Europe’s Revised Social Charter,  for instance.

 24  dignity of the Persons Involved. They must respect [their] right to priv acy and confidentiality.’ With regard  to scientific research, article 85 of the NIP Code stipulates: ‘The psychologist may, if so requested,  provide Data to Third Parties for scientific research purposes. Those Data must be provided in such a  way that they  cannot be traced to the Client, unless that is impossible in light of the purpose of the  research. In that case those Data may be provided only with the Client ’s consent. ’ Comparable to the  Oviedo Convention, the NIP Code deems informed consent important in order to safeguard the client’s  rights and interests.     Even though the NIP Code is aimed at psychologists and not at technology companies developing  robotics or AI , for instance, individuals  should not have less protection merely because they are not i n a  traditional psychologist –client relationship with the entity that is perform ing the psychological experiment.  It is quite remarkable that although  such experiments are being conducted via the Internet (and the IoT)  on a massive scale, the human subject s are unaware of this and have not given their consent to th ese  experimental activities. The NIP Code provides for a complaints procedure , and if the complaint is  successful, then a psychologist’s NIP membership may be terminated. It may not always be clea r to a  citizen whether  he or she has a right  to file a complaint against experimental activities conducted by a  website  owner  or app  owner, and, if so, how this can be done , especially if he or she  is unaware of the  experiment and data protection regulatio ns do not apply, e.g. because no personal data are being  processed.     Voluntary self -surveillance and persuasion in the Internet of Things   People use electronic coaches, or e -coaches, to better manage their lives (Kool et al. 2015) . These ecoach systems o ften use softbots which are integrated in to smart wearables. For example, the Fitbit is a  wrist bracelet which enables self -tracking practices. This device monitors the individual ’s behaviour, such  as their sleep patterns or diet, in order to coach them  to improve their lifestyle ( such as getting  better  sleep, exercising more or losing weight). The sum of the data registered by such an e-coach constitutes  an individual’s data double  and is part of the datafication  of that individual’s daily routine (WRR 201 6).  This is a form of – voluntary – self-surveillance, which is promoted by the so -called quantified self movement. Quantified selfers aim to steer the quality of their lives for the benefit of their autonomy and  self-determination.  Indeed, an e -coach can be beneficial to one’s autonomy by, for example, encouraging  and helping its user to get enough exercise (Kool et al. 2015).     Even though the users of an e-coach have the intention of taking control of their lives, they need to  consider that there are more  parties involved in this technology. The interests of these parties may not be  aligned with those of the e -coach user. For instance, employers could try to oblige their employees to  wear an e -coach in order to track their activities. By doing so, the empl oyer is able to advise or steer  someone into a certain lifestyle. Apart from the evident interference with the individual’s private life, the  data registered by the e -coach may contain health information that should be treated carefully. This is  also an in terference with someone’s informational privacy , since the individual loses control of his  or her   personal information.39 In addition  to the employers, the developers of the e -coaches would also have  control over the collected data. These data are used to ‘ tell’ users how they should adjust their lives.  Here lies the risk of unwanted manipulation in which autonomy turns into heteronomy (Fuchs 2015).  Third parties, as well as the developers,  are also involved in receiv ing data and analys ing them , for their  own commercial purposes , for example . This was reported recently, when the Norwegian Consumer  Council lodged a complaint about the fitness app Runkeeper (which has 33  million registered users      39 The Dutch Data Protection Authority decided negatively about the use of e -coaches by employees which enabled employers to gain insight into, for  example, someone’s sleeping behaviour (health data). See: Autoriteit Persoons gegevens, ‘Verwerking gezondheidsgegevens wearables door werkgevers  mag niet’, 8 March 2016, https://autoriteitpersoonsgegev ens.nl/nl/nieuws/ap -verwerking -gezondheidsgegevens -wearables -door-werkgevers -mag-niet  (Dutch).  
 25  worldwide) with its national Data Protection Authority.40 The Consu mer Council claimed that the app  tracks users and transmits personal data to third parties irrespective of when the app or handset is in  use.    The Rathenau Instituut, i n order to ensure someone’s capability as a  proactive manager of his  or her  life,  recomm ended that technology developers of , for example,  e-coaches should be transparent about the  persuasive methods they apply (Kool et al. 2015). People should be able to monitor the way in which  information reaches them. This also means that transparency abou t the revenue model should be  mandatory. Comparable to care robots  (see below) , e-coaches can provide care in the form of advice,  e.g. lifestyle o r psychological advice. In order to address the issues of the quality of e -coaches and the  responsibility of t heir developers, a seal of approval should  be developed that informs users about the  quality of the e -coaching apps and devices.     Care robots as persuasive technologies   Care robots are designed to provide care to vulnerable groups, such as children, the elderly or disabled   people . Robots can be applied both for the benefit and to the detriment of someone’s autonomy and self determination. Think of robots that improve the autonomy of elderly persons by assisting them when they  change their clothes or take a bath. The Japanese robot Robear, for example, can lift care recipients  from their beds without the help of a human caregiver. Accordingly, these robots could enable elderly  persons to play an active part in society and to live independently, as stated in a rticle 23 of the Council of  Europe’s Revised Social Charter.     In contrast, care robots may also restrain an elderly person when their developers have programme d  them to do so. How pushy may a robot become , for example, in reminding someone to take medicat ion?  What if someone refuses to take medication? The danger of unwanted paternalism comes into play  here.  In this case, the robot technology will force users to take a particular course of action on the basis that  developers know what is best for these use rs (Van de Poel & Royakkers 2011). Sharkey and Sharkey  (2012) argue that the degree to which a robot intervenes will affect the freedom of the care robots. The  risk is that we are on a slippery slope and may create ‘authoritarian robots ’ (Koops 2013).     As stated in chapter 2, physical robots represent embodied AI. This embodiment of the robot offers  opportunities to improve the interaction between humans and machines. Machines, like social care  robots, capitali se on the ability of people to attribute human form, traits, emotions and intentions to  machines. Robotics makes use of this ability to anthropomorphi se to develop social robots so that they   engage with humans on an emotional level (Royakkers & Van Est 2016). Anthropomorphising technology  means that pe ople have a strong tendency to attribute human motivation, characteristics or behaviour to  animals and inanimate objects (ibid.). Engineers may use this powerful social psychological phenomenon  to build persuasive technology. But what are the limits within  which this phenomenon may be used? To  what level do we want to deploy the emotional bond between people and machines? And how do we  ensure that there is no abuse of the trust that is artificially built between humans and machines? Since  people can be addi cted to their cell phone, or to a virtual reality girlfriend, it is completely  conceivable  that people can develop strong feeling s for social ly intelligent artefacts, like social robots. Ylimaula  (2010) argues that technologies, or rather  the actors behind  them, should refrain from taking control over  someone’s life and should remain ‘assistive’ with respect to someone’s autonomy. In that respect the  right to respect for privacy is also about not being controlled  (Zuiderveen Borgesius 2014, 93).         40 Forbrukerrådet, ‘Runkeeper tracks users when the app is not in use’, 13 May 2016, www.forbrukerradet.no/side/runkeeper -tracks -users -when -the-appis-not-in-use/. See also: Forbrukerrådet, ‘Consumer protection in fitness wearables’, November 2016, https://www.forbrukerradet.no/siste -nytt/fitness wristbands -violate -european -law.  
 26  Recommenda tions   In addition to and enabled by mass surveillance and psychological experimentation, persuasion by  means of ICTs is taking place on a massive scale. The Council of Europe could form an opinion about  the psychological experiments involving humans that a re taking place on the Internet and outside the  professional domain of , for example,  psychologists or anthropologists, since these activities could have a  great (negative) impact on a person’s autonomy or self -determination. There are ethics codes for doin g  psychological research. The Council of Europe could clarify whether the firms that are doing the  psychological experiments on the Internet should abide by the same codes.     In order to influence people’s behavio ur, companies and governments make use of p owerful social  psychological phenomenon, like the fear of missing out and anthropomorphism, which could even lead to  addiction and pull people into the ‘machine zone’, causing them to lose their autonomy.  The Council of  Europe could form an opinion on whet her and how persuasion software can be developed that respects  people’s agency. This could mean , for example , that persuasion techniques should neither be too  addictive nor too authoritarian. In this respect, the Council of Europe could  develop fair persua sion  principles, such as  enabling people to monitor the way in which information reaches them, and  demanding that firms  must be transparent about the persuasive methods they apply.     3.2.3  Right to respect for family life   Right to respect for family life   The righ t to respect for private life comprises the right to establish and to develop relationships with other  human beings and the outside world, especially in the emotional field , for the development and fulfilment   of one ’s own personality.  This is referred to a s the right to respect for family life.41    Social skilling and deskilling   Over the last few years , the debate has been  growing on how new ICTs influence people’s  emotional  and social skills and the quality of human relationships. Clinical psychologist and s ociologist Turkle  (2011, 2015) presents an influential voice in this debate. She finds that because many young people are  absorbed in their devices , they  fail to fully develop into independent selves. Researchers at the  University of Michigan, for example,  found a strong decrease in empathy among American students  since the beginning of this century, partly due to the use and content of social media (Konrath et al.  2011). As a result of people’s attachment to their devices, Turkle sees a risk of social  desk illing: the  inability to cope with other humans with their problems and shortcomings and the unwillingness to invest  in human relationships. If we take this to the extreme, fewer  obligatory relationships between humans  and technology could result in an avo idance of human intimacy.     As robots are being outfitted with social abilities, how does this challenge the right to respect for family  life? Certain types of robots are equipped with AI  and are programmed to mimic social abilities in order  to, for example , establish a conversation with their user; for instance , a care robot can use affective  computing  in order to recogni se human emotions and subsequently adjust its behaviour (Van Est et al.  2014). Potentially, robots can stimulate human relationships. Thin k of a care robot, like the Dutch care  robot Alice, that asks the recipients of its care whether  they have recently contacted  their family  members, with the aim of (re-)establish ing contact and maintain ing their relationships. Several studies on  the effect  of Paro, a soft seal robot, in  elderly care  in nursing homes  seem to suggest that the mood of  elderly people improves and that depression levels decrease; their mental condition also improves ,  advancing communication among  those living in the nursing home  and strengthening their social bonds  (cf. Hansen et al. 2010). However, as technology increasingly nestles between us, the risk exist s that  robots could interfere with the right to respect for family life as an (un)intentional consequence of how the      41 Article 8(1) ECHR.  
 27  robot  affects its users. Because of  anthropomorphism , vulnerable people such as the elderly may believe  that a social robot is a actual person, for example their grandchild. If the situation is not treated carefully,  the care receiver may primarily focus on the  care robot instead of , for example, his or her family  members or other humans. Designers and developers should be aware of the strength of a human –robot  relationship  that can be caused by  anthropomorphism.     With regard to virtual or augmented reality tech nologies, similar arguments can be made. These  technologies may improve someone’s ability to establish and develop relationships with human beings.  For instance, such technologies could facilitate communications between family members. Microsoft  Research s howed this during its ‘holoportation’ demonstration.42 On the other hand , it could also  decrease someone’s ability to establish and develop relationships if , for example,  a virtual world is  designed in a way which prevents  the person from entering into (mea ningful) contact with others, and  instead is designed to encourage them to interact with virtual entities. The user may become addicted to  the virtual world, while simultaneously disregarding his or her human relationships .    Recommendation   ICTs can either improve someone’s ability to establish and develop relationships with other human  beings or decrease someone’s ability to establish and develop meaningful relationships with other  human beings. The Council of Europe could form an opinion about how ICTs can  be designed in such a  way that they comply with the right to respect for family life.     3.3 Human dignity   Human dignity   Human dignity is one of the core principles of fundamental rights. It is the basis of most of the values  emphasi sed in the ECHR.43 Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – on which the ECHR  is based – states: ‘All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with  reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood .’ The Charter of  Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms this notion, stating that human dignity is inviolable  and must be respected and protected (article 1). According to the Charter, human dignity includes the  right to life (article 2) and the r ight to the integrity of a person (article 3), among other things.     The ECHR does not explicitly mention ‘human dignity ’. However, its importance has been highlighted in  several legal sources related to the ECHR. For instance, the ECtHR held  that ‘the ver y essence of the  Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom ’.44 Furthermore, with regard to the  application of biology and medicine, the Oviedo Convention explicitly states that parties to this  Convention must  protect the dignity and identity  of all human beings and guarantee everyone, without  discrimination, respect for their integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms.45    Human dignity is not onl y a fundamental right in itself,  but also acts as the basis for freedoms and other  rights (EDPS 2015). Therefore, if the use of technologies interferes with human dignity then these  technologies are likely to interfere with other rights as well, such as the right to respect for private life . In  its report, the JURI  Committee explains that commu nication and interaction with robots have the potential      42 Engadget,‘“Holoportation” demo makes live -video holograms look easy’, 26 March 2016, https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/26/holoportation -demo makes -live-video -holograms -look-easy/ .

 28  to profoundly impact relations , both physical and moral  (JURI  Committee 2017). This section addresses  some of these impacts  with respect to care robots.     3.3.1  Robots taking care of us with dignity   Care ro bots   From a human rights perspective, us ing technologies to aid the elderly should be done  carefully since  elder ly persons may fall within the group of vulnerable people  who are protected by several legal  sources. These sources underline the importance of independent living and full participation in society for  the elderly. Two such sources are  the Council of Europe’s Revised Social Charter  and the Charter of  Fundamental Rights of the European Union.46 Moreover, Recommendation CM/Rec(2014)2 of the  Council of  Europe’s Committee of Ministers on the promotion of the human rights of older persons  underlines that older persons should be able to fully and effectively participate and be included in society  and that all older persons should be able to live their live s in dignity and security, free from  discrimination, isolation, violence, neglect and abuse, and as autonomously as possible. The  Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Thomas Hammarberg, summarised in the  conclusion to his report  that the  human dignity of older persons must always be respected.47 These  considerations should be taken into account when deploying care robots to help the elderly.     Comparable to our observations  made in subsection 3.2 regarding the right to respect for private life, the  use of care robots – assistive technologies – can have positive consequences for someone’s dignity as  well as negative ones. For example, a dehumanising  version of mechanical feeding would provide elderly  people no choice or autonomy with regard to how they would receive their nutrition. In contrast, the users  of My Spoon claimed that this feeding robot gave them back their dignity, because it provided them with  opportunities to be independent and to preserve their privacy when eating (Leroux & La bruto 2012).     Robot design and culture play important roles. The developers of My Spoon acknowledged that some  senior user candidates in South -Korea ‘hate having the bowls right in front of their mouth; they prefer to  eat the food like ordinary people. Th us, we focus mainly on using a tabletop tray ’ (Song & Kim 2012, 47).  Bespoke solutions are thus necessary in order to maintain  dignity, privacy and intimacy without affecting  safety (Vermesan & Friess 2015). For instance, within the EU -funded Value -Ageing project it was  recommended that the robot must be capable of communicating its intention of doing something to the  user, while the user must be able to cancel the intended action or switch off the robot completely (ibid.).     In particular, the development of social robots is a sensitive area. Communication and interaction with  robots may potentially impact relations in our society, both physical and moral  relations . According to the  JURI  Committee, this is especially the case for care robots towards which p eople can develop feelings  and attachment s (JURI  Committee 2017). This causes concerns about  human dignity , among other  things (ibid.). Indeed, it has been argued that it may become humiliating and may damage  self-respect if ,  for example , an elder ly person  is somehow forced to consider inanimate objects as the comprehensive  universe of his or her  own social life (Mordini et al. 2008).     Recommendation   The call for design and development of robotics that preserve human rights has been made recently  during th e 38th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, at which the      46 Article 25 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  stipulates as follows: ‘The Union recognises and respects the rights of the  elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in soci al and cultural life.’   47 Human rights of older persons: participation, equality and dignity, 5th Warsaw Seminar on Human Rights, Warsaw, 29 September –1 October 2011,  Keynote speech by Thomas Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europ e, http://social.un.org/ageing -working group/documents/egm/reference -documents.pdf .  
 29  European Data Protection Supervisor highlighted that engineering techniques and methodologies should  be developed that permit AI and robotics to fully respect the di gnity and rights of the individual (EDPS  2016). The Council of Europe could follow this call  and provid e guidelines on how the individual’s dignity  and rights may be respected, which would allow vulnerable groups such as the elderly to fully and  effectivel y participate  in society  and live their lives in dignity.     3.4 Ownership   Ownership and the right to enjoy possessions   Ownership is a human rights issue: natural persons (human beings) or legal persons who are entitled to  enjoy their possessions should not be d eprived of their possessions except in the cases provided in  article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR. This article directly protects the owner from interference by the  state and it obliges states to protect the owner from interferences in his peaceful enjoyment by third  parties, such as civilians or companies.  The right to property can apply to all sorts of objects, including  intangible goods. The case law of the ECtHR shows that the protection offered by article 1 of the First  Protocol can therefore be broad, as it includes  protection of , among other things , intellectual property  rights, business goodwill, welfare benefits, contractual rights over property and virtual assets such as  domain names (Sganga 2014). How is the notion of ownership challenged i n the current age of  technological convergence?     Two main developments can be distinguished in relation to ownership. Firstly, objects that people  possess – such as their home or land – may become part of a virtual or augmented reality. This begs the  following question: if you own your land, do you also own the virtual space that has been allocated to it  by others?     Secondly, ownership questions arise in relation to the use of an object, such as a roboti sed car or a  smartphone. The issues here are twofold . For a start , these devices are part of the Internet of (Robotic)  Things and are therefore connected to networks. This enables entities other than the user of the device  to have  control over the device, effectively intervening in someone’s use of it. If a device has been  bought, is it possible for the buyer to enjoy his or her possession peacefully when , for example, the  manufacturer or the previous owner can disable or control that device? In addition , the object as part of  the Internet of (Robotic) Thing s (either bought, rented or otherwise used by someone) registers data for  all kinds of purposes. This is especially true with regard to , for example,  a roboti sed car, which needs  these data in order to operate safely. Does the user of the device own the da ta, which can be either  personal data  and activates data protection regulations , or non-personal  data that may fall  within the  scope of other legal regimes such as intellectual property law s? These are difficult questions to answer  on the basis of  current legislation, as a study carried out for the European Commission confirmed that  data ownership is not explicitly dealt with by any EU or national legal instruments (DG CONNECT 2016).     Virtual worlds and augmented reality   Firstly, ownership issues arise when  artefacts created as part of a virtual or augmented reality are placed  ‘on top’ of possessions in the physical world. For instance, when the developer of the game Pokémon Go  put virtual characters – Pokémon – on top of real -world homes and environments fo r the gamers48 to find  and catch, this led to discussions about trespassing, land rights and the legal boundaries of property.49  The developer of the Pokémon game did not ask the land owners for permission to put their game      48 It has been estimated that 45 million people worldwide played the game at  its peak in July 2016. See: Bloomberg, ‘These charts show that Pokemon  Go is already in decline’, 22 August 2016, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016 -08-22/these -charts -show -that-pokemon -go-is-already -indecline.   49 Reuters, ‘Get off my lawn! Poke mon Go tests global property laws’, 22 September 2016, http://www.reuters.com/article/us -landrights -pokemongo idUSKCN11S1GY . 
 30  characters at the same geo -locatio n as the ir physical homes, gardens or other property. Owners of  memorial si tes in the United States, Japan and Germany were not amused by this and wanted to stop  the gamers from finding virtual Pokémon at their physical premises.50 In some cases the game de veloper  responded to their complaints and removed the game characters from the corresponding coordinates of  their property. The Dutch municipality of The Hague sued the game developer because it claimed that  the gamers who were looking for virtual Pokémon demolished protected areas of nature when doing so.  The dispute has been settled out of court and it remains unclear whether  the Dutch municipality invoked  legal arguments relating to property rights as the owner of a so -called Natura 2000 protected area.51     Arguments based on property rights are possible.  In a case brought by US residents in New Jersey,  Florida and Michigan, the plaintiffs are arguing that the virtual Pokémon cause people to physically  trespass on their land.52 They are also claim ing that b y placing virtual game pieces on or near their  private property without their permission, their rights are also violated. According to the game developer,  trespass laws only cover physical intrusions and not virtual ones.  A federal judge will decide whethe r this  case can continue .    Controlling an object in the age of the Internet of Things   When it comes to physical objects, such as  cars, houses and land, we have a rather straight forward  idea  of what ownership means. Under certain conditions, ownership gives  a person the exclusive right to  enjoy, occupy, possess, rent, use, give away or even destroy their property. Digital technologies may  shift the nature and notion of ownership. For example, in contrast to a physical book, which you own if  you buy it, buyin g an e -book means you merely pay for  a licence to read the book. That means the ebook vendor can delete the digital book from your device without warning. In 2009 this actually  happened, when Amazon remotely deleted Orwell’s 1984  from the Kindles of surpr ised readers without  explanation.53 Perzanowski and Schultz (2016) hold that consumers should be better informed about the  trade -offs of licen ce agreements – such as  privacy, permanence and user constraints – and argue that  introducing aspects of private pr operty and ownership into the digital marketplace would affirm our sense  of self -direction and autonomy.     Physical objects connected to the Internet of Things , such as  robots, cars or even printers, also raise  questions  about ownership . As these devices an d their software become intertwined with and connected  to networks, this enables the manufacturer to effectively control , for example, a  robot or a device even  after it has been bought. This is possible because  remote access can be gained via the Internet by the  manufacturer or as part of the software’s design that is implemented in the device. As a consequence,  the individual owning a robot or a device is hindered in his or her peaceful enjoyment of th is possession.  For instance, a US tractor manufacturer argue d – on the basis of  its intellectual property rights relating to   the tractor’s software – that it continued to  own the software, even after farmers had purchased the  tractor (Coyle 2016). Some tractor owners even buy modified software to circumvent th e unauthori sed  repair locks put in the tractor’s software by the manufacturer  (Koebler 2017) . Another example is a  software update issued by Hewlett Packard for its printers. Consequently, the printers were no  longer       50 United States: R. Nakashima & M.

 31  able to use third -party ink cartridges.54 In other cases , manufacturers may disable the owner’s access to  the device, if this is allowed according to the manufacturers’ terms and conditions (Brodkin 2013) .     The connected object can in some cases be controlled by its previous owner as well as th e  manufacturer, as a researcher who worked for IBM discovered . He sold his car but was still able to  control it using the car’s mobile app.55    These examples show that in the current world it is not self -evident that one can exclusively interact with  or oth erwise use goods such as robots or devices, even if these goods have been purchased. It is  possible that some of these issues can be addressed via existing legal instruments that are part of  consumer law, competition law or intellectual property law. Howev er, another perspective could be based  on the right to property  and could  argue that once an object has been bought, the manufacturer or other  parties may not interfere with this possession unless the owner has provided his or her permission (e.g.  for software updates).     Ownership of (personal) data   The ‘things ’ that are  part of the Internet of Robotic Things register all kinds of data. For instance, a  roboti sed car collects and analyses the data which are needed to assist the driver or – in the case of sel fdriving cars – safely drive the car autonomously. The data relate to elements such as the vehicle’s  performance and its position compared to other objects. Who owns the data that has been ‘extracted’  from the device or has been otherwise registered as pa rt of a person’s use of the device? Before we  examine the possible answers to this question , we describe the role of data in the Internet of Robotic  Things in more detail.     The collection, analysis and use of data happen in a cycl ical manner. This has been  called the digital or  cybernetic loop . The collected data – for example  information about traffic congestion and how to avoid it  – is analysed  and subsequently used: the driver receives information in his or her car about how he or  she can efficiently continue on  the route without getting caught in traffic or, with regard to self -driving  cars, how the car c an efficiently and automatically divert its route. The steps of data collection, analysis  and use have been described as the (big) data value chain . In order to refine the data, the steps of the  big data value chain are repeated. The information gathered as part of the digital loop may be shared  with other cars which are also connected to each other via a network. In this way, a whole fleet may  ‘learn’ ab out the traffic congestion and how to avoid it ( fleet learning ). The real -time, accurate information  also enable s other parties involved in the big data value chain, such as road maintenance  workers , to  quickly and precisely take the appropriate measures i n case of , for example,  a traffic jam (Moerel & Prins  2016).     The data generated by roboti sed cars are valuable. The data make it possible to develop self -driving cars  and provide an insight in to the activities and behavio ur of the car’s passengers. Becaus e of its value,  various parties claim the vehicle’s data (fully or partly) as their own. For instance, car manufacture rs and  advertising companies make ‘ownership’ claims (Sharman 2015). Yet the concept of data ownership is  hard to define and difficult to apply in practice. This is because of complex assignments of different rights  in data transactions across different stakeholders (Cattaneo et al. 2016). This is true with regard to both  personal  data and non-personal  data. Absolute control over personal  data is difficult to guarantee, given  other concerns such as the public interest and the rights and freedoms of others (EDPS 2015). In this  respect , the European Data Protection Supervisor notes that under EU law, ‘the analogy of ownership  cannot be applied as such to personal information, which has an intrinsic link to individual personalities’      54 BBC, ‘HP apologises for ink -blocking update’, 29 September 2016, www.bbc.com/news/technology -37503139.   55 CNN tech, ‘Why buying used cars could put your safety at risk’, 17 February 2017, http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/17/technology/used -car-hack -safety location/ .  
 32  (EDPS 2015) . Not everyone agrees with this notion. Data ownership may be a useful concept when  considering personal data  as a rivalrous resource. Here, though, the qu estion is whose property  personal  data should be (Purtova 2013). The purpose of this concept is to strengthen natural persons’ position in  the digital ecosystem. According to the legal scholar Purtova, property rights have to be assigned in  personal data t o the data subject, including a default of ‘non-disclosure’ and ‘no use of personal data’ . If  this is not done , then this would amount to the legitimi sation of property rights being ‘grabbed’ by the  information industry. Purtova states that this would rend er ‘the individual defenceless in the face of  corporate power eroding his autonomy, privacy and right to information self -determination’ (Purtova  2013, 2) .    Legal scholars have opted for the idea that propertisation of personal data acknowledges the curren t  commodification of personal data: customers should be fairly compensated for their personal information  which is ‘traded’ . For instance , data can be collected following  a person’s use of a roboti sed car, which is  then sold by the car manufacturer to , for example,  an advertising company. It has been argued that a  data ownership model could facilitate this ‘trade’ by making sure that  the person who generates the data  due to his driving is compensated (EDPS 2015). The question remains as to whether this conc ept could  be beneficial to someone’s fundamental rights, e.g. in terms of human dignity. For example, if a  robot or  softbot equipped with AI obliges a human to supply  ‘his or her ’ data in order to provide a certain service  or answers in return, then certai n risks arise for the individual. In this respect , Christl and Spiekermann  (2016, 150) note that ‘data ownership (or legal property rights) embedded in data exchange policies bear  the risk of an extensive commodification of the self’ . This could potentiall y lead to a situation in which  people with a low or very low income have to provide data in exchange for the service while those who  have a higher income pay for the service without having to provide  (personal) information. Indeed, the  European Data Protec tion Supervisor warns against the idea that people can pay with their data in the  same way that they do with their money. Fundamental rights cannot be reduced to consumer interests,  and personal data cannot be considered as a mere commodity , according to t he European Data  Protection Supervisor (EDPS 2017). These are the potential negative effects of a data ownership  concept aimed at providing compensation for the individual.     With regard to non-personal  data, ‘data ownership’ deals with various types of leg al claims covered by  intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright or database protection rights), trade secrets, antitrust  regulations, contractual rights, public sector information laws or other regulations. Thus, the question  about data ownership is not always the appropriate question if , for example , someone wants to  determine his or her rights to access and use the data for specific purposes. When exchanging data,  determining the type of data  produced  or collected, etc. is key to determin ing the appropr iate legal data  ownership regime (Cattaneo et al. 2016).     Businesses have objected to the need to regulat e ownership issues relating to  non-personal data,  referring to contractual freedom as well as a fear that possible regulation could stifle innovation and  impede the development of the market.56 Without a precedent from the ECtHR on this matter, it is not  clear whether data qualify as possessions , although this has not been ruled out by legal scholars (Tjong  Tjin Tai 2016). The question remains , however , who should be entitled to such ownership , e.g. the  consumer, the robot’s manufacturer or perhaps someone else.  It is clear that  questions about allocating  data ownership rights to one or the other party may not be welfare -maximi sing and cannot easily be  answered (Duch -Brown et al. 2017).         56 European Commission, Synopsis report on the contributions to the public consultation regulatory environment for data and clou d computing, 24  September 2015 –6 January 2016, paragraph 4.2.4, https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/synopsis -report -contributions -public -consultation regulatory -environment -data-and-cloud .  
 33  Recommendations   This section provided a brief look at how the peaceful enjoyment of possessions is challenged by the use  of emerging technologies. Virtual objects may result in interference with the owner’s property , bough t  devices can be disabled without the owner’s control and the data value chain leaves us with questions  about how ‘data ownership’ relat es to, for example,  negotiating access, control and the ability to use and  reuse data. This makes ‘data ownership’ – either as  a possession in the sense of article 1 of the First  Protocol to the ECHR or as ‘propertisation’ of (personal) data , for example  – a concept worth the Council  of Europe  considering . The Council of Europe could proactively provide guidance on these ma tters,  setting the boundaries within which someone may enjoy his or her (in)tangible possessions and defining  how others have to respect those boundaries.     3.5 Safety, responsibility and liability   Safety, responsibility and liability   Tort rights are human righ ts (Van Dam 2013). For example, the ECHR obliges the contracting states to  provide an effective remedy, often discharged by the national tort law remedies (ibid.). This makes the  safety of robots a human rights issue. In this section w e elaborate on this m atter with a pri mary focus on  car roboti sation.     The automotive industry has made cars more and more intelligent . This is the long -term trend of car  roboti sation  (Royakkers & Van Est 2016). From the 2000s onwards, cars have gradually received  automated ca pabilities, such as cruise control and park assist systems. The European Parliament’s  Science and Technology Options Assessment holds that safety aspects should be one of our primary  concerns, i.e. finding ways for robots and humans to work together withou t having accidents (STOA  2016). Semi -autonomous vehicles need a human driver with his or her eyes on the road, ready to  intervene when the car makes a wrong assessment of the situation. Since current technology still needs  human involvement , it has been ar gued that the term ‘auto pilot ’ that has been used by Tesla is  misleading.57 Many believe that in the future the self -driving car will become an everyday phenomenon,  enabling its passengers to ride with their eyes off the road and their hands off the wheel.  The path to fully  automated autonomous driving involves an ongoing automation and interconnection of vehicles and the  traffic’s infrastructure (Royakkers & Van Est 2016).     The JURI Committee  finds that the civil liability for damage caused by robots is a  ‘crucial issue which  needs to be analysed and addressed in order to ensure the same degree of efficiency, transparency and  consistency in the implementation of legal certainty throughout the EU for the benefit of citizens,  consumers and businesses alike ’ (JURI  Committee 2017). At this stage, though, it  is clear that  the  following potential actors can be identified who may bear the blame when there is  a car crash: the car  manufacturer, the software builders who programmed the car’s AI, the seller, the buyer  and the road  authority. Addressing the issue of responsibility and liability will depend on the level of automation of the  car. The levels of automation for ‘on -road motor vehicles’ have been classified by the global association  SAE International.58 The as sociation’s classification scheme, which has been used by , for example,  the  U.S. Department of Transportation as part of its Federal Automated Vehicles Policy,59 defines six levels  of automation. The levels range from no automation (level 0) to full automat ion (level 5). In between lie  vehicles with driver assistance capabilities (level 1), advanced driver assistance/partial automation (level  2), conditional automation (level 3) and highly automated driving (level 4).       57 Reuters, ‘Germany say s Tesla should not use “Autopilot” in advertising’, 16 October 2016, www.reuters.com/article/us -tesla -germany idUSKBN12G0KS.   58 SAE International’s new standard J3016: Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On -Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Sys tems,  http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf .  59 U.S. Department of Transportation, ‘Federal Automated Vehicles Policy’, https://www.transportation.gov/AV.  
 34    Automation l evels 0–2: From conventiona l driving to partial automation   With conventional driving (level 0), a human driver has his or her eyes on the road and both hands on the  wheel of the vehicle, although  warning or intervention systems as well as automatic transmission  may be  in place . With  regard to level 0 vehicles, the rules regarding how liability should be apportioned  have  been widely established. In principle, the car’s manufacturer is liable when the damage occurred  because of  a defect in its product, the car. A defect can consist  of, for example,  brakes physically not  working, but also software bugs may lead to failure of the vehicle’s functions.60 What is considered  defective depends on what might have been expected of the car given the circumstances. In addition , the  road authority m ay be held liable if the road does not meet the requirements needed for safe travel. The  driver may be liable for damage caused by the vehicle, unless he or she can successfully prove force  majeure . Although legal interpretations may vary on the European c ontinent, force majeure cannot  usually be invoked by the vehicle’s owner if a defect suddenly occurs, even if there was  a fail ure in the  driver assistance system , such as cruise control or the park assist systems (levels 2 and 3 respectively)  (Royakkers & Van Est 2016).     With regard to conventional driving (level 0), driver assistance (level 1) and certain forms of advanced  driver assistance , such as park assist systems (level 2) , ‘no legislative, regulatory or guidance changes  [are] needed for existing te chnologies ’, the British government concluded in July 2016 (Department for  Transport 2016, 16). In sum, when the driver is at all times in complete control of the vehicle , then –  apart from certain exceptions and different national interpretations – how li ability should be apportioned   is fairly clear.     Automation l evels 3–4: From conditional automation to highly automated driving   Automation l evels 3 and 4 apply to  vehicles in which the driver can (temporar ily) take his or her hands of f  the wheel (level 3) and his  or her  eyes of f the road (level 4). Level 3 is referred to as conditional  automation , which is  ‘the driving mode -specific performance by an automated driving systems of all  aspects of the dynamic driving task ’.61 With a utomation l evel 3 it is expect ed that a human driver will  respond appropriately to a request to intervene.62 Examples are remote control parking, motorway assist  and mid-range platooning. The la st is an example of cooperative driving in which cars or trucks are  mutually linked through e lectronic communication by cooperative systems (Royakkers & Van Est 2016).  As a ‘platoon’ of these cars drive s close to each other and exchange s information about , for example,   their speed, position and acceleration, the  cars become autonomous and the driv ers’ hands can be taken  off the steering wheel. Highly automated, level 4, systems perform all aspects of the dynamic driving  tasks, including  when a human driver does not respond appropriately to an intervention request.63  Advanced platooning and a full mo torway pilot are examples of this level of automation. These are future  technologies (Department for Transport 2016).     Most discussions about the liability issues that arise from the use of autonomous driving are about  automa tion levels 3 and 4, in which t he driver can switch the autonomous mode on or off and remains (at  least in part) able to operate the vehicle. With regard to liability and the Tesla car with autopilot feature s,  Tesla thinks the main responsibility lies with the driver. Tesla says that th e term ‘autopilot’, just as in  aeroplanes, raises the expectation that there will be a human pilot too. In Tesla’s view, ‘ [T]he onus is on      60 See, for instance: C BS News, ‘Okla. jury: Toyota liable in sudden acceleration crash’, 25 October 2013, www.cbsnews.com/news/okla -jury-toyota liable -in-sudden -acceleration -crash/ ; BBC, ‘Volvo recalls 59,000 cars over software fault’, 20 February 2016, www.bbc.com/news/world -europe -3562275 ;  and Tech Times, ‘Nissan recalls Infiniti Q50 sedans over steering glitch, promises  software fix’, 18 June 2016,  www.techtimes.com/articles/165624/20160618/nissan -recalls -infiniti -q50-sedans -over-steering -glitch -promises -software -fix.htm.   61 SAE International, ‘U.S. Department of Transportation’s new policy on automated vehicles adopts SA E International’s levels of automation for defining  driving automation in on -road motor vehicles’, 22 September 2016, https://www.sae.org/news/3544/.   62 Ibid.  63 Ibid. 
 35  the pilot to make sure the autopilot is doing the right thing’ .64 This stance has led to some critical  response s, for example : ‘If it’s controlled by an algorithm, why should you be liable? ’65 Tesla claims that  its drivers accept the ‘autopilot ’ conditions when accepting its terms and conditions: the car is mere ly in a   ‘beta’ phase.66 However , this notion may leave non -contractual parties in the dark about their position,  since terms and conditions would only bind the contractual party, the car’s owner, not other people.  Should it be accepted that they may be in an AI and car robotics experiment, as unwilling participants?  And what about outside sensors that aid the car ? Should someone keep track of these sensors that aid  connected, cooperative and automated driving systems, comparable to an air traffic controller? If so,  what should his or her responsibility  be? Is it accept able to state that a vehicle, driving on the public  roads, is in a beta phase ? It has been reported that German authorities would not have approved a beta phase Tesla autopilot.67 In this respect it is worth nothing that Volvo has stated it will accept full  liability  whenever one of its cars is in autonomous mode , making it one of the first car makers in the world to  make such a promise.68 This statement follows Volvo’s survey in which 79 % of respondents stated t hat  they would  expect the manufacturer to accep t liability.69    Levels 3 and 4 prove the most difficult when dealing with liability issues. The driver’s liability for damage  caused to  other motori sed road users is generally assessed on the basis of tort  and is  attributable when  the damage is the driver’s  fault (Royakkers & Van Est 2016). Driver assistance systems complicate  things if they do not function properly . And the driver alone cannot be blamed when certain hazards are  encountered, for instance sudden unforeseeable situations that the driver could not reasonably take into  consideration. Also, if driver assistance systems actually allow drivers to better respond to road hazards,  this may affect their liability, since a driver cannot claim that he or she was in an unforeseen situation if  the system wa rned him  or her  about , for example,  a slippery surface. It also becomes hard to assess  liability questions when a driver has failed to activate  a function,  for example  a collision avoidance  system , which could have prevented the damage.     With regard to co operative systems and autonomous cars, the car’s damaging acts can be traced back  to external causes. For instance, a cooperative system may have missed a warning for a local hazard  because of  a defective roadside system (Royakkers & Van Est 2016). As a ge neral rule the injured party  should be able to prove this defect, but it is a complex task  . With regard to driver assistance systems  (levels 2 and 3), liability for the damage can possibly be proved by examining , for example,  a defective  software system. However, with regard to cooperative systems and autonomous cars, the incorrect  functioning of such systems may have several causes , and providing suggestive evidence as part of e.g.  legal proceedings may be difficult in practice . Black boxes or eCall syste ms may address these issues,  recording the car’s behavio ur.70 The German Federal Cabinet  has adopted a draft law that requires  manufacturers of semi -autonomous cars to install a black box , which helps to determine responsibility i f      64 Bloomberg TV, ‘Elon Musk on Tesla’s auto pilot and legal liability’, 10 October 2014, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60 -b09XsyqU .  65 Rosemary Shahan, president of the Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety lobbying group in: LA Times, ‘Tesla’s “autopilot mode” puts it at risk for  liability in crashes’, 6 July 2016, www.latimes.com/business/technology/la -fi-tn-tesla -liabilty -20160705 -snap -story.html .   66 Tesla, ‘A tragic loss’,  30 June 2016, https://www.tesla.com/blog/tragic -loss.   67 Reuters, ‘German authority would not have approved beta -phase Tesla autopilot: newspaper', 10 July 2016, www.reuters.com/article/us -germany -teslaidUSKCN0ZQ0IM.   68 Volvo Car Group, ‘US urged to establish nationwide federal guidelines for autonomous driving’, 7 October 2015,  https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en -gb/media/pressreleases/167975/us -urged -to-establish -nationwide -federal -guidelines -for-autonomous -driving .   69 K.

Thielman, ‘The customer is always  wrong: Tesla lets out self -driving car data – when it suits’, The Guardian , 3 April 2017, https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/03/the customer -is-always -wrong -tesla -lets-out-self-driving -car-data-when -it-suits.  
 36  there is  an accident.71 Evidently, tracking and recording systems such as black boxes challenge privacy  and data protection rights.     Automation l evel 5: Full automation   Even though automation level 5 is currently in an experimental phase, such full automation would have  clear impli cations for liability schemes. With no eyes on the road or hands on the wheel, such  autonomous cars shift the responsibility for avoiding accidents to the manufacturer (Royakkers & Van Est  2016). A driverless car is then comparable to a bus, of which the p assenger has no control. Common  carriers, such as bus companies, must  maintain the highest possible standards of care and protect the  lives of the passengers. This means that care manufacturers would be liable for even slight negligence ,  and the lives of t he driverless car’s passenger s are in the hands of the manufacturer (ibid.).     The liability of the road authorities might need clarification, since the self -driving cars will most likely  depend (in part) on digital roadside systems. The question is whether  these systems are ‘road  equipment ’ for which the road authorities are responsible (Royakkers & Van Est 2016). Defining roadside  systems and their underl ying computer systems as road equipment could prove to be a solution to this  question. This definition can be established by following , for example,  the ‘Declaration of Amsterdam ’,72  in which the EU ministers of transport declared that the European Commission will continue to work  closely with the industry and EU member states to create the conditions needed  for connected vehicles  to start using  European roads in 2019.73    How liability will be apportioned  when a robot is involved i n causing  damage or injuries is a matter of  choice – taking all circumstances into account in relation to risk  and insurance, etc. As a princip al rule,  the car’s manufacturer should be held responsible. This is the point of view of the German minister of  transport.74 The U.S. Department of Transportation notes that the determination of who or what is the  ‘driver ’ of automated vehicles does not necessarily determine liability for crashes involving that vehicle. It  notes that states of the US may determine that in some circumstances liability for a crash involving a  human driver of an automated vehicle should be assigned to the manufactur er of the vehicle.75   The current laws and regulations may not fit properly in relation to robots acting autonomously, especially  – as we have seen – with regard to levels 3 and 4 of car automation. As roboti sed cars become more  autonomous and advanced, it can become difficult to apportion  responsibility between the car’s  manufacturers and its users . Therefore clarification on this issue of liability is needed.     Recommendation   Civil liability and insurance are not uncommon areas for the Council of Europe  to consider . The Council  opened the European Convention on Compulsory Insurance against Civil Liability in respect of Motor  Vehicles in 1959 and it  entered into force in 1969.76 The Council of Europe could pave the way  for further  development in this area , suggesting  guidelines on how to apportion  liability with regard to robotics.      71 Bundesrat, ‘Entwurf eines ... Gesetzes zur Änderung des Straßenverkehrsgesetzes’, adopted on 25 January 2017,  https://www.bundesrat.de/SharedDocs/beratungsvorgaenge/2017/0001 -0100/0069 -17.html (German).

In March 201 7, 29 European countries signed a letter of intent to intensify cooperation to test connected and automated road  transport in cross border test sites: European Commission, ‘EU and EEA Member States sign up for cross border experiments on cooperative, conne cted  and automated mobility’, 23 March 2017, https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/eu -and-eea-member -states -sign-cross -border -experiments cooperative -connected -and-automated .   74 Wirtschafts Woche, ‘Dobrindt gründet Ethikkommission für automatisiertes Fahren’, 8 September 2016, www.wiwo.de/politik/europa/selbstfahrende autos -dobrindt -gruendet -ethikkommission -fuer-automatisiertes -fahren/14513384.html .  75 U.S. Department of Transportation, ‘Federal A utomated Vehicles Policy’, https://www.transportation.gov/AV.   76 Also, in 1973 the Council of Europe opened the European Convention on Civil Liability for Damage caused by Motor Vehicles. Un fortunately, this  convention was never enforced because the minimum  number of required ratifications had not been reached.  
 37  Various liability models may be considered, such as ‘shared’ responsibility (between , for example,  the  robot designer, developer, programmer, manufacturer, seller and user), a model in which robot  developers are liable for harm caused by their robots , or a model that is something in between. The JURI   Committee suggests , for instance, that  liability should be proportionate to the actual level of instructions  given to the robot and to i ts degree of autonomy (JURI  Committee 2017).     The guidance  offered by the Council of Europe  could be the outcome of a balancing act: balancing the  freedom of conduct (of Tesla and others) against the protection of (human) rights and interests of others  (e.g. car drivers, pedestrians, etc.). When performing this balancing act, the existence of a compensation  fund (e.g. liability insurance) is one of the factors that need s to be taken into account. The JURI  Committee believes that a n insurance system should o blige the autonomous robot’s producer to take out  insurance, which should be supplemented by a fund in order to ensure that compensation must be paid if  there is  no in surance policy that covers the risks  (JURI  Committee 2017).     3.6 Freedom of expression   Freedo m of expression   The first paragraph of article 10 ECHR stipulates that everyone has the freedom of expression.77 This  right includes the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without  interference by a public authority and regardless of frontiers.  The second paragraph of article 10  stipulates the circumstances in which  legitimate interference with the exercise of freedom of expression  is possible. In certain cases, article 9 ECHR may apply. This article protects the right to  freedom of  thought, conscience and religion. However, i nterferences with article 9 will often be treated as giving rise  to issues arising  within the scope of a rticle 10  (Murdoch 2012).  This section focusses on article 10  ECHR.     AI promoting or hindering t he right to impart information and ideas without  interference   Automated decisions can promote or hinder a free flow of information. If the AI programmer provides the  user with tools to gather and disseminate information, then this could favo ur the right of  freedom of  expression. For instance, tools that bring together RSS  feeds from newspaper sites can be helpful to  impart information in an easy manner. However, if AI solely determines what information is to be shown,  it challenges the freedom to receive an d impart information and ideas without interferences , as protected  by article 10 ECHR. For instance, there is a risk that an ‘information cocoon’, ‘echo chamber’ (Sunstein  2001) or ‘ filter bubble’  (Pariser 2011) will be created  that hinders, among other th ings, our ability to freely  develop our opinions. Limits may even arise when we are (automatically) selecting information out of a  seemingly infinite pool. For example , Google’s personalised search results depend , at least in part,  on  our previous search h istory.78 According to the EU –Council of Europe youth partnership report , ‘Both  cases of information restriction – individual decisions or automated algorithms – might lead to the loss of  relevant “alternative” information that should be included in the dec ision making process of active  participation ’ (Zentner 2015, 49) .    So, should we worry about filter bubbles?  In 2016 , researche rs concluded that there is no empirical  evidence that warrants any strong worries about filter bubbles  at the moment (Zuiderveen Borgesius et  al. 2016). Nevertheless, the researchers note that a debate about filter bubbles is important, since      77 See also article 19 of the UN Human Rights Declaration: ‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this ri ght includes freedom to  hold opinions without interference and to seek, r eceive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.’ See also article  11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .  78 Wired, ‘Exclusive: How Google’s algorithm rules the web’, 2 October 2010, https://www. wired.com/2010/02/ff_google_algorithm/, see also Google,  ‘Personalized search for everyone’, December 4, 2009, https://googleblog.blogspot.nl/2009/12/personalized -search -for-everyone.html.  
 38  problems for democracy could arise if personalisation technology  further  improves and personalised  news becomes people’s main information sour ce. Currently approximately  12% of Internet users  worldwide use social media as their main source of news (Newman et al. 2016, 7). Zuiderveen Borgesius  et al.  (2016)  argue that more evidence is needed on the process and effects of personalisation so we can   shift the basis of policy discussions from fear to insight.      When AI interferes with the right to freedom of expression   Bozdag (2013) claims that Google and Facebook have become central information gatekeepers of our  society. Facebook claims that it is n ot a traditional media company  but acknowledges that it has  responsibilities for the way its platform is used .79 The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ)  finds that for the above -mentioned  12% of users that use social media as their main sou rce of news ,  ‘Facebook is by far the most important network for finding, reading/watching, and sharing news’  (Newman et al. 2016, 7).     Online gatekeeping services are a mix of human editors and software code designed by humans. In May  2016 , Facebook recei ved allegations that its ‘trending topics’ section deliberately showed less  conservative political views, as opposed to liberal topics. Facebook denied the allegations ; their internal  investigation ‘has revealed no evidence of systematic political bias in the selection or prominence of  stories included in the Trending Topics feature’  but also indicated it  could not fully exclude the possibility  of unintentional bias. 80 Accordingly, t he company changed the trending topics  feature  ‘to prevent  potential misuse  and to minimise risks where human judgment is involved ’.81 In September 2016 ,  Facebook removed a post from its site containing the famous photograph of the Vietnamese ‘napalm girl ’  because it was in breach of the website’s policy regarding nudity.82 The pho to was later reinstated. It is  assumed that the post was tagged for removal by an algorithm and then was followed up by a human  editor.83 This indicate s that algorithmic gatekeeping assistance does not remove all human biases. As  Bozdag (2013, 224) explains : ‘Technical biases such as third party manipulation or popularity will exist  due to the computerized form of gatekeeping. Also, individual factors such as personal judgments,  organizational factors such as company policies, external factors such as govern ment or advertiser  requests will still be present due to the role of humans in providing these services. ’     Information gatekeepers can have a financial incentive to refrain from (unwilling ly) support ing, for  example,  hateful or offensive content . For inst ance, Google’s video platform You Tube showed  advertisements next to offensive content such as homophobic and anti -Semitic videos. Consequently ,  certain  advertised companies deserted Google for failing to keep its advertisements away from  hate-filled  videos .84 Google  said in response that it would hire significantly more  human  staff and would speed up  the process of removing advertisements from hateful and offensive content.  Recently, Facebook  shareholders proposed a report on ‘the threat to democracy and fre e speech from so -called fake news      79 Reuters, ‘Facebook CEO says group will not become a media compan y’, 29 August 2016, www.reuters.com/article/us -facebook -zuckerberg idUSKCN1141WN .

 39  spread on the social media forum, and the dangers it may pose to the company itself’.85 Shareholders  suggest ed that  the company should  carry out a broad review of the issue, ‘including the extent to which it  blocks fake pos ts, how its strategies impact free speech and how it evaluates claims in posts’.86     Incentives in favour of combatting hate speech online can also be found in laws. Germany drafted a law  which aims to force social networks like Facebook to quickly remove libellous  or threatening online  posts.87 If the social networks do not comply, then the y face fines of up to 50  million euros. It remains to  be seen whether this is an effective solution to the problem, especially since it is not always clear where  someone’s  protected freedom of expression ends, given the lack of a watertight or authoritative definition  of ‘hate speech ’ (McGonagle 2013).  The same hold s true with regard to defamatory information : it is not  always clear to the online intermediary (such as a soc ial network) how to respond appropriately to certain  user-generated information it facilitates , as can be observed from the various ECtHR  cases concerning  defamatory user -generated content .88 Therefore, the risk exists that parties like Facebook may  unjusti fiably delete posts or comments  – whether or not with the aid of automated tools – in reaction to  defamation or hate speech claims which would interfere with someone else’s freedom of expression. It  therefore comes as no surprise that a consumer group in G ermany opposes  the draft law, stating that it  is the wrong approach and will  make social networks into ‘content police ’.89    Recommendations   According to the ECtHR , not only does the media have the task of imparting information and ideas that  are in the  public interest  but the public also has a right to receive them.90 Facebook might be the world’s  biggest  news outlet , with over 1 .86 billion active users worldwide , but i t is still unclear whether Facebook  should be regarded as a media company and news editor a nd, if so, should assume its related proper  role and responsibility as a ‘public watchdog’ in our democratic society. The Council of Europe could  provide clarification on information gatekeepers, such as  Google and  Facebook , their  role as news  editor s and their possible duties as public watchdog s. In addition, the Council of Europe could provide a  blueprint as to how central information gatekeepers, like Google and Facebook, could use their  algorithmic powers for the benefit of human rights, especially in r elation to the right to receive and impart  information and ideas.91    3.7 Prohibition of discrimination   Prohibition of discrimination   Article 14 ECHR states that the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in the ECHR shall be  secured without discrimination  on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or  other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other      85 Reuters, 'Facebook shareholders propose reports on 'fake news', pay equality', 14 April 2017, www.reuters.com/article/us -facebook -fakenews idUSKBN17H01A.   86 Ibid.  87 Reuters, ‘Germany plans to fine soc ial media sites over hate speech’, 14 March 2017, www.reuters.com/article/us -germany -fakenews idUSKBN16L14G .   88 ECtHR (Grand Chamber) 16 June 2015, application no. 64569/09 ( Delfi AS v Estonia) ; ECtHR 2 February 2016, application no. 22947/13 ( MTE &  Index.hu ZRT v Hungary ); ECtHR 9 March 2017, application no. 74742/14 ( Pihl v Sweden ).  89 As stated by Volker Tripp, head of the Digital Society Association consumer group in: Reuter s, ‘German cabinet agrees to fine social media over hate  speech’, 5 April 2017, http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk -germany -hatecrime -facebook -idUKKBN1771FK .  90 ECtHR 26 April 1979, application no. 6538/74 ( The Sunday Times v the United Kingdom  (no. 1)), paragraph 65.   91 Building upon Recommendation CM/Rec(2012)3 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of human rights w ith regard to  search engines a nd Recommendation CM/Rec(2012)4 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the protection of human rights with regard to  social networking services.  
 40  status.92 Protocol No. 12 to the ECHR seeks to ensure  that nobody shall be di scriminated against on any  ground by any public authority.     AI combatting or enabling discrimination   The delegation of decision -making to AI may provide an opportunity to combat discrimination. For  example, AI tools have been developed with the aim of eliminat ing bias from the hiring process , such as  a tool that automatically alerts the hirer to the use of potentially biased language in job descriptions.93  Virtual reality technologies have even been deployed to promote diversity in education and to combat  discrimination.94    As we have seen throughout this report, technologies can also be used to interfere with human rights.  This is also true with regard to the prohibition of discrimination. Racist groups may use AI to propagate  their message (Council of Euro pe 2012). Besides such type s of intentional use of AI to discriminate  against others , unintentional algorithmic discrimination , e.g. racism, also exists. For instance, in 2015  Google’s Photo s app tagged a picture of two black people as ‘Gorillas ’. This tag  was the result of  Google’s AI , which suggest s categories and tags based on machine learning. Google removed the tags  and apologi sed: ‘There is still clearly a lot of work to do with automatic image labeling, and we’re looking  at how we can prevent these t ypes of mistakes from happening in the future .’95 According to Google, its  algorithms will get better at categori sing photos if more people correct mistaken tags. The system can  thus be ‘trained’ not to show tag suggestions which almost everyone would consi der racist.96     Machine learning depends on data that has been collected from society. Goodman and Flaxman (2016)  explain that to the extent that society contains inequality, exclusion or other traces of discrimination, so  too will the data. Moreover, machi ne learning will reproduce discriminatory patterns in the ‘training’ data   set. As a consequence, ‘unthinking reliance on data mining can deny members of vulnerable groups full  participation in society ’ (Barocas & Selbst 2016, 671). Goodman and Flaxman (201 6, 3) warn that  ‘biased decisions are presented as the outcome of an objective algorithm ’.     A specific subset of automated decisions is profiling techniques. These have been used , for instance , to  assess how rich a website user is, so prices on the websit e can automatically be adjusted.97 Goodman  and Flaxman (2016, 3) hold that the use of algorithmic profiling for the allocation of resources is  inherently discriminatory, since ‘profiling takes place when data subjects are grouped in categories  according to various variables, and decisions are made on the basis of subjects falling within so -defined  groups ’.     Current data protection regulations only partly address the issues   To what extent may a user seek redress if an automated decision interferes with his o r her rights? Article  15 of the General Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the so -called ‘Kafka provision ’, prohibits certain  fully automated decisions with far -reaching effects, which are not only ‘legal effects’ but also decisions  that ‘significantly af fect a person’ . Moreover, in 1992 the European Commission said that ‘data  processing may provide an aid to decision -making, but it cannot be the end of the matter; human      92 Article 7 UN Declaration of Human rights: ‘All are equal before the law and are entitled without a ny discrimination to equal protection of the law.’ See  also article 21 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .  93 Fortune, ‘SAP Is Building Bias Filters Into Its HR Software’, 31 August 2016, fortune.com/2016/08/31/sap -successfactors -bias-filter/.  94 USA Today, ‘Virtual reality tested by NFL as tool to confront racism, sexism’, 10 April 2016, www.usatoday.com/story/tech/n ews/2016/04/08/virtual reality -tested -tool-confront -racism -sexism/82674406/ .   95 The Wall Street Journal, ‘Google mistakenly tags black people as “gorillas,” showing limits of algorithms’, 1 July 2015,  blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/01/google -mistakenly -tags-black -people -as-gorillas -showing -limits -of-algorithms/.   96 The Wall Street Journal, ‘Google mistakenly tags black people as “gorillas,” showing limits of algorithms’, 1 July 2015,  blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/01/google -mistakenly -tags-black -people -as-gorillas-showing -limits -of-algorithms/.   97 In 2012, it was reported that the website Orbitz showed Apple users a different (more expensive) offer than non -Apple users.

 41  judgment must have its place ’ (Zuiderveen Borgesius 2014, 373). To safeguard the data subject's rights  and freedoms , he or she has a right to obtain human intervention  on the part of the controller, to express  his or her point of view and to contest the decision. However, it is very hard and often even impossible  for people to notice that t hey are excluded from seeing a certain advertisement online or have to pay a  higher price because of  e.g. a softbot equipped with AI identifying him or her as a ‘rich’ person. This  makes it difficult to challenge the automated decision .     It can also be di fficult to determine whether social sorting by automated tools qualifies  as unlawful  discrimination . An inves tigation by ProPublica illustrates this. ProPublica concluded  that in the US certain  insurers were charging premiums that were much higher in areas  where most residents have an ethnic  minority background  than in non -minority neighbourhoods with similar accident costs (Angwin et al.  2017).  As the investigators note, efforts to investigate such redlining  in the car insurance industry were   hindered  during the past few years by  the industry’s refusal to make crucial data available. The  Insurance Information Institute contested ProPublica’s  findings, stating that  insurance companies do not  collect data revealing the racial or ethnic origin of their potenti al customers  and that insurers  do not  discriminate on the basis of race.98 As to the question of why some insurers treat minority  neighbo urhoods differently, the investigators did not rule out that the proprietary algorithms used by  insurers may inadvertent ly favo ur white neighbourhoods over those in which most residents had an  ethnic minority background  (Angwin et al. 2017).  Given these  factors – the lack of crucial data and the  lack of transparency about the algorithms’ inner workings – it can be hard for an individual to  demonst rate unlawful social sorting such as discriminatory practices.     Article 15 of the Directive 95/46/EC does not help to reduce filter bubbles and manipulation risks  much  either , since these activities might not significantly affect a  person in the sense of this article. Based on  the EU regulations, the controlling party that processes the data should inform the ‘profiled’ person of the  logic involved in the processing upon request. However, data protection regulations usually do not a pply  when people are not (in)directly identified. The successor of the Directive 95/46/EC – the GDPR – does  not provide a feasible ‘right to explanation’ either to help individuals to understand easily whether or not  algorithms or otherwise automated tools  discriminate against them (Wachter et al. 2017).      Because of the above -mentioned shortcomings, various legal scholars want , among other things,  to  strengthen the position of the person being profiled. Hildebrandt (2012) calls for transparency -enhancing  technologies, which would enab le meaningful profiling  transparency .     Recommendation   In order to combat algorithmic discrimination , the notion of algorithmic accountability  – in addition to the  current ‘right to explanation’ – is worth consider ing. In pract ice, this would imply things such as  properly  dealing with bias in data sets, discrimination -aware data mining, meaningful transparency in relation to  algorithms and profiling, restriction of the contexts in which such AI is used and demanding outputs that   avoid disparate impacts (cf. Pasquale 2016). It is recommended that the Council of Europe sheds lights  on these issues. First of all, how can existing regulations or new ones facilitate algorithmic accountability  or fairness? Secondly, how can the develop ers of algorithms be enabled to devise automated decisions  that respect human rights and will not (unintentionally) discriminate against some people ?        98 Angwin et al. 2017.

 42  3.8 Access to justice and the right to a fair trial   Access to justice and the right to a fair trial   Article 6 (2) ECHR plays an important role with regard to predictive AI . This provision mandates that  everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to  law.99 Topics such as predictive policing and other predictive t echniques have already been covered by  the Council of Europe (cf. Korff and Georges 2015) and fall outside the scope of this report.     Because algorithms may result in biased decisions, this subsection focuses on the impartiality condition  of article 6(1) ECHR. The first sentence of article 6(1) ECHR stipulates that ‘in the determination of his  civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public  hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law ’.     Artificial Intelligence   Courts are increasingly using tools that automate their decision processes. Softbots  promise to make  legal decisions faster and more consistent ly than human s can  and drastically reduce the l ength of court  proceedings (Winkels 2011). Another promise is that AI can help litigants to assess their case and  estimate their chances  of winning or losing . Since people would then have a better understanding of their  legal chances, it is expected that p eople will go to court less (ibid.). The use of automated tools by judges  may also  help to  ensure a fair trial.     Van den Hoogen (2007) argues that using decisions reached by computers should be possible in  uncomplicated cases, while respecting article 6 E CHR at the same time (Van den Hoogen 2007).  However, several principles should be taken into account when judges use an automated tool to aid the  decision -making process. The principles are aimed at maintaining accountability  because  ‘the judge is  responsi ble for the final decision, also if this decision has been reached with or by assistive [computer]  systems’ (ibid., 12). Other principles are aimed at transparency and recognisability: ‘ [I]f the judge  deviates from the advice of the [computer] system, then  it has to take note of this’ (ibid., 12 -13). The  assisting systems may indeed operate in favour of the safeguards as provided by article 6(1) ECHR.  Especially in uncomplicated cases, these systems can aid a trial, for example by speeding up the  proceeding s.    On the other hand , the ICT systems could act in breach of the impartiality principle when the AI is biased.  In that case, human rights are challenged. The increased use of risk -assessing algorithms in the  American justice system raises accountability a nd transparency issues.100 It has been reported that  software used to set bail , conditions for parole  and sentencing decisions is biased against Afr ican  Americans (Angwin et al. 2016), although the real impact of the software might not be that clear.101 With  regard to AI agents used by police forces that lead to criminal proceedings, Hildebrandt (2016) notes that  we have to become resistant to the notion that the outcomes of using an AI tool are necessarily correct,  complete or even relevant with regard to pote ntial suspects. According to Hildebrandt, the ‘equality of  arms’ principle of article 6 ECHR should be reinvented the moment that the public prosecutor, the judge  or the lawyer are unable to check how the police ’s AI agent reached its conclusions. Such AI agents  should log what they did, for what purpose and how they reached the outcome.         99 See also article 11 UN Declaration of Human Rights and article 47 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .  100 M.

 43  Recommendation   Comparable to the observations made in subsections 3.6 and 3.7 regarding automated decisions,  transparency about the AI tools used in relation to court pro ceedings and the accountability (of the judge)  is essential. As part of a fair trial it should be known that e.g. an AI equipped softbot aiding the judge is  being used and how this tool affects the decisions reached. The Council of Europe could establish a   framework of minimum norms to be taken into account when a court uses AI. This could prevent as far as  possible situations in which  individual contracting states devise their own frameworks , which  risks  offering varying degrees of protection in the sense of what is set out in article 6 ECHR.     3.9 Two potential novel human rights   To keep the robot age human -friendly, we propose two potential ‘novel’ human rights: 1) the right to not  be measured , analysed or coached, and 2) the right to meaningful human contact.  These two novel  rights are indirectly related to, and aim to elaborate  on, in the context of the robot age , existing human  rights, such as,  respectively, the classic privacy right to be let alone and the right to respect for family life,  that is , the righ t to establish and develop relationships with other human beings.     3.9.1  Right to not be measured, analysed or coached   States organi se population census es and install cameras because they rely on information to draft, apply  and evaluate their policies. Scott (19 99) even observes that states seem to have a natural tendency to  make their citizens ‘readable’ and societies ‘searchable’ (Scott 1999). Besides governments, companies,  such as Google, Apple and Facebook, also gather information about people , although most ly for  commercial purposes. Driven by the Internet and the Internet of Things , profiling by companies (Christl &  Spiekermann 2016) and state actors (WRR 2016b) has become more and more commonplace. Since  many technologies nowadays can operate from a distan ce, most of us are not even aware of the mass  surveillance taking place by state and market actors. This creeping development as a whole, and its  impact on human rights and society, has received little attention and there has been scarcely any  fundamental political and public debate so far.     As a result , human beings are rather defenceless relative to this mass surveillance culture, since there  are few opportunities  to escape the surveillance activities if one does not want to be measured, analysed  or coach ed (as part of a persuasive strategy). For instance, researchers from Georgetown University  published evidence showing that half of all American adults, including innocent ones, are in a police face recognition database as part of a ‘perpetual line -up’ (Garvie et al.  2016). To give another example, in  response to worries by consumers about Wi -Fi tracking by shop owners, the former Dutch minister of  economic affairs and the state secretary of security and justice stated that people should just turn off  their smartphone if they do not want to be tracked.102 On the basis of  this response , it seems that  tracking and tracing people is a right which is deemed more important than peoples’ (privacy) rights. Until  recently, people could turn off their PC if they did no t want to be tracked online. In our onlife world this  strategy has become outdated. There has been little debate about the accumulative effect of mass  surveillance. Instead, triggered by specific applications and incidents, ‘mini debates’ about a certain t opic  have been organised, and the outcome of each debate is a balancing act that mostly favours national  security or economic interests. The sum of the debates, however, is the gradual but steady dissolving of  privacy and anonymity for the individual.     Some authors have stressed certain detrimental effects of ubiquitous monitoring, profiling or scoring  (Citron & Pasquale 2014) and persuasion. Strand and Kaiser (2015, 6) note that ‘the right to privacy and      102 Tweakers, ‘Kabinet: zet telefoon uit om wifi -tracking tegen te gaan’, 1 2 February 2014, https://tweakers.net/nieuws/94273/kabinet -zet-telefoon -uit-omwifi-tracking -tegen -te-gaan.html  (Dutch) . 
 44  the possibility to perform everyday undertakings wit hout being seen, monitored or noticed, may be  fundamental to the development of a sane personality ’. Rapporteur for the Council of Europe Douwe  Korff stresse s that ‘profiling poses a fundamental threat to the most basic principles of the Rule of Law  and th e relationship between the powerful and the people in a democratic society ’ (Korff 2013, 7 ;  Georges & Korff 2015, 32). The Berlin Telecom Group (2013) considers large -scale monitoring and  profiling activities as an unprecedented risk to the privacy of all citizens. As a worst -case scenario , the  world could turn into a ‘global panopticon ’ (Berlin Telecom Group 2013). The Group states that  governments have largely turned a blind eye to these alarming developments, leaving them to self regulatory activities. W hat is at stake here is not only the risk of abuse but the right to remain anonymous  and/or the ‘right to be let alone’ (Warren & Brandeis 1890), which in the robot age could be phrased as  the right to not be electronically measured, analysed or coached.     So far, the right to online  anonymity  has received  limited recognition under international law (Article 19  2015, 11). With the fast advent of the IoT and the Internet of Robotic Things, we recommend that the  Council of Europe recogni ses the right to onlife anonymity  as an independent right or as a clarified right  linked to existing privacy rights. People should have the right to decide whether or not they want to  participate in experiments carried out by other actors (which usually goes hand in hand with s urveillance)  or other activities that involve registering or otherwise observing people’s lives and influencing their  behaviour with technological means.     Recommendation   The Council of Europe could clarify to what extent in the context of the robot age the  right to respect for  privacy implies the right to not be measured , analysed or coached.     3.9.2  Right to meaningful human contact   Sometimes, robots may be able to completely take over a set of human tasks  – think of so -called lights out factories, which are full y automated and require no human presence or decision -making onsite. In  these kinds of cases , we accept that people get out of the loop. In many other contexts, however, we  would like to keep human beings in and on the loop. As a response to the developmen t of autonomous  military drones, hundreds of scientists and experts proposed a ban on offensive autonomous weapons  beyond ‘meaningful human control’ .103 This concept of meaningful human control is also relevant to other  areas in which autonomous or AI system s potentially make critical decisions (AI Now Report 2016). In  the case of AI and judges , meaningful human control is also an important theme. In contexts where  human contact and interaction plays a central role, such as  raising children and caring for eld erly people,  the ‘right to meaningful human contact’ could play a role  too.     On the personal level, a right to meaningful human contact could safeguard one’s well -being and prevent  social and emotional deskilling. In the context of human imprisonment , it has been recogni sed that  modern technology should facilitate and not replace  human contact.104 In her book on solitary  confinement, Shalev (2008) argues that when an individual is removed from the company of other  people, then this solitary confinement depri ves him or her of most forms of meaningful and sympathetic  social interaction, as well as physical contact. Also , with respect to health care for the elderly, it is  claimed that the absence of human contact affects the physical and psychological well -being  of the  elderly. Some researchers believe that contact with care robots cannot compensate for the lack of  human contact (cf. Sharkey & Sharkey 2012). Coeckelberg (2010) claims that robots should only be  used instrumentally for routine care jobs, and that c are-giving tasks that require emotional, intimate and      103 Future of Life, ‘Open Letter on Autonomous Weapons - Future of Life Institute’, 28 July 2015, futureoflife.org/open -letter -autonomous -weapons/.   104 Ambassador Torbjørn Frøysnes, Head of the Council of Europe Office to the EU, opening speech at the 18th Conference of Directors of Prison  Administration, 22 November 2013.  
 45  personal involvement should be done by  people. From a societal point of view , it is argued that caring for  other people is a key characteristic and responsibility of human beings and our human culture. As  Tufekci  puts it: ‘[W]e cannot outsource our responsibilities to machines. ’105     The European Parliament’s JURI  Committee considers  that human contact is one of the fundamental  aspects of human care and it believes that replacing the human factor with robo ts could dehumanise  caring practices (JURI  Committee 2017). We consider that these dehumanising  practices may also occur  outside the field of human care. Therefore, we recommend that the Council of Europe clarif ies in what  contexts and to what extent peopl e have the right to meaningful human contact.     Recommendation   The Council of Europe could clarify to what extent in the context of the robot age the right to respect for  family life should also include the right to meaningful human contact.       105 Zeynep Tufekci, ‘Machine intelligence makes human morals more important’, June 2016,  https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_can_t_control_what_our_intelligent_machines_are_learning.  
 46  4 Safeguarding hu man rights in the  robot age   Digital technologies affect human rights in numerous ways   This report studied the relationship between the engineering megatrend ‘technology is becoming more  and more biology’ and human rights. The set of digital technologies we  have examined ranges from the  Internet and big data to AI, robotics and augmented reality, and is often referred to as the Internet of  (Robotic) Things. We investigated six specific applications: self -driving cars, care robots, e -coaches, AI  that is used for social sorting, judicial applications of AI , and virtual and augmented reality.     We found that these technologies provide new means through which human rights can be exercised as  well as violated. Besides affecting the right to respect for private lif e in numerous ways, digiti sation,  virtuali sation and roboti sation influence human dignity, the right to the peaceful enjoyment of  possessions, safety and tort rights, the right to freedom of expression, the prohibition of discrimination,  access to justice and the right to a fair trial. It is important to note that other human rights issues may well  arise due to the use of intelligent artefacts that fall outside the scope of this report.     Lack of attention to the  erosion of human rights   Despite this wide -ranging impact of digital technologies on human rights, so far little attention  has been  paid to  this crucial topic and there has been scarcely any fundamental political and public debate on it.  As a result , a serious erosion of human rights is taking place. Therefore, the human rights debate, which  is seriously lagging behind the fast -growing  technological developments, needs to be strengthened  rapidly. We agree with the analysis of and share the  concern of Donahoe (2016) , who states that  ‘[an]  understanding of how to protect human rights in the digital context is significantly underdeveloped. As we  stumble along and try to adjust to our new digital reality, the relevance and predominance of the  international human rights framework could lose salience in the i nternational geo -political arena.’     Time for a wake -up call by PACE   In the context of human rights in the robot age, a wake -up call by the Parliamentary Assembly of the  Council of Europe (PACE) would be very welcome. Triggered by many developments in the f ield of  human genetics, PACE called for the preparation of a convention on bioethics in the early 1990s. In 1997  this led to the Oviedo Convention, which created guiding principles – such as  the protection of private  life, respect for autonomy, the right t o information and informed consent – to preserve human dignity in  the way humans apply innovations in biomedicine. In article 2, the Oviedo Convention clarifies that the  interests of the individual have priority over the sole interests of science or societ y. Guided by the  principle of the primacy of the human being,106 the general interest only has priority in very precise  situations and subject to strict conditions.107 Also, with respect to , for example , privacy rights, a balance  is sought between individual p rivacy rights on the one hand and the interests of ‘national security, public  safety or a country’s economic wellbeing’ on the other hand.108 However, in the current context , human  rights and interests of individuals lose out most of the time, especially wit h regard to policy making, and      106 Council of Europe, Expla natory Report to the Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the  Application of Biology and Medicine: Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, European Treaty Series – No. 164, paragraphs 21 and 22.   107 As defined in article 26 of the Oviedo Convention, see: Council of Europe, Explanatory Report to the Convention for the prote ction of Human Rights  and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine: Convention on Human Ri ghts and Biomedicine, European Treaty  Series – No. 164, paragraph 14.   108 As mentioned in article 8(2) ECHR.  
 47  thus over time become eroded. This does not have to be a fait accompli . The Oviedo Convention shows  that it is possible that the ‘default setting’ for striking a balance between individual and general interests  can be set in favour of the individual’s interests – the sum of which are, in fact, collective interests.     So far , the bulk of the bioethical debate and related human rights treaties have focused on the  engineering megatrend ‘human biology is becoming technology’ . In other words, the focus has been  on  invasive biomedical technologies that work inside the body, or ‘technologies within us’ . This report p aid  special attention to the ‘technology is becoming biology’ trend and shows that in this robot age humans  and digital technologies have become intimately entangled in many different ways. This is a process in  which technology is nestling itself within us and between us  more and more; it  increasingly compiles  information about us and is progressively able to act just like us (Van Est 2014). As we have shown,  these non -invasive intimate digital technologies can have many bioethical implications and impact human  rights in many ways. In an analogy with the activities of the Council of Europe in the 1990s in the field of  biomed ical technologies and human rights , we have produced  the following main recommendation:     Main recommendation: Need for Convention on human rights in the robot age   In order to safeguard human rights in the robot age, we recommend th at PACE call s for the pre paration  of a convention on robot  ethics, or , even better, safeguarding human rights in the robot age, which would  create common guiding principles to preserve human dignity in the way humans apply innovations in the  field of the Internet of Things, includ ing the Internet, robotics, AI, and virtual and augmented reality.     Input for an initial agenda   In chapter 3 we recommended that the Council of Europe form s opinions on various topics. Box 4.1  summari ses this list of recommendations. This list may also fun ction as an initial agenda for the  preparation of a convention on robot  ethics.     Box 4.1  List of recommendations     Right to the protection of personal data (see subsection 3.2.1)   We recommend that the Council of Europe take s a stance with regard to the ubi quitous and  massive personal data processing of the modern era, reinforcing the human rights principles as  enshrined in the Conventions.     Right to respect for private life (see subsection 3.2.2)   The Council of Europe could form an opinion about the psychol ogical experiments involving  humans taking place on the Internet and could clarify whether the firms that are doing the se  psychological experiments on the Internet should follow the ethics codes that currently apply when   doing psychological experiments. Th e Council of Europe could form an opinion on whether and how  persuasion software can be developed that respects people’s agency.     Right to respect for family life (see subsection 3.2.3)   The Council of Europe could form an opinion about how ICTs can be desi gned in such a way that  they comply with the right to respect for family life.     Human dignity (see subsection 3.3)   The Council of Europe could provide guidelines on engineering techniques and methods that permit  AI and robotics to fully respect the indivi dual’s dignity and rights, allowing vulnerable groups such as  the elderly to fully and effectively participate in society and live their lives in dignity.  
 48    The right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see subsection 3.4)   The Council of Europe could provide guidance on ownership matters in the robot age, setting the  boundaries within which someone may enjoy his or her (in)tangible possessions and how others  have to respect those boundaries.     Safety, responsibility and liability (see subsection 3.5)   The Council of Europe could offer guidelines on how to apportion  liability with regard to robotics.     The right to freedom of expression (see subsection 3.6)   The Council of Europe could provide clarification on the role of information gatekeepers , such as  Google and Facebook , as news editor s and their possible duties as public watchdog s. In addition,  the Council of Europe could provide a blueprint as to how central information gatekeepers, such as   Google and Facebook, could use their algorithmic powers for the benefit of human rights, especially  in relation to the right to receive and impart information and ideas.     The prohibition of discrimination (see subsection 3.7)   The Council of Europe could shed light on how algorithmic accountability or fairness can be  facilitated and how the developers of algorithms can be enabled to devise automated decisions that  respect human rights and will not (unintentionally) discriminate  against individuals .    Access to justice and the right to a fair trial (see subsection 3.8)   The Council of Europe could establish a framework of minimum norms to be taken into account  when a court uses AI. This could prevent as far as possible situations in which  individual contracting  states devise their own frameworks , which  risks offering varyin g degrees of protection in the sense  of what is set out in article 6 ECHR.     The right to not be measured , analysed or coached (see subsection 3.9.1)   The Council of Europe could clarify to what extent in the context of the robot age the right to respect  for privacy implies the right to not be measured , analysed or coached.     The right to meaningful human contact (see subsection 3.9.2)   The Council of Europe could clarify to what extent in the context of the robot age the right to respect  for family life should  also include the right to meaningful human contact.

Who was Rathenau? The Rathenau Instituut is named after Professor G.W. Rathenau (1911-1989), who  was successively professor of experimental physics at the University of Amsterdam,  director of the Philips Physics Laboratory in Eindhoven, and a member of the  Scientific Advisory Council on Government Policy. He achieved national fame as chairman of the commission formed in 1978 to investigate the societal implications  of micro-electronics. One of the commission's recommendations was that there  should be ongoing and systematic monitoring of the societal significance of all tech nological advances. Rathenau's activities led to the foundation of the Netherlands  Organization for Technology Assessment (NOTA) in 1986. In 1994 this organization  was renamed 'the Rathenau Instituut'.
