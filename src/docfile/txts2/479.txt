  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     5    Introduction    #AIforAll: Technology Leadership for Inclusive Growth     Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to disrupt our world. With intelligent machines enabling high -level  cognitive processes like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making, coupled  with advances in data collection and aggregation, analytics and compute r processing power, AI presents  opportunities to complement and supplement human intelligence and enrich the way people live and  work.   India, being the fastest growing economy with the second largest population in the world, has a significant  stake in the AI revolution. Recognising AI’s potential to transform economies and the need for India to  strategise its approach, Hon’ble Finance Minister, in his budget speech  for 2018 – 2019 , mandated NITI  Aayog to establish the National Program on AI , with a view to guiding the research and development in  new and emerging technologies. In pursuance of the above, NITI Aayog has ad opted a three -pronged  approach – undertaking exploratory proof -of-concept AI projects in various areas, crafting a national  strategy for buil ding a vibrant AI ecosystem in India and collaborating with various experts and  stakeholders. Since the start of this year, NITI Aayog has partnered with several leading AI technology  players to implement AI projects in critical areas such as agriculture a nd health. Learnings from these  projects, under various stages of implementation, as well as our engagement with some of the leading  institutions and experts have given a better perspective to our task of crafting the national strategy for AI ,  which is the  focus of this discussion paper.   This strategy document is premised on the proposition that India, given its strengths and characteristics,  has the potential to position itself among leader s on the global AI map – with a  unique brand of #AIforAll .  The appr oach in this paper focuses on how India can leverage the transformative technologies to ensure  social and inclusive growth in line with the development philosophy of the government. In addition, India  should  strive to replicate these solutions in other sim ilarly placed developing countries .   #AIforAll will aim at enhancing and empowering human capabilities to address the challenges of access,  affordability, shortage and inconsistency of skilled expertise; effective implementation of AI initiatives to  evolve  scalable s olutions for emerging economies;  and endeavors to tackle some of the global challenges  from AI’s perspective, be it application, research, development,  technology, or responsible AI. #AIforAll  will focus on harnessing collaborations and partners hips, and aspires to ensure prosperity for all. Thus,  #AIforAll means technology leadership in AI for achieving the greater good.   While evolving the national strategy for AI, the underlying thrust was to identify applications with maximum  social impact,  a willingness to learn from the best of the world when it comes to the recen t technology  advancements in AI,  and leveraging approaches that democrati ze access to and further development of  AI.  From an applications perspective, the approach is to identify sec tors that may have the potential of  greatest externalities while adopting AI solutions, and hence require the government to play a leading  role in developing the implementation roadmap for AI. For example, the agriculture sector in India, which  forms the b edrock of India’s economy, needs multi -layered technology infusion and coordination amongst  several stakeholders. Efforts from private sector may neither be financially optimal nor efficient on a  standalone basis, and hence  sustained government interventio n to tackle the existing challenges  and  constraints  is needed . Hence, India’s approach to implementation of AI has to be guided by optimi sation  of social goods, rather than maximis ation of topline growth.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     6    From a technology perspective, the strategy is to maximi se the late -movers’ advantage. Acknowledging  that India is some distance away from consistently delivering home grown pioneering technology  solutions in AI, adapting and innovating the technology for India’s unique needs and opportunities would  help it in leap frogging, while simultaneously building the foundational R&D capability aimed at ensuring  competitiveness in the long run.   Solving for India, given the complexity and multi -dimensional aspects of most of our economic and  societal challenges, can  easily be extended to the rest of the emerging and developing economies. An  integral part of India’s strategy for AI involves tackling common and complex global challenges that can  be solved through technology intervention, and India’s scale and opportuni ty landscape provides the ideal  test-bed to ensure sustainable and scalable solutions .  The purpose of this paper is to lay the ground work for evolv ing the National Strategy for Artificial  Intelligence . While this paper includes several recommendations, so me of which may be deemed  disruptive, specifics (e.g. execution and financial implications) have been consciously avoided, since  wider consultations and consensus building is needed to refine these recommendations. This document  is intended to serve as an “essential pre -read” in building a truly transformative approach in pursuit of  #AIforAll.       Amitabh Kant   CEO, NITI Aayog      
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     7    Executive S ummary    India’s Approach to L eadership in AI     AI refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem  solving and decision making. Initially conceived as a technology that could mimic human intelligence, AI  has evolved in ways that far exceed its orig inal conception. With incredible advances made in data  collection, processing and computation power, intelligent systems can now be deployed to take over a  variety of tasks, enable connectivity and enhance productivity. As AI’s capabilities have dramatical ly  expanded, so have  its utility in a growing number of fields.   The truly transformative nature of the technology, yet the nascent stage of its adoption worldwide,  provides India with an opportunity to define its own brand of AI leadership. #AIforAll - the brand proposed  for India implies inclusive technology leadership, where the full potential of AI is reali sed in pursuance of  the country’s unique needs and aspirations. The strategy should strive to leverage AI for economic  growth, social development and inclusive growth, and finally as a “Garage” for emerging and developing  economies.   While AI has the potential to provide large incremental value to a wide range of sectors, adoption till date  has been driven primarily from a commercial perspective . Technol ogy disruptions like AI are once -in-ageneration phenomenon, and hence large -scale  adoption strategies, especially national strategies, need  to strike a balance between narrow definitions of financial impact and the greater good. NITI Aayog has  decided to focus on five sectors that are envisioned to benefit the most from AI in solving societal needs :  a) Healthcare: increased access and affo rdability of quality healthcare,   b) Agriculture: enhanced farmers’ income, increased farm produc tivity and reduction of wasta ge,  c) Education: improved access and quality of education,   d) Smart Cities and Infrastructure: efficient and connectivity for the burgeoning urban population,   and  e) Smart Mobility and Transportation: smarter and safer modes of transportation and better traffic  and congestion problems.   To truly reap the benefits of deploying AI at scale, the report identifies the following barriers that need to  be addressed in order to achieve the goals of #AIforAll:   a) Lack of broad based expertise in research and application of AI,   b) Absence of enabling data ecosystems – access to intelligen t data,   c) High resource cost and l ow awareness for adoption of AI,   d) Privacy and security, including a lack of formal regulatio ns around anonymis ation of data,  and  e) Absence of collaborative approach to adoption and application of AI.   Superior research capabilities have  been the cornerstone of leadership aspirations in emerging  technologies and effectively realis ing the growth potential requires expertise in both core and applied  research. Despite indicat ions of recent positive efforts in this aspect of technology, AI research in India  is still in its infancy and requires large scale concerted and collaborative interventions .   The paper proposes a two -tiered structure to address India’s AI research aspirat ions:   a) Centre  of Research Excellence (CORE)  focused on developing better understanding of existing  core research and pushing technology frontiers through creation of new knowledge;  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     8    b) International Centers of Transformational AI (ICTAI)  with a mandate of developing and deploying  application -based research. Private sector collaboration is envisioned to be a key aspect of  ICTAIs.   The research capabilities are proposed to be com plemented by an umbrella organis ation responsible for  providing  direction to research efforts through analysis of socio -economic indicators, studying global  advancements, and encouraging international collaboration. Pursuing “ moonshot research projects ”  through speciali sed teams, development of a dedicated supranation al agency to channel research in  solving big, audacious  problems of AI – “CERN for AI”, and developing common computing and other  related infrastructure for AI are other key components research suggested .   As technology increasingly disrupts the nature of jobs and shifts the benchmarks of technological  aptitude, skilling and reskilling of workforce forms an integral part of our approach to adopting AI. There  is an emergent need for reskilling the existing workforce and developing future talent in accordance  with  the changing needs of the job market. This could be done via the adoption of decentrali sed teaching  mechanisms working in collaboration with the private sector and educational institutions to prescribe  certification with value. Furthermore, promotion  of job creation in new areas, like data annotation needs  to be identified and promoted, as these would have the potential of absorbing a large portion of the  workforce that may find itself redundant due to increasing automation.   Adoption of AI across the  value chain viz. startups, private sector, PSUs and government entities, will  truly unlock the potential by creating a virtuous cycle of supply and demand. The barriers to AI  development and deployment can effectively be addressed by adopting the marketpl ace model – one  that enables market discovery of not only the price but also of different approaches that are best suited  to achieve the desired results. A three -pronged, formal marketplace could be created focusing on data  collection and aggregation, data annotation  and deployable models. There could be a common platform  called the National AI Marketplace (NAIM).   Furthermore, for accelerated adoption of a highly collaborative technology like AI, the government has to  play the critical role of a catalyst in supporting  partnerships, providing access to infrastructure, fostering  innovation through research and creating the demand by seeking solutions for addressing various  governmental  needs .  As AI -based solutions permeate the way we live and do business, questions on et hics, privacy and  security  will also emerge . Most discussions on ethical considerations of AI are a derivation of the FAT  framework (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency). A consortium of Ethics Councils at each Centre   of Research Excellence can be se t up and it would be expected that all COREs adhere to standard  practice while developing AI technology and products.   Data is one of the primary drivers of AI solutions, and thus appropriate handling of data, ensuring privacy  and security is of prime impor tance. Challenges include data usage without consent, risk of identification  of individuals through data, data selection bias and the resulting discrimination of AI models, and  asymmetry in data aggregation. The paper suggests establishing data protection frameworks and  sectorial regulatory frameworks, and promotion of adopti on of international standards.   In order for India to ride the AI innovation wave, a robust intellectual property framework is required.  Despite a number of government initiatives in st rengthening the IP regime, challenges remain, especially  in respect of applying stringent and narrowly focused patent laws to AI applications – given the unique  nature of AI solution development. The importance of data to development of useful models is on e such  example. To tackle these issues, establishment of IP facilitation centers to help bridge the gap between  practitioners and AI developers, and adequate training of IP granting authorities, judiciary and tribunals  is suggested.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     9    The AI strategy is aime d at primarily guiding an inevitable wave of change for quicker and better impact.  The AI ecosystem is rapidly evolving and taking societies into uncharted territory. For now, we can begin  to ask some of the big questions that each society must answer for itself: are we ready to manage data  ethically? How do we bridge the digital divide? Which innovations are worthy of public funds and  partnerships? Bringing these questions into the open is the most important step in ensuring that AI  advances create a bette r society.   There has been tremendous activity concerning AI policy in different countries over the past couple of  years. Governments in USA, UK, France, Japan and China have released their policy and strategy papers  relating to AI. In order to establish a leadership role, it is important for India to take the plunge and start  by releasing a Strategy Paper to initiate the roll out of an ambitious programme that would ensure for  India its rightful place in this transformational era.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     12        What is Artificial Intelligence?    A technical primer     AI might just be the single largest technology revolution of our live times, with the potential to disrupt  almost all aspects of human existence. Andrew Ng, Co -founder of Coursera and formerly head of Baidu  AI Group  / Google Brain, compares the transformational impact of AI to that of electr icity 100 years back.  With many industries aggressively investing in cognitive and AI solutions, global investments are forecast  to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50 .1% to reach USD 57.6 billion in 20211.  AI is not a new phenomenon, with mu ch of its theoretical and technological underpinning developed over  the past 70 years by computer scientists such as Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. AI has  already existed to some degree in many industries and governments. Now, thanks to virt ually unlimited  computing power and the decreasing costs of data storage, we are on the cusp of the exponential age of  AI as organis ations learn to unlock the value trapped in vast volumes of data.   AI is a constellation of technologies that enable machines  to act with higher levels of intelligence and  emulate the human capabilities of sense, comprehend and act. Thus, comput er vision and audio  processing can actively perceive the world around them by acquiring and processing images, sound and  speech. The nat ural language processing and inference engines can enable AI systems to analy se and  understand the information collected. An AI system can also take action through technologies such as  expert systems and inference engines or  undertak e actions in the physical world . These  human  capabilities are augmented  by the ability to learn from experience and keep adapt ing over time. AI  systems are finding ever -wider application to supplement these capabilities across enterprises as they  grow in sophistication.   Irrespective of the type of AI being used, however, every application begins with large amounts of training  data. In the past, this kind of performance was driven by rules -based data analytics programs, statistical  regressions, and early “expert systems.” Bu t the explosion of powerful de ep neural networks now gives  AI something a mere program doesn’t have: the ability to do the unexpected.                                                             1 Worldwide Semi -annual Cognitive Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide from International Data Corp. (IDC), 2017  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     13    Figure 1: What is Artificial Intelligence       AI technology has experienced a checkered history of waves of optimism followed by disappointment and   periods of inertia, dubbed as “ AI winters ”. Each previous breakthrough has only ever partly lived up to  the hype it generated, and none has managed to kick -start the technology into the mainstream .  Figure 2:  Evolution of AI       The big change today is that we are  in an unprecedented period of technology innovation across so many  different fields tha t gives us the belief that the “ AI Spring ” has not only arrived but is here to stay. Key  developments responsible for this optimism are :  Source:   Accenture   Source:   Accenture  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     14    a) Unlimited access to computing power : The worldwide public cloud services market is projected  to grow 21.4% in 2018 to total USD186.4 billion, up from USD153.5 bi llion in 2017, according to  Gartner, Inc. The access is amplified by rapid increase in computational power.    b) Huge fall in cost of storing data : We are in an age where the hard drive cost per gigabyte of data  has been falling exponentially, to the extent th at we are approaching near zero marginal cost for  storin g data (down from USD500,000  a gigabyte in 1980 to 2 cents a gigabyte in 2017).   c) Explosion in data that is digiti sed: As per IDC forecasts,  by 2025 , the global data sphere will grow  to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes)2, or ten times the 16.1ZB of data generated in 2016.  As Barry Smyth, Professor of Computer science at University College Dublin, says: "Data is to  AI what food is to humans. " So, in a more digital world, the exponential growth of data is  constantly feeding AI improvements .  Consider, for example, the vastly increased processing power that comes from using Graphics  Processing Units (GPUs) in place of Central Processing Units (CPUs). Google , in May 2017 ,  announced that its  Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) delivered  higher performance -per-watt than  contemporary CPUs and GPUs3. When you add the decreasing cost of storage to the mix, plus the  exponential growth in data volumes, together with the emergence of open source platforms and  frameworks, you have got a uniquely potent combination of tech nologies and capabilities. It all adds  up to a very powerful foundation to give AI its critical mass for mainstream adoption .  Box 1: Machine Learning and Deep Learning   Machine Learning, a term coined by Artur Samuel in 1959, meant “the ability to learn wit hout being  explicitly programmed.” Machine Learning involves the use of algorithms to parse data and learn from it,  and making a determination or prediction as a result. Instead of hand coding software libraries with well defined specific instructions for a particular task, the machine gets “trained” using large amounts of data  and algorithms, and in turn gains the capability to perform specific tasks .  “Deep Learning is a technique for implementing Machine L earning. Deep L earning was inspired by the  structu re and function of the brain, specifically the interconnecting of many neurons. Artificial Neural  Networks (ANNs) are algorithms that are based on the biological structure of  the brain. In ANNs, there  are ‘neurons’  which have discrete layers and connection s to other “neurons”. Each layer picks out a  specific feature to learn. It’s this layering that gives deep learning its name, depth is created by using  multiple layers as opposed to a single layer4.”    Figure 3:  AI, ML and Deep Learning     Source:  nVIDIA                                                          2 Data Age 2025: “The Evolution of Data to Life -Critical whitepaper by International Data Corpor ation, 2017”   3 Google: In -Datacenter Performance Analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit , 2017   4 Medium.com: “The Difference Between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning”   
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     15    For a detailed analysis of major types of Machine Learning, algorithms and use cases, please refer to  Appendix I: Artificial Intelligence Explained .  AI gets categori sed in different ways and it may be useful to understand the various categories, their  rationale and the implications.   a) Weak AI vs. Strong AI : Weak AI describes "simulated" thinking. That is, a system which appears  to behave intelligently, but doesn't have any kind of consciousness about what it's doing. For  example, a chatbot might appear to hol d a natural conversation, but it has no sense of who it is  or why it's talking to you. Strong AI describes "actual" thinking. That is, behaving intelligently,  thinking as human does, with a conscious, subjective mind. For example, when two humans  converse,  they most likely know exactly who they are, what they're doing, and why.   b) Narrow AI vs. General AI : Narrow AI describes an AI that is limited to a single task or a set  number of tasks. For example, the capabilities of IBM's Deep Blue, the chess playing computer  that beat world champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, were limited to playing chess. It wouldn't have  been able to win a game of tic -tac-toe - or even know how to play. General AI describes an AI  which can be used to complete a wide range of tasks in a wide range of environments. As such,  it's much closer to human intelligence.   c) Superintelligence: The term "superintelligence" is often used to refer to general and strong AI at  the point at which it surpasses human intelligence, if it ever does.   While big s trides have been made in Artificial Narrow Intelligence – algorithms that can process  documents, drive vehicles or beat champion chess players, no one has yet claimed the first production  or development of General AI. The weight of expert opinion is that w e are a long way off the emergence  of General AI.   Figure 4: Narrow AI vs. General AI      Source:   Accenture  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     16       Global Developments in Artificial Intelligence   Benchmarking s elect countries     Countries around the world are becoming increasingly aware of the potential economic and social  benefits of developing and applying AI. For example, China and U.K. estimate that 26% and 10% of their  GDPs respectively in 2030 will be sourced from AI -related  activities and businesses. There has been  tremendous activity concerning AI policy positions and the development of an AI ecosystem in different  countries over the last 18 to 24 months – the US published its AI report in December 2016; France  published th e AI strategy in January 2017 followed by a detail ed policy document in March 2018 ; Japan  released a document in March 2017; China published the AI strategy in July 2017; and U.K. released its  industrial strategy in November 2017.   Infrastructural supply s ide interventions have been planned by various countries for creating a larger  ecosystem of AI development. Creation of “data trusts”, rolling out of digital connectivity infrastructure  such as 5G / full fiber networks, common supercomputing facilities, fi scal incentives and creation of open  source software libraries are some of the focus areas of various governments as committed in their  strategy papers.   In the area of core research in AI and related technologies, universities and research institutions fr om the  US, China and Japan have led the publication volume on AI research topics between 2010 and 2016.  Universities in USA, primarily Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and  Stanford, took an early lead in AI research by offe ring new courses, establishing research facilities and  instituting industry partnerships. Off late, Chinese universities, especi ally Peking and Tsinghua  Universities have caught on to the race by utilising large scale public funding and extensive research  partnerships with private companies.   For building the future workforce for AI, countries are also significantly increasing the allocation of  resources for Science, Technology, Engineering and M aths (STEM) talent development through  investment in universit ies, mandating new courses (e.g., AI and law), and offering schemes to retrain  people. For instance, U.K. has planned to build over 1,000 government supported PhD researchers by  2025 and set up a Turing fellowship to support an initial cohort of AI fellows  while China has launched a  five-year university program to train at least 500 teachers and 5,000 students working on AI technologies.   Governance structures for enabling all the above mandates vary across countries. Many countries have  instituted dedicated public offices such as Ministry of AI (UAE), and Office of AI and AI Council (U.K.)  while China and Japan have allowed existing minist ries to take up AI implementation in their sectoral  areas. Not just national governments, but even local city governments have become increasingly aware  about the importance and potential of AI and have committed public investments.   National governments h ave significantly increased public funding for AI through commitments such as  increasing the R&D spend, setting up industrial and investment funds in AI startups, investing in network  and infrastructure and AI -related public procurements. China, USA, Franc e and Japan have committed  significant public spending for AI technology development and adoption.   These countries are also leveraging different combinations of public -private -academia to develop and  promote AI. Development of technology parks, and connec ting large corporations with start ups and 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     17    forming “national teams” with large private players to undertake fundamental and applied research are  some of the public -private partnership approaches various national governments have espoused.   AI technology dev elopment and applications are evolving rapidly with major implications for economies  and societies. A study by EY and NASCCOM found  that by 2022, around 46%  of the workforce will be  engaged in entirely new jobs that do not exist today, or will be deployed in jobs that have radically  changed skillsets5. If some countries decide to wait for a few years to establish an AI strategy and put in  place the foundations for developing the AI ecosystem, it seems unlikely that they would be able to attain  and match up to the current momentum in the rapidly changing socio -economic environment. Therefore,  the need of the hour is to develop a policy framework that will help set up a vibrant AI ecosystem in India.   A detailed study of various country strategies for AI is pl aced in the Appendix II: Global Country Strategy  Review .                                                           5 Future of Jobs in India: A 2022 Perspective, 2017  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     18        Artificial  Intelligence  and India   Identifying priority areas for India’s efforts in Artificial Intelligence     A national AI strategy needs to be premised on a framework which is adapted to India’s unique needs  and aspirations, while at the same time, is capable of achieving the country’s full potential of leveraging  AI developments. Such a framework could be seen as an aggregation of the following three distinct, yet  inter-related components :  a) Opportunity : the economic impact of AI for India   b) AI for Greater Good : social development and inclusive growth   c) AI Garage for 40% of the world : solution provider of choice for the emerging and developing  economies (ex -China) across the globe    Opportunity:  the economic impact of Artificial Intelligence for India   AI is emerging as a new factor of production, augmenting the traditional factors of production viz. labor,  capital and innovation and technological changes captured  in total factor productivity. AI  has the potential to overcome  the physical limitations of capital and labour, and open up  new sources of value and growth. From an economic impact  perspective, AI has the potential to drive growth through  enabling: (a) intelligent automation i.e. ability to automate  complex physical world tasks that require adaptability and  agility across industries, (b) labo ur and capital  augmentation: enabling humans to focus on parts of their  role that add the most value, complementing human  capabilities and improving c apital efficiency, and (c)  innovation diffusion i.e. propelling innovations as it diffuses through the economy. AI innovations in one  sector will have positive consequences in another, as industry sectors are interdependent based on value  chain. Economic v alue is expected to be created from the new goods, services and innovations that AI  will enable.   Accenture, in its recent AI research reports6, provides a framework for evaluating the economic impact  of AI for select G20 countries and estimates AI to boost  India’s annual growth rate by 1.3 percentage  points by 2035.                                                               6 Rewire for  Growth: Accelerating India’s Economic Growth with Artificial Intelligence, Accenture   
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     19      Figure 5: Unlocking innovation through AI     AI for Greater Good: social development and inclusive growth   Beyond just the headline numbers of economic impact, a disruptive technology such as AI needs to be  seen from the perspective of the transformative impact it could have on the greater good – improving the  quality of life and access of choice to a large section of the country. In that sense, the recent  advancem ents in AI seem to be custom -made for the unique opportunities and challenges that India  faces. Increased access to quality health facilities (including addressing the locational access barriers),  inclusive financial growth for large sections of population  that have hitherto been excluded  from formal  financial products,  providing real -time advisory to farmers and help address unforeseen factors towards  increasing productivity, building smart and efficient cities and infrastructure to meet the demands of  rapidly urbani sing population are some of the examples that can be most effectively solved through the  non-incremental advantages that a technology such as AI can provide .  AI Garage for 40% of the world   In addition to providing unique opportuni ties, India pro vides a perfect “ playground ” for enterprises and  institutions globally to develop scalable solutions which can be easily implemented in the rest of the  developing and emerging economies. Simply put, Solve for India  means solve for 40% or more of the  world.  An advanced AI based solution for early diagnosis of tuberculosis (one of the top -10 causes of  death s worldwide), for example, could easily be r olled out to countries in South East Asia or Africa, once  developed and refined in India. Beyond healthcare, AI  technologies in the other sectors including  agriculture, education and mobility are set to transform the world. The commonality of issues with regard  to the above sectors across developing countries provides the ideal use case of developing AI solutions  that could be adapted for multiple markets. Hence, AI technologies suited for the Indian agricultural sector  could easily be customised for other developing nations based on their local climatic conditions.  Education continues to be a major concern in almos t all developing countries. AI technologies that are  capable of imparting quality education to India’s linguistically diverse population could prove very useful   in other developing nations.   Another aspect of India’s potential as a leader in AI is it prove n track record in technology solution provider  of choice. Solved in India  (or more accurately, solved by Indian IT companies) could be the model going  forward for Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS). Indian IT companies have been pioneers in bring ing  technology products and developments as solutions across the globe.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     20    multiple languages, provides the much needed impetus for finding scalable solutions for problems that  have global implications, such as NLP.    Artificial Intelligence has the potential to provide large incrementa l value to a wide range of sectors  globally, and is expected to be the key source of competitive advantage for firms.    a) Healthcare : Application of AI in healthcare can help address issues of high barriers to access to  healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas that suffer from poor connectivity and limited supply  of healthcare professionals. This can be achieved through implementation of use cases such as  AI driven diagnostics, personali sed treatment, early identification of potential pandemics, and  imaging diagnostics, among others.   b) Agriculture : AI holds the promise of driving a food revolution and meeting the increased demand  for food ( global need to produce 50% more food and cater to an additional 2 billion people by 2050  as compared to today). It also has the potential to address challenges such as inadequate demand  prediction, lack of assured irrigation, and overuse  / misuse of pesticides and fertilis ers. Some use  cases include improvement in crop yield through real time advisory, advanced detecti on of pest  attacks, and prediction of crop prices to inform sowing practices.   c) Smart Mobility, including Transports and Logistics : Potential use cases in this domain include  autonomous fleets for ride sharing, semi -autonomous features such as driver assist,  and predictive  engine monitoring and maintenance. Other areas that AI can impact include autonomous trucking  and delivery, and improved traffic management.   d) Retail : The retail sector has been one of the early adopters of AI solutions, with applications su ch  as improving user experience by providing personali sed suggestions, preference -based browsing  and image -based product se arch. Other use cases include customer demand anticipation,  improved inventory management, and efficient delivery management.   e) Manufac turing : Manufacturing industry is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI  based solutions, thus enabling 'Factory of the Future' through flexible and adaptable technical  systems to automate processes and machinery to respond to unfamiliar or unexpected situations  by making smart decisions. Impact areas include engineering (AI for R&D efforts), supply chain  management (demand forecasting), production (AI can achieve cost reduction and increase  efficiency), maintenance (predictive mainte nance an d increased asset utilis ation), quality  assurance (e.g. vision systems with machine learning algorithms to identify defects and deviations  in product features), and in -plant logistics and warehousing.   f) Energy : Potential use cases in the energy sector includ e energy system modelling and forecasting  to decrease unpredictability and increase efficiency in power balancing and usage. In renewable  energy systems, AI can enable storage of energy through intelligent grids enabled by smart meters,  and also improve th e reliability and affordability of photovoltaic energy. Similar to  the manufacturing  sector, AI may also be deployed for predictive maintenance of grid infrastructure.   g) Smart Cities : Integration of AI in newly developed smart cities and infrastructure could  also help  meet the demands of a rapidly urbani sing population and providing them with enhanced quality of  life. Potential use cases include traffic control to reduce congestion and enhanced security through  improved  crowd management.   h) Education and Skilli ng: AI can potentially solve for quality and access issues observed in the Indian  education sector. Potential use cases include augmenting and enhancing the learning experience  through personali sed learning, automating and expediting administrative tasks, and predicting the  need for student intervention to reduce dropouts or recommend vocational training . 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     21    Adoption of AI by various sectors have been influenced by , among other factors,  technical  and regulatory  challenges, but commercial implications has been the biggest determinant. While technic al feasibility,  availability of structured data, regulatory barriers, privacy considerations, ethic al issues, preference for  human relationship have all played their roles in determining the readiness  of a sector for l arge scale AI  adoption; compelling business use cases (e.g. improved efficiency, a ccuracy, speed, forecasting and  accurate decision making) that lead to direct impact on revenue and profitability  have been the biggest  driver for companies to pursue acceler ated adoption of AI. As illustrated  in McKinsey Global Institute’s AI  adoption and use survey, sectors leading the AI adoption today also intend to grow their investment in AI  the most, thus further reinforcing the varying degree s of AI adoption across sec tors.  Figure 6:  Current AI adoption and future AI investments by sector     It comes as no surprise that Banking and Financial Services sector has been one of the leading sectors  globally when it comes to AI adoption, and India has also seen a steep increase in AI based  implementation in recent times. Existing and potential use of Artificial Intelligence in this sector include  improved customer interaction through personali sed engagement, virtua l customer assistance, and  chatbots; improved processes through deployment of intelligent automation in rule based back -office  operations; development of credit scores through analysis of bank history or social media data; and fraud  analytics for proactive  monitoring and prevention of various instances of fraud, money laundering,  malpractice, and the prediction of potential risks. AI in this sector has also been employed  in wealth  management viz. robo -advisory, algorithmic trading and automated transactions .  Similarly , manufacturing sector, primarily automotive and assembly, has been one of the first sectors to  implement advanced robotics at scale. The manufacturing sector in India hasn’t been far behind, as  reflected in a recent study by BCG, where India wa s ranked 3rd in the world in AI implementation in  Source:   McKinsey  Global  Institute AI  adoption and  use survey  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     22    manufacturing, ahead of nations such as Germany, with 19% of companies in the sector already using  AI to a significant extent7.  These trends have also been reflected in the nature of investment in research in India, with private sector  initiatives such as the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBC -DSAI),  choosing to focus their efforts in applied research on sectors such as manufacturing analytics and  financial analytics.   Figur e 6 also reveals that sectors like Healthcare and Education have quite a lot of ground to cover as  far as AI adoption is concerned. Healthcare, despite being one of the hottest areas of AI startup  investments ( Appendix IV : What Do the Markets Say ), is tric ky, especially in the Indian context.  Agriculture doesn’t even feature in the analysis above. Another analysis by McKinsey Global Institute  indicates that potential value of AI for agriculture was in the bottom tercile of 19 sectors evaluated8, and  could be a possible explanation for diminished private sector led AI adoption in agriculture. In sectors  such as these, externalities from adoption of AI far outweigh the economic returns reali sed by private  initiatives, and hence the role of government becomes pivotal in ensuring large scale AI intervention.   NITI Aayog has evaluated various sectors that will be impacted by AI and has taken a conscious decision  to focus on a select set of sectors where only private sector led initiatives will not lead to achievi ng desired  societal outcomes. In addition to Healthcare and Agriculture, focus sectors include Education (preparing  tomorrow’s generation to leverage the global AI revolution to India’s advantage), Smart Cities and  Infrastructure (solving for India’s rapid ly urbani sing population) and Smart Mobility and Transportation  (solving for challenges congestion, pollution, high rates of road accidents leading to economic inefficiency  and enormous human cost).   An unrelated but interesting paradi gm for AI application is the “AI + X”  approach. Despite its vast potential,  the capabilities of AI today are limited to tasks for which it has been specifically trained, and are still many  years from achieving human like consciousness. AI today should thus be regarded as an enh ancement,  or enabler of increased efficiency in previously existing processes, rather than capable of a complete  overhaul of traditional tasks. Deployment can be viewed through the paradigm of “ take an existing  process, and add AI”  or “AI + X”; where “X”  can range from tasks such as driving a car, where AI can  provide incremental value through improved routing and energy management, to act of sowing seeds,  where AI can help inform decision making and improve productivity.   Similar to the effects of electric ity, AI can increasingly be seen as an intelligent, additive utility that can  be deployed at will, but remain largely invisible to the tasks performer. This vision is perhaps best put by  author Kevin Kelley:   “There is almost nothing we can think of that c annot be made new, different, or more valuable by infusing  it with some extra IQ. In fact, the business plans for the next 10,000 startup s are easy to forecast: Take  X and add AI ” .  In applying this paradigm to the development of a national strategy, it is thus important to consider the  challenges faced by individual sectors , or various manifestations of “X”  to best identify the incremental  value that AI can provide. The paradigm also cements the need for collaboration with sectori al  stakeholders in the application of the technology. The paradigm provides a useful framework to analyse  what is possible in terms of technology intervention today.                                                        7 BCG “AI in the Factory of the Future”   8 McKinsey Global Institute “Notes From The AI Frontier: Insights From Hundreds Of Use Cases”  
  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     24       Focus areas for AI intervention    Sectoral deep dives     Healthcare   Healthcare is one of the most dynamic, yet challenging, sectors in India, and is expected to grow to  USD280 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of upwards of 16%, from the current ~USD100 billion9.   Yet, it faces major challenges of quality, accessibility and affor dability for a large section of the population:   a) Shortage of qualified healthcare professionals and services like qualified doctors, nurses,  technicians and infrastructure : as evidenced in 0.76 doctors and 2.09 nurses per 1,000  population (as compared to WH O recommendations of 1 doctor and 2.5 nurses per 1,000  population respectively) and 1.3 hospital beds per 1,000 population as compared to WHO  recommended 3.5 hospital beds per 1,000 population10.  b) Non-uniform acce ssibility to healthcare across the country with physical access  continuing to be  the major barrier to both preventive  and curative  health  services , and glaring disparity between  rural and urban India.     Figure 7: Accessibility of Healthcare across India                                                            9 FICCI -KPMG study   10 WHO website, Pw C analysis   Source:   PwC  Analysis,  World Bank  data (201 7) 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     25    With most of the private facilities concentrated in and around tier 1 and tier 2 cities, patients have to travel  substantial distances for basic and advanced healthcare services. ( Box 2: What TMH’s Cancer heat map  tells us about the availability of he althcare in India ?)   The problem is further accentuated by lack of consistent quality in healthcare across India, most of the  services provided is individual driven rather than institution driven, and less than 2% of hospitals in India  are accredited.   Box 2: What TMH’s Cancer heat map tells us about the availability of  healthcare in India?   Tata Memorial Hospital, one of the leading cancer hospitals in India, registered more than 67,000 new  registrations for cancer treatment in 2015. While the hospital is lo cated in Mumbai, less than 23% of the  new patients were geographically based in Maharashtra, with a whopping 21.7% of patients traveling  from the states of UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal to TMH .   Figure 8 : Geograp hic location of TMH cancer patients   That these patients had to travel more than 1,800 km , on an average,  to avail cancer treatment is an  unfortunate tale of lack of access to quality healthcare. In addition to battling a potentially life threatening  disease, the patients are saddled by the s tress and financial implications of traveling long way away from  home. While the data is not available to such an effect, it wouldn’t be surprising to find that most of these  patients choose to travel to TMH when cancer has developed to an advanced stage, thus further reducing  the chances of successful cure and treatment.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     26    c) Affordability remains a problem with private expenditure accounting for ~70% of healthcare  expenses, of which ~62% is out -of-pocket expenditure, probably  one of the highest in the world.  Significant  portion of hospital costs in both rural (~47%) and urban India  (~31%) are financed by  loans and sale of assets.  Poor and marginali sed are hit the most, and as per the Government  estimates, a sizeable part of th e population (~63 million) are faced with poverty every year  because of their healthcare expenditure11.  d) Reactive approach to essential healthcare  largely due to lack of awareness, access to services  and behavioral factors implies that majority of patients a pproach a hospital / physician only when  a disease has reached an advanced stage, thus increasing the cost of care and reducing the  chances of recovery.   The Government of India  has been making a series of large scale interventions to address India’s  healt hcare challenges, viz. transformation of 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centers, developing district  hospitals to cater to long -term care for non -communicable diseases, Ayushman Bharat Mission,  promoting e -Health etc.   Box 3 : Government of India’s push for Un iversal Healthcare Coverage   The Government of India , through its recent policy interventions, has shown a bold commitment to  achieve Universal Health Coverage and increased access to comprehensive primary health care.  Through  the Ayushman Bharat programme announced in Union Budget 2018, probably the world’s  largest government funded health care programme, the Government of India  has embarked on a path  breaking journey to ensure the affordability and accessibility of healthcare in India. The Ayushman Bharat  – National Health Protection Mission (AB – NHPM) aims t o provide insurance cover of INR  5 lakh per  family per year for second ary and tertiary care hospitalis ation. Ayushman Bharat is targeted at more than  10 crore families (approximately 50 crore beneficia ries /  ~40% of India’s population) belonging to th e poor  and vulnerable sections based on the SECC database, and doesn’t impose any limitations on family size  or age limit for the beneficiaries to avail benefits. The benefits package covers most medical an d surgical  conditions with minimal exclusions , covers pre and post hospitalis ation expenses, and covers all pre existing conditions from day one – thus simplifying availing requisite healthcare by the beneficiaries. The  benefits of the Mission will be avai lable at public hospitals as well as empaneled private health care  facilities.    The Union Budget 2018 a lso included a commitment of ~INR 1,200 crore for Health and Wellness Centres  (HWC), which will lay the foundation for  India’s health system as envisione d in the National Health Policy  2017. These HWCs, to be set up by transformi ng 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres from  2018 to 2022, are  aimed at shifting primary healthcare from selective (reproductive and child health / few infectious  diseases) to comprehensive  (including screening and management of NCDs; screening and basic  management of mental health ailments; care for common ophthalmic and ENT problems; basic dental  health care; geriatric and palliative health care, and trauma care and emergency care) . NCDs a ccount  for ~60% of mortality in Indi a, 55% of which is premature. NCDs are predominantly chronic conditions  and impact the poor most adversely, given the high costs of treatment involved. Prevention and early  detection are therefore of the essence in reduc ing the disease burden attributable to these conditions as  well as ensuring long -term follow -up and manage ment of symptoms for patients. The HWCs, under the  new implementation plan, will provide 12 basic healthcare services, expanding from the current pack age  of 6 services. Crucially, these centres will provide preventive services to improve healthy behaviours for                                                         11 National Health Policy 2015 Draft

A key component of HWCs will be universal screening for NCDs. Screening for five NCDs and associated risk factors has been prioritised given the high burden of disease associated with them. These include  hypertension, diabetes, as well as  three common cancers - oral, breast and cervical. Screening for other conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Disease will be added subsequently. The HWCs will be operated by a mid-level health service provider,  auxiliary nurse midwives, accredited social health activists and a male health worker responsible for comprehensive primary health care services for a population of about 5,000. Figure 9: Features of HWC   The NHPM and HWC, in unison, are aimed at holistically addressing the health needs of the population, including health promotion and disease prevention as well as the delivery of primary, secondary and tertiary services.  In addition, the government aims at leveraging technology to improve healthcare facilities through the: a) the National eHealth Authority (NeHA) which will strategise eHealth adoption, define  standards and a framework for the health sector, put in place  electronic health exchanges for interoperability, b) the Integrated Health Information Program (IHIP) to provide EHR to all citizens of India and provide interoperability to existing EHR/EMRs, c) the Electronic Health Record Standards for India  Despite the obvious economic potential, the healthcare sector in India remains multi-layered and complex, and is ripe for disruption from emerging technologies at multiple levels. It is probably the most intuitive and obvious use case primed for intervention by AI driven solutions, as evidenced by the increasing activity from large corporates and startups alike in developing AI focused healthcare solutions. Adoption of AI for healthcare applications is expected to see an exponential increase in next few years.

The  increased advances in technology, and interest and  activity from innovators, provides opportunity for  India to solve some of its long existing challenges in providing appropriate healthcare to a large section  of its population. AI combined with robotics and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) could potentia lly be the  new nervous system for healthcare, presenting  solutions to address healthcare problems and helping the  government  in meeting the above objectives.     Figure 10 : Potential use cases of AI in Healthcare       AI solutions can augment the scarce personnel and lab facilities; help overcome the barriers to access  and solve the accessibility problem; through early detection, diagnostic, decision making and treatment,  cater to a large part of India.   Cancer screening  and treatment is an area where AI provides tremendous scope for targeted large scale  interventions. India sees an incidence of more than 1 million new cases of cancer every year, and early  detection and man agement can be crucial in an optimum cancer treatment regimen across the country.  NITI Aayog is in an advanced stage for launching a programme to develop a national repository of  annotated and curated pathology images. Another related project under discuss ions is an Imaging  Biobank for Cancer.   Box 4 : AI for India’s cancer woes   Cancer screening and treatment is an area where AI provides tremendous scope for targeted large scale  interventions. India sees an incidence of more than 1 million new cases of cancer  every year, a number  that is likely to increase given the increasing age of Indian population and lifestyle changes. Early  detection and management can be crucial in an optimum cancer treatment regimen across the country.  Good quality pathology service is  the essential building block of cancer care, which unfortunately is not  easily available outside select Indian cities. For an annual incidence of more than 1 million new cancer  diagnosis every year, India has barely 2,000 pathologists experienced in oncol ogy, and less than 500                                                         12 Frost & Sullivan, “From $600 M to $6 Billion, Artificial Intelligence Systems Poised for Dramatic Market Expansion in  Healthcare”   Source:   PWC, “No  longer  science  fiction,   AI and  robotics are  transforming  healthcare”

Machine learning solutions aimed at  assisting a general pathologist  in making quality diagnosis can very well plug this gap in providing  essential healthcare. An essenti al pre -requisite in implementation of such a solution is availability of  quality annotated pathology datasets. NITI Aayog is in an advanced stage for launching a programme to  develop a national repository of annotated and curated pathology images. The comp onents of such a  repository include a move towards “Digital Pathology”, which entails all glass slides generated being  scanned at high resolution and magnification, followed by accurate, precise and comprehensive  annotation of the scanned images using vari ous data sources & levels of clinical & pathological (gross  pathology, histopathology and molecular) information available from day -to-day patient care.   Another related project under discussions is an Imaging Biobank for Cancer. Human cancers exhibit  strong phenotypic differences that may be visuali sed noninvasively by expert radiologists (using imaging  modalities). Recent literature suggests that certain image based features may correlate to molecular and  clinical features like known mutations (KRAS, EGFR, etc.), receptor status, prognostic power, int ra-tumor  heterogeneity, gene expression patterns, etc. Reports have shown an association between radiographic  imaging phenotypes and tumor stage, metabolism, hypoxia, angiogenesis and the underlying gene  and/or protein expression profiles. These correlatio ns, if rigorously established, may have a huge clinical  impact as imaging is routinely used in clinical practice. Moreover, this provides an unprecedented  opportunity to use artificial intelligence to improve decision -support in cancer treatment at low cos t  especially in countries like India. AI based Radiomics is an emerging field that refers to the  comprehensive quantification of tumor phenotypes by applying a large number of quantitative imaging  features. It has resulted in improvement to existing biomar ker signature panels by adding imaging  features.   Credit : Tata Memorial Centre for developing the concepts for Digital Pathology and Imaging Biobank   NITI Aayog is working with Microsoft and Forus Health to roll out a technology for early  detection of  diabet ic retinopathy as a pilot project. 3Nethra, developed by Forus Health, is a portable device that can  screen for common eye problem. Integrating AI capabilities to this device using Microsoft’s retinal imaging  APIs  enables operators of 3Nethra device to ge t AI-powered insights even when they are working at eye  checkup camps in remote areas with nil or intermittent connectivity to the cloud. The resultant technology  solution also solves for quality issues with image capture and systems checks in place to eva luate the  usability of the image captured.   AI based  healthcare solutions can also help in making healthcare services more proactive – moving from  “sick” care to true “health” care, with emphasis on preventive techniques.     
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     30    Agriculture   While India has come  a long way from being categorised as purely an agrarian economy, agriculture and  allied sector still accounts for 49 % of India’s workforce,  16% of the country’s gross domestic product  (GDP)13, and ensures food security to roughly 1.3 billion people.   Agriculture and allied sector is critical to India’s growth story. To achie ve and maintain an annual growth  rate of 8 –10% for the  India n economy,  agriculture sector must grow 4% or higher rate. The Government  of India has recently prioritised Doubling Far mers’ Income as a National Agenda ; putting considerable  focus on supply chain perspectives in agriculture and market development in addition to productivity  augmentation.   Despite making impressive progress and receiving government attention, the sector continues to be  dependent on unpredictable variables, has  weak supply chain and low productivity.   India has not been able to completely remove its exploitative dependence on  resource intensive  agricultural practices. Degradation of land, reduction in soil fertility, increased dependence on inorganic  fertilizers for higher production, rapidly dropping water tables and emerging pest resistance are some of  the several  manifestat ions of India’s unsustainable agricultural practices . As global climate becomes  more vulnerable and unpredictable, dependence on unsustainable and resource intensive agriculture will  only heighten the risks of food scarcity and agricultural distress.   The s ector suffers from poor resource  utilisation,  with the production  quantum  and productivity still being  quite low. For example, yield of cereals, comprising a major share of food grain production, in terms of  magnitude is significantly lower than that of Ch ina and the USA. Technology adoption and efficient  resou rce usage  in these two countries are far higher , thus  resulting in higher yields.   Similarly, use of water in agriculture continues to be high and sub-optimal . The practice of growing water  intensive c rops, and inefficient water management, makes India a net exporter of water and puts India’s  long run agronomic sustainability in question. Despite having just one -third of the gross cropped area  under irrigation, agriculture consumes 89% of our extracted groundwater.

Various Nat ional Sample Survey rounds have shown the  reduction in proportion of value share of crops to overall agricultural value from 78% to 69% since the   Green Revolution14. Thus income disparity between a farmer and non -agricultural worker has increased  over the y ears.15  Figure 12 : Income disparity     On the market side, non -existent functional end -to-end agriculture value chains have caused the price  realisation for farmers to remain low. Access to , and timely availability of services , across agricultural  value chain at the farmers’ end thus becomes a challenge. At present, there is no functional mechanism  to track the capacity of storage facilities available to the farmer. Value chain is not integra ted through its  entire length – procurement to market, including ICT , and banking services. The following figure  effectively captures the present scenario.   Figure 13 : Agri-Commodity value chain in India                                                            14 Doubling Farmers Income Committee Estimates   15 Chand,  R., R. Saxena and S.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     32    AI will have significant global impact on agricultu ral productivity at all levels of the value chain.   An estimate by Markets and Markets R esearch valued AI in agriculture to be USD 432 million in 2016 and  expects it to grow at the rate of 22.5% CAGR to be valued at USD 2.6 billion by 202516.  According to CB Insights, agricultural tech startups have raised o ver USD800million  in the last 5 years.  Deals for startups using robotics and machine learning to solve problems in agriculture started gaining  momentum in 2014, in line with the rising interest in AI across multiple industries like healthcare, finance,  and commerce. From analy sing millions of satellite images to finding healthy strains of plant microbiome,  these startups have raised over USD500 million  to bring AI and robotics to agriculture.   Globally , digital and AI technologies are helping solve pressing issues across the agriculture value chain.  The relative role of each technology in creating impact is dependent on the nature of the work, and the  issues at hand. India has ~30 million farmers who ow n smartphones, which is expected to grow 3 times  by 2020 and 315 million rural Indians will be using i nternet by 202017. An Accenture study says – digital  farming and connected farm services can impact 70 million India n farmers in 2020, adding USD 9 billion  to farmer incomes . These are not futuristic scenarios, they are in play today, enabled by a vast digital  ecosystem which includes traditional Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), software and services  companies, cloud providers, open source platforms, startup s, R&D institutions and others. Future growth  is interdependent on the close partnership among these players.   Figure 14 : Ecosystem crucial for benefits of Precision Agriculture     In 2016, approximately 50 Indian agricultural, technology based startup s (‘AgTech’) raised USD 313  million18. For the first time, this sector is seeing widespread participation by startup s. Intello Labs, for  example, uses image -recognition software to monitor crops and predict far m yields. Aibono uses agri data science and AI to provide solutions to stabilise crop yields. Trithi Robotics uses drone technology to  allow farmers to monitor crops in real time and provide precise analysis of their soil.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     33    with roots in India, uses ML techniques to assess images of farms and predict economic value of their  future yield.   Use of AI and related technologies have the potential to impact productivity and efficiency at all of the  above stages of the agricultural value chain.    Soil health monitoring and restoration : Image recognition and deep learning models have enabled  distributed soil health monitoring without the need of laboratory testing infrastructure. AI solutions  integrated with data signals from remote satellites, as we ll as local image capture in the farm, have  made it possible for farmers to take immediate actions to restore soil health.     Box 5 : Application for soil care   Berlin -based agricultural tech startup PEAT has developed a deep learning application called Planti x that  reportedly identifies potential defects and nutrient deficiencies in the soil. The analysis is conducted by  software algorithms which correlate particular foliage patterns with certain soil defects, plant pests and  diseases. The image recognition ap p identifies possible defects through images captured by the user’s  smartphone camera. Users are then provided with soil restoration techniques, tips and other possible  solutions.    Crop health monitoring and providing real time action advisories to farmers : The Indian agriculture  sector is vulnerable to climate change due to being rain dependent. Varying weather patterns such  as increase in temperature, changes in precipitation levels, and ground water density, can affect  farmers especially in the rainfed ar eas of the country. AI can be used to predict advisories for sowing,  pest control, input control can help in ensuring increased income and providing stability for the  agricultural community.  For example, many agronomic factors (such as vegetation health an d soil  moisture) can be monitored up to the farm level through remote sensing. Using remote sensed data,  high resolution weather data, AI technologies, and AI platform, it is possible to monitor crops  holistically and provide additional insights to the ext ension workers/farmers for their farms as & when  required.      Increasing efficiency of farm mechani sation : Image classification tools combined with remote and  local sensed data can bring a revolutionary change in utilis ation and efficiency of farm machinery, in  areas of weed removal, early disease identification, produce harvesting and grading. Horticultural  practices require a lot of monitoring at all levels of plant growth and AI tools provide round the clock  monitorin g of these high value products.

The app sends sowing advisories to  participa ting farmers on the optimal date to sow. The best part – the farmers don’t need to install any  sensors in their fields or incur any capital expenditure. All they needed was a feature phone capable of   receiving text messages. The advisories contained essent ial information including the optimal sowing  date, soil test based fertilizer application, farm yard manure application, seed treatment, optimum sowing  depth, and more. In tandem with the app, a personali sed village advisory dashboard provided important 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     34    insights into soil health, recommended fertilizer, and seven -day weather forecasts. In 2017, the program  was expanded to touch more than 3,000 farmers across the states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka  during the Kharif crop cycle (rainy season) for a host of  crops including groundnut, ragi, maize, rice and  cotton, among others. The increase in yield ranged from 10% to 30% across crops.     Box 7 : AI for herbicide optimis ation   Blue River Technology has designed and integrated computer vision and machine learning technology  that enables farmers to reduce the use of herbicides by spraying only where weeds are present,  optimi sing the use of inputs in farming – a key objective of precision agriculture .   Increasing the share of price realisation to producers : Current low levels of price realisation to farmers   (as low as 20% in fruits and  vegetables19) are primarily due to ineffective price discovery and  dissemination mechanisms, supply chain intermediary inefficiency and local regulations. Predictive  analytics using AI tools can bring more accurate supply and demand information to farmers, thus  reducing information asymmetry between farmers and intermediaries. As commodity prices are  interlinked globally, big data analysis becomes imperative. Data from e -NAM, Agricultura l Census  (with data on over 138 million operational holdings), AGMARKET and over 110 million Soil Health  Samples provide the volumes required for any predictive modelling.      Box 8 : AI for Precision Farming   NITI Aayog and IBM have partnered to develop a cro p yield prediction model using AI to provide real time  advisory to farmers. IBM’s AI model for predictive insights to improve crop productivity, soil yield, control  agricultural inputs and early warning on pest/disease outbreak will use data from remote se nsing (ISRO),  soil health cards, IMD’s weather prediction and soil moisture/temperature, crop phenology etc. to give  accurate prescriptions to farmers. The project is being implemented in 10 Aspirational Districts across  the States of Assam, Bihar, Jharkha nd, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.                                                             19 DFI Committee Report  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     35    Education   An effective education sector  has the ability to  transform a country through development of human  resources and increase d productivity. In the context of emerging countries particularly, levels of education  and literacy of the population play an important role in development and overall transition to an advanced  economy.    In India, the importance of a developed education sec tor is amplified by a  large youth  population .  Estimates indicate that currently over half the population of the country is below the age of 25. As the  adoption of digital means of gathering data increases, it is important that these methods  are effectively   leveraged to deliver i mproved education and teaching.   The adoption of technology in education is improving,  though not at the pace required.  It is estim ated that  schools globally spent nearly USD 160 billio n on education technology, or ‘E dTech’, in 2016, a nd forecast  spending to grow 17% annually through 2020. Private investment in educational technology, broadly  defined as the use of computers or other technolo gy to enhance teaching, grew 32% annually from 2011  through 2015, rising to USD 4.5 billion globally.  Adoption of new technologies is still lacking, however,  often attributed to unwillingness of teachers and students to adopt technology.     School education in India has seen substantial progress in recent decades, with efforts at both the Central  and State levels, and substantive gains in enrolment have been achieved – Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)  is 97 % at elementary level and 80% at secondary level, as per recent figures. However, low retention  rates and poor learning outcomes mar the impact of ga ins in enrolment.   a) Low retention rates : Enrolment of children is of little use if children are not retained in the schooling  system. Retention rate of 70.7% at elementary level indicates that one -third of enrolled children drop  out before completing Class 8 . Retention rate at secon dary level is also poor at 57.4 %. Low quality  of education is one of the causes of poor retention.     b) Poor learning outcomes : There is increasing concern about the poor learning levels of children in  school, and a new National Achiev ement Survey (NAS) was recently conducted in November 2017.  Previous rounds of NAS results provide an insight into longitudinal performance over time – average  performance of States  / UTs on previous round s showed that over 60% of Class 5 students scored  below 50% across subjects; and for majority of the 31 States  / UTs tested, performance significantly  deteriorated in NAS Cycle -4 versus Cycle -3. Assessments from the perspective of basic foundational  skills also indicate poor learning outcomes – in rural ar eas, only 47.8% of Cl ass 5 children could read  Class 2 level text and only 26% could do Class -5-level arithmetic.     The above scenario is a consequence of a complex interplay of factors that pose challenges to improving  the quality of education:   a) Multi -grade  and multi -level classrooms : For a large proportion of schools, especially in small or  remote villages, it is not viable to have separate classrooms and teachers for different grades  /  classes. Consequently, the teacher is faced with a heterogenous group o f children in the same  classroom, with wide variations in their classes, ages, abilities and learning levels. This large variation  poses a huge challenge to the teacher and is a common cause of poor teaching -learning, thus leading  to poor learning outcomes .  c) Lack of interactive pedagogy and ineffective remedial instruction : Teaching -learning processes in  most classrooms are highly rote -based and non -interactive. Remedial instruction, where conducted,  typically lacks customisation to the child’s learning leve l, abilities, and pace of learning.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     36      d) Inadequate attent ion / action for likely drop -outs: Several children may be at risk of dropout due to  various factors, such as inadequate school infrastructure, poor teachers, poor school readiness,  language barriers, large learning gaps with respect to grade le vel, family circumstances (e.g. migrant  families), poor nutritional or health status, etc.     e) Large teacher vacancies due to uneven distribution across locations : Large number of teacher  vacancies are mostly not d ue to an overall shortage of teachers in a State – instead, they are due to  uneven distribution across different geographical areas within the State. For instance, recent figures  for Uttar Pradesh revealed 1.74 lakh teacher vacancies at elementary school l evel, but a  simultaneous surplus of  0.66 lakh teachers across the s tate.    f) Professional development courses  / training do not cater to real needs and have poor coverage   Existing teacher training is typically a generic kind of an exercise. It is not linked to the specific  weaknesses  / requirements of a teacher – for instance, a teacher with poor arithmetic understanding  requires corresponding training to clarify arithmetic concepts. Consequently, most teacher training  exercises end up as wasted public expend iture, with little or n o benefit to the teacher and her / his  students. Similar issues exist with respect to trainin g of other staff such as school  headmasters/principals. The coverage of existing training programs is also extrem ely low, typically  less tha n 20% annually.   g) Low adoption of existing technologies : A recent survey found that level of adoption of technology in  schools is lacking, and can be largely attributed to lack of teache r training, despite provision of the  ICT infrastructure. While 83% of the teache rs surveyed use computers, the  use is limited primarily to  audio  / visual display, or student practice . A meagre 41% and 27% use technology for tracking  student data and participating in forums respectively. This trend is even more pronounced in th e low  fee school segment surveyed20. Another trend observed is that trained teachers are much more likely  to use technology in the classroom. 88% o f trained teachers reported making  use of available  computers as compared to only 53% of untrained teachers. Trained teachers were found to be nearly  twice as likely to report using technology for communication purposes and for online forum  participation21.    According to EdTechXGlobal , EdTe ch is becoming a global phenomenon, and as distribution and  platforms scale internationally, the market is projected to grow at 17.0% per annum, t o USD 252 billion  by  2020.  India’s digital le arning market was valued at USD 2 billion in 2016 and is pr ojected to grow at a  CAGR of 30%, reaching USD 5.7 billion in 2020  as per  estimates from Technopak.   As per Forbes, in  2017, across every market involved in EdTech, international f unding reached a new  record of USD 9.52 billion, and 813 different EdTech companies rec eived funding s last year. These  EdTech investments mark a gain of 30% from 2016.  VC interest in the education space continues to  grow. For example, one of India’s leading Ed Tech startups Byju’s raised USD 40 million from Tencent in  July 2017, jus t four mont hs after raising USD 30 million from Belgium -based Verlinvest. Among Byju’s  other investors include Sequoia Capital and The Chan Zuckerberg Foundation.   AI has the potential to bring about changes in the sector by supplementing pedagogy and establishing  systems to inform and support decision making across stakeholders and administrative levels. However,                                                         20 Cross Square Foundation, Ed T ech Adoption Survey   21 Economic Survey, 2016 -17 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     37    implementation of AI must be preceded by efforts to digiti se records of teacher performance, student  performance,  and curriculum.  Several AI tools are being s uccessfully used in other parts of the world,  and they can be adapted to the Indian context to target specific challenges.   a) Adaptive learning tools for customi sed learning : While AI may not completely replace a teacher, it  has the potential to greatly assis t teacher s in efficiently and effectively managing multi -level / multi grade classrooms, by judging learning levels of individual students, and allowing automated  development of customi sed educational content adapted to each child’s class and learning level.  Assessing time spent by a student on each part  / page of the learning material, for example, would  allow real -time feedback on student performance to help the teacher appropriately tailor her guidance  to the child. This concept can be extended to au tomatic grading of tests, as well.     b) Intelligent a nd interactive tutoring systems : Intelligent Tutoring Systems can provide great benefit to  students through delivery of learning materials adapted to the child’s proficiency level, learning style,  and pace of learning. In -built pop -up questions tailored to students, for example, can help increase  interactivity, and catch student’s attention and interest. It can also help in assessment of student’s  level of attention or comprehension to appropriately design r emedial instruction.  GradeGuardian, for  example, uses predictive models and visuali sations for student performance with an interactive  dashboard showing anticipated effect of policy  changes. Submission includes 3 componen ts  packaged as a single web app – a Chatbot that inputs student information, an Adv isor Console that  shows students at risk, and a prediction module for policymakers.     Box 9 : Creating ‘smart content’ for improved interactivity   Content Technologies Inc. (CTI), an AI research and development company, develops AI that creates  customi sed educational content. Using deep learning to absorb and analy se existing course materials,  textbooks, and course curriculum, the technology creates custom learning materials, including textbooks,  chapter summarie s, and multiple -choice tests.   A recent hackathon conducted by NITI Aayog also featured ‘ReadEx’, an android application that does  real-time question generation using NLP, content recommendations, and flashcard creation.   c) Predictive tools to inform pre -empt ive action for students predicted to drop out of school : Analysis of  test results and attendance records using AI can be used to predict probable student activities and  inform pre -emptive action. For instance, in a recent preliminary experiment conducted i n Andhra  Pradesh, AI applications processed data on all students based on parameters such as gender, socio economic factors, academic performance, school infrastructure, teacher skills, etc., with the objective  of helping the government identify students l ikely to drop out. Test results could inform suggestions  to enroll  students in vocational studies. Additionally, redressal mechanisms could be put in place to  identify students whose performance can be improved by focus of existing schemes to their family.     
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     38    Box 10 : Microsoft is helping in predicting drop outs in Andhra  Pradesh   The AP government is making concerted efforts to bring down the school dropout rate in the state. It has  tied up with Microsoft to address this complex challenge. Based on specific parameters, such as gender,  socio -economic demographics, academic performance, school infrastructure and teacher skills, an  application powered by Azure Machine Learning processes the data pertaining to all students to find  predictive patterns.   With these data insights,  the district education officials can intervene and help students who are most  likely to drop out. A variety of programs  and counselling sessions could  be conducted for these students  and their parents.   The Andhra Pradesh government, based on  machine learning and analytics, has identified about 19,500  probable dropouts from government scho ols in Visakhapatnam district for  the next academic year (2018 19).  d) Automated rationalisation of teachers : AI tools can be used to develop automated teacher posting  and transfer systems, using analytics based on demand – supply gaps across schools in the State,  candidate’s prior postings, candidate preferences, etc. This would help in plugging of gaps in teacher  distribution more effectively.   e) Customised profes sional development courses : To tackle issues of poorly designed professional  development courses with poor coverage, adaptive AI tools can be used to design automated,  customi sed professional development training content for the teacher based on their perf ormance,  identification of their knowledge and skill gaps. This could then be continuously adapted as  teacher’s skills and concepts improve.     Box 11 : WriteToLearn by Pearson   Pearson’s WriteToLearn software uses natural language processing technology to giv e students  personali sed feedback, hints, and tips to improve their writing skills. In describing his experience using  WriteToLearn, one 7th -grade English language arts teacher said, “ I feel it’s pretty accurate. … Is it  perfect ? No. But when I reach that 6 7th essay, I’m not [really] accurate, either. As a team, [WriteToLearn  and I] are pretty good .” Essay grading technology cannot substitute for a teacher’s ability to provide  feedback and coaching on particular words and sentences: the software merely rates  students’ essays  in genera l areas — such as organis ation, idea development, and style —and then provides generic  suggestions for improvement in these areas. But when teachers use the software as a first pass at grading  and then interject their detailed feed back to address the improvement areas identified by the software,  essay grading becomes a much less time -consuming and laborious process. The net result is that  teachers can spend less time grading and more time teaching, while also giving students more  opportunities to receive customi sed feedback on their writing.    
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     39    Smart Cities and Infrastructure   India is currently in the midst of a surge of urbanis ation. While the percentage of the population living in  urban areas was estimated to be 31% in 201122, recent  research on satellite data indicat es that this figure  is close 45% today23, and predicted to rise to up -to 60 percent by 205024. Though seen as an important  aspect of a country’s economic growth and a major step in the overall development of the country,  unplanned urbanis ation presents challenges such as congestion, over pollution, high crime rates, poor  living standards, and can potentially put a huge burden on the infrastructure and administrative needs of  existing Indian cities.   To tackle these challenges , the Government of India has embarked on an ambitious initiative to set up  Smart Cities across India, aimed at driving economic growth and improving the quality of life , by  harnessing IT solutions . As part of the Smart Cities Mission, 99 cities have been selected with expected  investment of INR 2.04 lakh crores. The strategic components of these Smart Cities include city  improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (greenfield development) in  addition to a pan -city initiative in which smart solutions are applied covering large parts of the city. The  Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) is another related initiative which  targets improving the infrastructure of existing cities.   Smart cities attempt to address the challenges of urbanis ation through development of features based  on IT solutions, some of which are listed below.   a) Poor urban planning25: Smart cities aim to solve challenges of inefficient land use, improper land use  categoris ation, area based development and lack of open spaces such as parks, playgrounds, and  recreational spaces in order to enhance the quality of life of citizens, reduce the urban heat effect,  and generally promote improved ecological balance.   b) Inefficient utility distribution : Through large scale deployment of smart meters in both electricity and  water, smart cities being developed are trying to solve challenges such as low visibility on usage of  utilities such as electricity, water, and waste management. This is also targeted t o help address  issues of leakages in electricity and water distribution, and improper disposal of waste, and have the  potential to significantly reduce cost associate with administration and management.   c) Improved delivery of citizen services: In the domain  of service delivery, smart cities aim to harness  data to solve issues in low accountability and transparency. By using digital channels, they can help  address challenges in administration of offices, and long wait times. Today, poor standards of  grievance  redressal form another pressing issue that may be addressed by increasing adoption of  technology based solutions.   d) Improving public safety: Cities in India today are hotbeds for a range of crimes. Smart cities aim to  address the issues of increase in crime and increased risk of urban emergencies through improved  city design and surveillance analytics.   Some Smart Cities have already begun impl ementing these features through specific projects. Pune, for  example, has launched The Pune Street Light Project to setup energy efficient street lights that can be  remote controlled through a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Surat  has built  a network of more than 600 surveillance cameras which will be expanded to all major locations in the                                                         22 Census 2011   23 LiveMint: “How much of India is actually urban?”   24 LiveMint: “60% of India’s population to live in cities by 2050: government”   25 Smartcities.gov.in  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     40    city, as well as collaborated with Microsoft to develop solutions for water management and urban  planning.   Due to the large amount of data they  can create, smart cities are especially amenable to application of  AI, which can make sense of the data being generated, and transform it into predictive intelligence – thus  transitioning from a smart city to an ‘intelligent city’.   However, the wide rang e of connected devices also gives rise to increased risks in cyber security, with  harmful actors such as hackers now capable of affecting city scale infrastructure.   Some use cases of AI that can augment the features of a smart city are listed below.   a) Smar t Parks and public facilities : Public facilities such as parks and other spaces contribute  substantially to a city’s liveability. Use of AI to monitor patronage and accordingly control associated  systems such as pavement lighting, park maintenance and othe r operational conditions could lead  to cost savings while also improving safety and accessibility.   b) Smart Homes : Smart homes concept is creating buzz with AI technologies being developed to  optimise human effort in performing daily activities. Extending th is concept to other domestic  applications such as smart rooftops, water saving applications optimising domestic water utilisation  for different human activities etc.   c) AI driven service delivery : Implementation of AI to leverage data on service delivery cou ld see  application such as predictive service delivery on the b asis of citizen data, rationalis ation of  administrative personnel on the basis of predicted service demand and migration trend analysis, and  AI based grievance redressal through chat -bots.    d) Crowd management: Use of AI in providing effective solutions in crowd management in recent times  have been in vogue and given fruitful results in averting city -scale challenges such as managing  mega footfall events, emergency and disasters. Accenture worked with the Singapore Government  during their SG50 Celebrations (50th anniversary of Singapore’ independence), and developed  solution aimed at predicting crowd behavior and potential responses to incidents. The solution  resulted in 85% accuracy in high crowd activity, crowd size estimation and object detection. Closer  home, the “Kumbh Mela Experiment” is aimed at predicting crowd behavior and possibility of a  stampede. Similar Big Data and AI solutions could help with advance prediction and response  management .  e) Intelligent safety systems : AI technology could provide safety through smart command centres with  sophisticated surveillance systems that could keep checks on people’s movement, potential crime  incidents, and general security of the residents. Social med ia intelligence platforms can provide aid  to public safety by gathering information from social media and predicting potential activities that  could disrupt public peace. In the city of Surat, the crime rate has declined by 27% after the  implementation of AI powered safety systems.   f) Cyber -attacks: Cyber -attacks seem to pose a great threat to our institutions and public systems,  today. AI technologies possess the capability to detect vulnerabilities and take remedial measures to  minimise exposure of secure o nline platforms containing highly sensitive data from being targeted by  unscrupulous social elements.       
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     41    Smart Mobility and Transportation   Mobility and transportation form the backbone of the modern economy due to their  linkages with other  sectors and impo rtance in both domestic and international trade s. Today’s society demands a high  degree of mobility of various kinds, so as to enable efficient and safe transportation of both people and  goods. As a major contributor to overall emissions, this sector must also be sensitive to ideas of  environmental sustainability.   In India, majority of both passenger and freight traffic is carried through  roads and railways. As of 2007 –  08, roads and r ailways accounted for almost 87% of total freight traffic i n the country and almost 90% of  total traffic as of 2011 -1226. As the economy grows, it is expected that this reliance on these modes of  transport shall continue unless there are major shifts in the p olicy initiatives in the area. The fact that  these modes of transport are particularly pollution intensive compared to shipping and air transport,  further increase the need to implement smart practices in their deployment.   Even apart from issues in poor m odal mix, the Indian transportation sector faces a variety of issues.   a) Congestion and road accidents : Despite having one of the most extensive transportation networks in  the world, various sub -sectors sector continues to be underdeveloped leading to econom ic  inefficiency and enormous human cost. Congestion and its associated costs in India are co ntinually  on the rise. Statistics from Government of India  and a study conducted by IIT Madras suggest the  following growth patterns over the years, respectively.     Figure 15 : Total registered motor vehicles per 1,000 population                                                                      26 NTDPC, India Transport Report: Moving India  to 2032   
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     42      Figure 16 : Projected cost of congestion (USD million / year)       b) High number of traffic deaths: According to a PIB release by the Ministry of Road Transport and  Highways (MORTH) in Mar ch 2017, the total number of road accidents in the countr y during 2015  was 5 01,423 which resulted to 1 46,133 fatalities. The National Highways  (NHs) accounted for about  29.1% share o f total road accidents and 35.0 % of total fatalities . Although the existing NHs comprise  approximately  1.9 % of total road network, they carry about 40% of total road traffic. According to  MORTH statistics, there has been a steady increase in the number of o n-road accidents over the  years.     c) Lack of public transportation infrastructure : Public transport infrastructure development remains  laggard in the overall discourse of transport policy design, either at national and regional levels, with  focus directed toward s promoting and improving private car and associated infrastructure. The  following statistics from MORTH indicates the modal share of public transport (buses) over the years  which has seen, but minimal increase over the years.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     43    Figure 17 : Total numbers of public buses per 1,000 population       d) Assisted vehicle technologies : Autonomy is not economically viable in India currently as driver costs  per kilometre is too low. However, investing in the suite of autonomous vehicle technologies and  exporting such vehicles represents a significant economic opportunity for India and since the same  technologies can play a large role in reducing fatalities and decreasing congestion, it would be wise  for Indian manufactures to invest in r esearch and development of the broader suite of technologies  that are essential for assistive AI.  These technologies can assist the driver by taking driving decisions  which the system has a high degree of confidence in and alerting the driver in case it ha s a low  degree of confidence in any decision. A prime example of such producti sed, assistive AI is the  advanced cruise control used in Tesla vehicles today. This can follow highway traffic and the curves  in the road as well as start and stop in response to  traffic. However, the moment the driver gives any  input, the system is taken over by the driver. This hybrid approach is much safer than an unassisted  human driving, without the potential drawbacks of having a completely autonomous system. There  is anothe r reason why India should not completely ignore assistive vehicle technology research, and  it has to do with the development of new public infrastructure. Since we have only recently begun  building a large share of the total requirement of greenfield infra structure, we have the benefit of  hindsight.     e) Need for sustainable  transportation : The recent initiative of the Government of India for announcing  development of 100 Smart Cities is aimed at addressing this anomaly and catalyse smart strategies  for urban planning which promote sustainable land use design and multimodal integration. While ne w  initiatives could take time to show realisable impact, the existing issues in urban mobility related to  congestion, efficient traffic flow, movement of goods e tc. can indeed be solved using AI technology.  AI can power multimodal integration by assisting with scheduling public transportation systems,  improved accessibility to public transportation infrastructure based on users’ choice behaviours, while  also suggesting real -time travel mode advisory based on predicted traffic situation. AI enabled  mobility solutions can ameliorate several of the challenges being faced by the Indian automotive and  transportation sector.     f) Efficiencies in design of greenfield infrastructure  – Autonomous -ready traffic will have significant  impacts on greenfield road infrastructure design and consequently on greenfield city design. Lane  size, lesser traffic congestion and reduced costs in upgradation of highway infrastructure are some  of the ext ernalities which will benefit the sector of assisted vehicle adoption.    Source:   MORTH  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     44      Listed below are some of the major applications of AI on the mobility front beyond autonomous cars:   a) Autonomous trucking : Autonomous technology in trucking has the potential to transf orm the way we  move goods today. AI can help increase safety and hauling efficiency through intelligent platooning,  wherein trucks form platoons giving drivers the liberty to rest while the platoon keeps moving. Such  a method also ensures optimal road -spac e utilisation, helping improve road infrastructure capacity.     b) Intelligent Transportation Systems : Through the use of an intelligent traffic management system  including sensors, CCTV cameras, automatic number plate recognition cameras, speed detection  came ras, signalised pedestrian crossings and stop line violation detection systems and the use of  AI, real time dynamic decisions on traffic flows such as lane monitoring, access to exits, toll pricing,  allocating right of way to public transport vehicles, enf orcing traffic regulations through smart ticketing  etc. can be made. Accident heat maps could be generated using accident data and driver behaviour  at specific locations on the road network related to topology, road geometric design, speed limit etc.  and s uitable measures could be pre -emptively taken to prevent possible accidents. Also, AI could  help to design sophisticated urban traffic control systems that can optimise signal timings at the  intersection, zonal and network level, while also facilitating se rvices such as automatic vehicle  detection for extension of red/green phase or providing intermittent priority.     c) Travel route/flow optimis ation: With access to traffic data at the network level, AI can help make smart  predictions for public transport jour neys by optimising total journey time including access time, waiting  time and travel time. Considering factors such as accessibility to nearest mode of travel, most  convenient access path based on local conditions and one’s preferences, AI can revolutioni se firstlast mile travel which could change the way we perceive public transport journeys, today. About  private car usage, AI could utilise a range of traffic data sets and one’s own preferences to make  human -like decisions on route selection. With informa tion on dynamic tolls and traffic flows on links,  the dependency on overhead Variable Messaging Systems (VMS) could be minimised, reducing  substantial infrastructure costs. On the systemic level, AI can help predict flow of traffic at the network  level and  suggest alternative flow strategies in order to contain congestion, alleviating cities of this  major issue.     d) AI for Railways : According to official figures, more than 500 train accidents occurred between 2012 2017, 53% of them due to derailment. Train operators can obtain situational intelligence through real time operational data and analyse them in three different dimensions: s patial, temporal and nodal.  Fleet management and asset maintenance including that of rolling stock are pertinent AI use cases.  Recently, the Ministry of Railways, Govt. of India has decided to use AI to undertake remote condition  monitoring using non -intrusive sensors for monitoring signals, track circuits, axle counters and their  sub-systems of interlocking, power supply systems including the voltage and current levels, relays,  timers.     e) Community Based Parking : The availability of parking is a major issue  for Indian cities. AI can help  optimi se parking, likely by minimi sing vehicle downtime and maximi sing driving time. With the advent  of electric vehicles, AI will be needed to mediate the complex vehicle grid interactions(VGI)  as well  as for charging optim isation. Parking guidance systems help drivers to find vacant parking spaces  while they are using the road network and have approached close to their destination. Community 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     45    based parking using AI helps cars in traffic to collect data on vacant parking spac es, and allocates  cars to spaces such that the demand is always met.   Box 12 : Effect on R&D   Globally, research on autonomous vehicle has spurred advances, especially in AI fields of computer  vision and robotics. Due to the extremely high market potential, o ver the past two years, most of the large  investments in AI have been made in the field of autonomous vehicle as it is widely tipped to be the first  large scale commercial application of AI to be adopted.   Moreover, due to the congestion and chaotic conditi ons of Indian traffic, AI algorithms trained on Indian  driving data have the potential to be very robust.    Error rates of object class ification have fallen from 28.5% to 2.5% since 2010 according to the Stanford  AI index. Therefore, current techniques are mature enough to be used in Indian conditions.  Also, within  AI, the core technologies used have high transference potential. The same template used to identify  objects on a road can be used to identify cancerous cells in a pathological image.   
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     46      Key challe nges to adoption of AI in India    Commonality of problems mandate an integrated approach     The preceding analysis of focus sectors – Healthcare, Agriculture, Education, Smart Cities and  Infrastructure, and Smart Mobility and Transport, highlight the potentia l of AI tools and technologies in  transforming the sectors and state of Indian economy as a whole. The analysis, however, also detail a  multitude of challenges that India needs to overcome to reali se the full potential of a disruptive technology  like AI.   Adopting a narrow view and focusing on the challenges for a specific sector, the barriers to developing a  robust set of AI applications may seem contextual and limited to that sector. Taking Healthcare sector as  an example, enabling large scale adoption wou ld require at least the following factors to be addressed:   a) absence of collaborative effort between various stakeholders: while India has adopted electronic  health record (EHR) policy, sharing of data between various hospital chains still remains a work  in progress, since different hospital chains have adopted different interpretations of ‘digiti sing  records’;   b) relevant data is unavailable and there is absence of robust open clinical data sets; and   c) concerns on privacy and security of data, including lack of formal regulation around  anonymis ation of data.   However, analy sing across the focus sectors, the challenges are concentrated across common themes  of:  a) Lack of enabling data ecosystems   b) Low intensity of AI research   i. Core research in fundamental technologies   ii. Transforming core research into market applications   c) Inadequate availability of AI expertise, manpower and skilling opportunities   d) High resource cost and low awareness for adopting AI in business processes   e) Unclear privacy, security and ethical regulations   f) Unattractive Intellectual Property regime to incentivi se research and adoption of AI   These challenges, while by no means exhaustive, if addressed in an expeditious manner through  concerted collaborative efforts by relevant stakehold ers, with government playing a leading role, could  lead to fundamental building blocks that form the core to India’s march towards leadership in AI. The next  section of the paper attempts to solve some of these challenge through specific interventions and  recommendations. These recommendations have been formulated as fundamentally infrastructural in  nature, and hence span across sectoral use cases.
  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     48       Way Forward to Harness the Power of AI    Recommendations     India’s unique challenges and aspirations , combined with the advancement in AI , and a desire to assume  leadership in this nascent technology means India’s approach towards AI strategy has to be balanced for  both local needs and greater good. The way forward for India in AI has to factor in our cur rent strengths  in AI, or a lack thereof, and thus requires large scale transformational interventions, primarily led by the  government, with private sector providing able support.   This section lays down a set of recommendation to address the biggest challe nges and opportunities for  India in the field of AI. The preceding analysis of focus sectors lead us to the assertion that the efforts  need to be concentrated across major the mes of research, data democratis ation, accelerating adoption  and reskilling – with privacy, security, ethics and intellectual property rights permeating as common  denominators for all our recommended initiatives. These challenges, while by no means exhaustive, if  addressed in an expeditious manner through concerted collaborative effort s by relevant stakeholders,  with government playing a catalytic role, could lead to fundamental building blocks that can form the core  to India’s march towards achieving its goal of #AIforAll .  India’s capabilities in AI research are rather limited, both in  quantity (distant 5th globally) and especially  in quality (disappointing impact of research produced). The research community is rather confined to a  handful of academic institutes, and relies on individual brilliance rather than institutional competence.   Acerbating the problem is the fact that private sector’s contribution to AI research has remained meagre.  Despite some encouraging recent developments, viz. Government of Karnataka’s intention to set up a  Centre of Excellence in AI in partnership with NAS SCOM, a lot of ground needs to be covered. The first  set of recommendations focus on turbocharging both core and applied research. In addition, two  frameworks for solving some of AI’s biggest research challenges through collaborative, market oriented  appro ach have been proposed.   The new age of AI and related frontier technologies would disrupt the nature of jobs of tomorrow and the  skills required to reali se the true potential of these transformative technologies. The changes and  challenges anticipated for the workforce will come from both the demand and supply side: demand for  capabilities for jobs that don’t even exist today and diminished demand for some of the jobs that could  be automated, supply of newly minted STEM graduates, a large portion of whom ma y struggle to be  gainfully employed. Given our strength in advanced IT sector and the strength of favorable demographics,  India may seem more equipped for workforce disruption that AI will bring, however our large numbers  may soon turn from potential asset s to liabilities if right structures are not put in place. Our next set of  recommendations focus on reskilling of existing workforce and preparing students for developing applied  set of skills for the changing world of technology.   Early adoption of AI – be it the research community building technology infrastructure, the startup  community developing applications and corporations deploying solutions for their business needs, would  be one of the key determinants in ensuring leadership in AI. Adoption of AI in  India has remained rather  limited, less than a quarter of firms in India are using AI in any form for their business processes and  startup ecosystem in AI is virtually non -existent. Among the several impediments towards large scale 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     49    adoption of AI in India , the primary ones include difficulty in access to data (more specifically, structured  and intelligent data), high cost and low availability of computing infrastructure, lack of collaborative  approach to solving for AI combined with low awareness. Our reco mmendations to address these  challenges include developing large foundational annotated data sets to democrati se data and multi stakeholder marketplaces across the AI value chain (data, annotated data and AI models).   One of the key aspects of our ambition of #AIforAll  includes responsible AI: ensuring adequate privacy,  security and IP related concerns and balancing ethical considerations with need for innovation. Our final  set of recommendations lay down the challenges and suggestion for addressing some of these not so  straightforward implementational challenges of AI.   The recommendations in the following chapters are aimed at initiating an informed conversation on India’s  future roadmap for AI, and are descriptive rather than prescriptive by design. The pa per should be seen  as providing framework for developing National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, and as such, we have  consciously avoided providing specific funding targets and funding mechanisms, as these require broad  based stakeholder consultatio ns.    
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     50        Research    Incentivi sing Core and A pplied research in AI    Advanced research, both core and applied, pro vides the basis for commercialisation and utilis ation of  any emerging technology, more so for technologies like AI .  Where does India stand in Artificial Intelligence research?   India has the necessary building blocks to develop a thriving AI research and development ecosystem,  viz. availability of highly educated talent pool, world class educational institutes and an illustrious list of  top notch  IT companies dominating the global IT landscape. Despite these advantages India sees itself  lagging considerably in producing world -class research and innovation in most technology fields, more  so in AI.   India produced a whopping 2.6 million27 STEM graduat es in 2016, second only to China and more than  4 times the graduates produced by USA, thus producing the requisite talent pool to drive innovation in  emerging technologies. Disappointingly though, an overwhelming majority of this talent pool is focused  on routine IT development and not so much on research and innovation. Exacerbating the problem  further, a majority of the small population focused on research almost always prefers to pursue advance  degrees (Masters or PhD degrees) to subsequently apply their  expertise abroad.   An analysis of India’s competence in core research in AI paints a somber  picture. As per the Global AI  Talent Report 2018, which crawled LinkedIn for its analysis, India only has 386 of a total of 22,000 PhD educated researchers worldwi de, and is ranked 10th globally. The report also looks at leading AI  conferences globally for presenters who could be considered influential experts in their respective field  of AI. On this met ric, India was ranked 13th globally, with just 44 top -notch pre senters. While these two  approaches have their limitations and inherent biases, anecdotal evidence based on discussions with top  researchers reveals that serious research work in India is limited to less than 50 researchers,  concentrated mostly at institut es like IITs, IIITs and IISc.   In terms of the citable documents published in the field of AI from 2010 - 2016, India ranks a distant 5th,  far behind the likes of China and USA and just about edging ahead of Germany and France who have  considerably smaller STEM population .                                                                 27 World Economic Forum  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     51    Figure 18 : Citable documents in Artificial Intelligence (2010 - 2016)     Diving deeper into these numbers, if we look at the country wise H -Index (a metric that quantifies a  country’s scientific productivity and scientific impact),  India ranks a dismal 19th globally. In other words,  while India may be producing research pieces in numbers, their utility has been rather limited .   Figure 19 : H Index for Artificial Intelligence (1996 - 2016 )    Looking at the research coming out of academic institutes, the numbers are heavily skewed in favour of  top-15 institutes, that in total have contributed more than 42% of all research publications from 2 001 –  201628. IISc dominates the research publications, with 7.5% of all publications coming from this institute.  For a country that has more than 750 universities and close to 40,000 colleges, this concentration of  publication is a worrying sign.   The India n IT services companies, the likes of TCS, Wipro and Infosys, have been the flag bearers of  India’s competence in implementation of cutting edge technology solutions, yet their contribution to  research has been limited. Given that these IT giants have been  working closely with businesses globally  and anticipating the trends in emerging technologies, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a sizeable  volume of research work coming out of these companies. Yet, looking at all the research publications  from 2001 – 2016, only 14% of all publications have come from industry, with universities contributing  86% of all publications. Even this limited research publication universe by industry is dominated by Indian  subsidiaries of international companies (~70%), with on ly one Indian company in top -10 (TCS)29.                                                            28 Neel Shah: “Research trends of AI in India”   29 Neel Shah: “Research trends of AI in India”   Source:   Scimago  Journal and  Country  Rank (SJR)   Source:   Scimago  Journal and  Country  Rank (SJR)  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     52    Box 13 : What India can learn from other economies in terms of AI  Research   The US Governm ent is estimated to have spent USD 1.2 billion in non -classified research in 2016 -18 and  the Defence  Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking a budget of USD 3.44 billion in  fiscal  year 2019 -20, an increase of 8.5% compared wit h its request for fiscal 2018 -19. However, US  leadership in AI investment has largely been driven by the private secto r. The world’s leading companies  in AI research in 2016 were Microsoft, Google and IBM, all US companies. According to CB Insights,  based on 2017 figures, Amazon, Google and Microsoft dominate enterprise AI – again all US companies.  It is estimated that mo re than half the world’s unicorns are from the US. The digital eco systems around  the hubs of Silicon Valley, Seattle, Boston and New York, which bring together talent and research  capabilities from leading universities, private investment and cross -science  / industry collaboration, can  be considered to have played an important role in developing the US’s AI capabilities.   While still behind the US in terms of overall investment, China has clear ambitions to be at the same level  as the US by 2020 and the worl d leader in AI by 2030, supported by a ne w development plan to create  a USD 150 billion domestic AI industry. Its plans to build a new AI industry include a national fund that  supports research, f rom the most basic research to critical AI projects. The top 9 universities have  received government funding to each establish an AI school and the remaining 32 to include an AI  programme as part of their curriculum. The Ministry of Industry and Information Techno logy is planning  to put nearly USD 950 million dollars  per year into strategic AI projects for State Owned Enterprises and  the public sector. In addition to state investment, the government is expected (at the time of writing) to  publish Next Generation AI Development Guidelines immanently. The guidelines are  expected to include  a clear governance structure, with allocation of responsibility and plans for research, industry and  legislative action or each of 2020, 2025 and 2030.   While China’s approach  is not necessarily replicable in other parts of the world, there are two key  learnings from its programme:   • Public sector investment, particularly in R&D, helps drive private investment.   • It has a plan with a governance structure and clear milestones. Having a plan instils confidence in  inward investors. Based o n interviews Accenture carried out with inward investors in the UK, there  was consensus that the governments’ public messaging had a significant impact on companies’  confidence and therefore willingness to invest in a country.   In the UK, the universities o f Cambridge and Oxford are considered centres of AI innovation; having  already stimulated three startup s that made major AI breakthroughs and later became prime acquisition  targets. Google in 2014 bought DeepMind, Apple in 2015 purchased VocalIQ, and Micro soft bought  SwiftKey in 2016. This success is supported by funding from organisations like the Leverhulme Trust,  which provides annual funding of GBP 80 million for research. Other capabilities include The Alan Turing  Institute: the national institute for d ata science. The Institute was established in 2015 by five founding  universities (Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford, UCL and Warwick) and the UK Engineering and Physical  Sciences Research Council. The Institute’s researchers work across disciplines and look at theoretical  development and application to real world problems. It was announced as the national centre for AI in  November 2017 and six new universities will join the institute 2018.   The German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI – Deutsches Forschungszentrum für  Künstliche Intelligenz) is one of the world’s largest AI research institutes. It has facilities in the German  cities of Kaiserslautern, Saarbrücken, Bremen and Berlin and is partnering with companies on application  oriented basic rese arch to develop product functions, prototypes and patentable solutions.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     53    The EU’s Robotics Public Private Partnership, launched in 20 13, has seen the allocation of EUR 700  million for research to 2020. This is coupled with private invest ment for an overall b acking of EUR 2.8  billion.   It is believed to be the biggest civilian research programme in this area in the world and could be  considered instrumental in the strong presence of Europe among service robot manufacturers. Clearly,  public -sector investment has  paid-off.  Source : Reali sing the economic and societal potential of responsible AI, Accenture   The research ecosystem in India has seen some green shoots in recent years. Encouraging is the fact  that the number of papers published has jumped 10 fold in last 10 years, from 331 papers in 2006 to  3,301 papers in 201630. IISc, almost all the IITs, some of the IIITs and central / state universities have  increased their research efforts in various foundational and applied fields of AI. IIT Bombay and IIT Patna  have entered into a joint research collaboration with industry to focus on the applied aspects of AI. The  research, focused on IT services and social good, will aim to provide powerful AI insights and  recommendations for improved productivity. It also incl udes software analytics  – building, testing,  managing and mode rnisation of applications, solving real -life social issues such as malnutrition, human  trafficking and climate change through prediction and recommendation models using AI.   Another research grou p at IISc is working on the theory and application of reinforcement learning (RL),  an aspect of machine learning used in optimis ation problems. They are particularly interested in traffic  handling —both the vehicular kind on our roads, as well as the digita l kind in our wireless networks.   Furthermore, there have been some encouraging efforts from both government and private sector in  facilitating top quality research in recent times. Government of Karnataka is setting up a Centre of  Excellence for Data Scien ce and Artificial Intelligence in partnership with NASSCOM. Wadhwani  Foundation has set up India’s first research institute dedicated to developing AI solutions for social good  in Mumbai in Feb 2018 .  However, the research ecosystem still has several obviou s gaps. The Detailed Project  Report of   Inter-Ministerial National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical  Systems has highlighted  some of  these as:   a) Lack of collaborative / interdisciplinary approach:  research is mostly focused in silos in academic  institutions   b) Lack of scale for experimental validation:  due to various practical and financial reasons, university  research is largely restricted to theoretical or laboratory scale. This needs to be augmented with pilot  projects / large scale test beds / lab oratories   c) Lack of facilities to support large scale experimental test beds:  Large scale experimental test -beds  are difficult to construct, maintain and operate, solely by academic institutions   d) Lack of connect with stakeholders and practitioners to convert outputs to outcomes:  The views of the  stakeholders in terms of what application problems to focus on will be of great importance to ensure  practical applicability of the research. At the same time, this should be facilitated in a way which does  not constra int/suffocate the academic researchers in order for them to make foundational advances.  Involving “technology translators” at an early stage, i.e. entrepreneurs/agencies/companies which  can convert the research technologies to commercial products is needed .                                                         30 Scimago Journal and Country Rank (SJR)  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     54    e) Lack of large scale mission mode project management capabilities: Academic researchers usually  work best individually (with a small team of students and research project staff). Current approaches  to research and related facilities may not be suited for large scale experimental projects.   While the numbers point to a small yet encouraging base, a concerted effort is needed to build a  comprehensive research focused AI strategy for India, one that will position India towards global  leadership in this emergin g area of technology. What is evident though is that incremental changes would  not suffice and there is need for transformational  changes to boost research major push coming from the  government.   Framework for promoting Artificial Intelligence Research in I ndia  The Detailed Project Report of Inter -Ministerial National Mission on Interdisciplinary  Cyber Physical  Systems (IM -ICPS) has suggested the following four -tier framework  for promoting research focused on  all aspects of technology life -cycle: research,  technology deployment, translation and management :   a) ICON (International Centres of New Knowledge):  focusing on creation of new knowledge through  basic research,   b) CROSS (Centre for Research On Sub -Systems):  focusing on developing and integrating core  technologies developed at ICON layer and any other sources   c) CASTLE (Center for Advanced Studies, Translational research and Leadership):  focusing on  development and deployment of application based research and   d) CETIT (Centre of Excellence in Technology Innovation and Transfer):  focusing on commercialis ation  of technologies developed   While the above structure has significant advantages, a far more simplified and agile  approach is required  to ensure seamless, target ed and accountable framework for  promoting research. Hence the following  two-tier integrated approach to boost both  core and applied research in AI is proposed :   a) COREs (Centres of Research Excellence in Artificial Intelligence):  COREs will focus on core re search  of AI, and will take on the mantle of executing the responsibilities of both ICON and CROSS as per  the IM -ICPS framework. Thus, CO REs will speciali se in creating new knowledge through basic  research and will source for fundamental knowledge  / techno logies that will be needed to keep India  prepared for the next generation of technologies. Furthermore, CO REs will also emphasi se on  development infrastructure tools for direct application of basic research, including development of  new areas of AI archite cture / platforms.   b) ICTAI (International Centre for Transformational Artificial Intelligence):  ICTAIs  will provide the eco system for application based technology development and deployment, and will take on the mantle  of executing the responsibilities of both CASTLE and CETIT as per the IM -ICPS framework. This will  be an industry -led initiative and expec ted to take on the top -level challenges identified or inter ministerial projects calling for AI based solutions. Furthermore, ICTAIs will also be responsible for  delivering commercial technology, and taking ideas  / concepts or prototypes and turning them i nto  marketable products by way of proactive coordination, communication and interfacing for technology  transfer to the industry.      
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     55    Figure 20 : Proposed integration of COR Es and ICTAIs     In summary, COREs will be focused on core research, in ev olving and new areas of AI, and will act as  the technology feeders for ICTAIs which will be focused on creating AI based applications for, and  accelerating early adoption in, domains of societal importance .   In addition, an umbrella organis ation should be established to address issues relating  to access to  finance , social sustainability and the global competitiveness of the technologies  developed. This body,  which shall be recognised as the Centre for Studies on  Technological Sustainability (CSTS) , could be   established on the lines of the Campus  for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise  (CREATE), Singapore program  or Innovate UK. The major responsibilities of CSTS could be on the  following lines:   a) to monitor the impact of the AI technologies developed at the consumer level through social indices  and recommend necessary modifications for a better market penetration   b) to study the financial viability of the AI technologies developed such that it caters to the target  consumer base, while proposing improved pricing models for a pan India reach   c) to study best practices on pricing models and social penetration of AI technologies across the world  and recommend strategies to foster globally competitive technological development   d) to catalyse international c ollaborations for CO REs and ICTAIs   e) to study the AI landscape in other nations and design strategies for customisation and deployment  of developed AI technologies as per their specifications for a global impact   f) to provide a knowledge management platform for  AI technologies by organising international  workshops and conferences, promoting the confluence of thought leaders, practitioners and  authorities     Centres of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence   COREs for AI will focus on core research, in evolving and new areas of AI.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     56    To start with, COREs could be established at IISc, ISI and top  IITs and IIITs. Given that the research in  AI needs to be multi -disciplinary, linkages need to be established with premier  institutions in other  disciplines viz. AIIMS for hea lthcare, TISS for arts and social science etc.  Furthermore, these COREs  should also act as a guide and mentor for other institutes  researching in AI, in a hub -and-spoke model,  to enable broad based development of AI  research capabilities across India.   The COREs would have to build on both the short -term and the long-term capabilities of these research  centers. In the short -term, given the paucity of quality faculty in India in AI, appropriate incentivis ation  mechanism (which could be a com bination of promis e of topnotch infrastructural facilities and  remunerations matching in ternational standards) to bring top-tier international faculty, especially the  Indian diaspora, needs to be develop ed. Furthermore, the top Indian PhD aspirants, who would otherwise  pursue their studies from  top universities abroad, will need to be retained in India, again through  appropriate  incentivis ation mechanism. One possible way could be to institute National AI Fellowships.   In the long -term, successive PhD classes of these CO REs can increase the faculty pool and work towards  a sustainable operational model for CO REs.  Possible focus area for the COREs  for AI could be:   a) Sensory AI (Computer Vision, IoT etc.) ,  b) Physical AI (Robotics, Industrial Automation etc.) ,  c) Cognitive AI (NLP, worker training etc.) ,  d) General AI ,  e) High precision learning from small data sets ,  f) Research on new algorithms (e.g. advance cryptography, security), data sets etc. , and   g) Explainable AI   An application based model may be followed to selected COREs wherein an applicant institute would  have to demonstrate a viability plan, in terms of faculty and other capabilities, before being anointed an  CORE. A CORE can choose to work on one or multiple focus areas. The COREs will be encouraged to  pursue projects across other COREs, to promote linkages and cross -functional technologies. The  financial component of COREs for AI, which could be to the tune of INR 50 crore – INR 100 crore per  CORE, should als o include large  scale funding for specific projects .   International Centers for Transformational Artificial Intelligence   International Centers for Transformational Artificial Intellig ence (ICTAIs) are envisioned as institutions  focused on creating AI based  applications for, a nd accelerating early adoptions in, domains for societal  importance. These applied resear ch and development institutions should be set up with the elements of  domain or industry “p ull” baked into their structure and operation. While cor e (or fundamental AI) research  and teaching may not be seen as their  priority areas, some flexibility might be built in the structure .   From both funding and operational perspective, the ICTAIs are envisioned to be a truly public private  partnership. A pro fessionally managed society / s ection 8 company (“ ICTAI Inc.”) should be set up and  trusted with the initial contri bution from the government. The management team for ICTAI Inc. should  comprise of suitable representation from  the government, but should hav e a majority of independent  private sector representation. The  mandate for ICTAI Inc. would be to select the ICTAIs to fund and  oversee their progress. In  addition, ICTAIs may commission “ moonshot  projects ” that may span across  multiple ICTAIs  or may need limited term independent project teams to be set up .   ICTAIs are expected to leverage the strength of AI technologie s to solve for application in a specific focus  sector areas. Suggested focus sector areas to begin with, as identified in this  report, are H ealthcare, 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     57    Agriculture, Education, Smart Mobility  and Transportation , Smart Cities and  Infrastructure. ICTAI Inc.  however should have the autonomy to decide on sectors to focus  on and sequencing of sector selection.  ICTAI Inc. should work proactively with private sector  institutions to seek partnerships to set up the ICTAIs  in priority domains .  Furthermore, ICTAIs should have well -defined linkages with the COREs. As a technology feeder for  ICTAIs, COREs should be incentivi sed to commerciali se their research at ICTAIs .   The key to success for the ICTAIs would be their leadersh ip teams. The decision on which ICTAIs to  invest in could involve believing in capability and  the vision of the proposed CEO and rest of the  management team who have appli ed for ICTAI fun ding. Alternatively, ICTAI Inc. may also search and  select a CEO and entrust her with running a particular ICTAI .   The initial funding for a ICTAI would constitute the seed funding  (in the range of INR 200 crore – INR 500  crore  per ICTAI ) for first 5 years to cover the major operational expenses of the ICTAI, in  addition to the  physical infrastructure and technology / computing infrastructure. The seed  funding should be a  combination of funding from the government and private participation,  preferably in equity/grant sharing  mechanism. Corporates should be free to take a  predetermined amount of ownership. One corporate  should be partnered with for each ICTAI  based on a “ challenge method ”. The incentive for corporates to  participate would aris e from  the following points that the government should endeavour to ensure :  a) Access to high quality training data   b) Computational and physical infrastructure   c) A chance for staff at corporates to be part of a national mission and work on challenging  problems wi th a higher gestation period than traditional commercial problems   d) Ability to count expenditure incurred towards CSR   e) Boost in visibility received by working on AI for social good directly with top government  institutions   The ICTAIs should raise additional f unding beyond this base funding, through philanthropic / private  contributions, preferably in equity sharing mechanism as well. ICTAI Inc. may also award further  contributions to ICTAIs based on measures of success .  Each ICTAI should have a Governance Boar d, comprising of industry leaders, academic luminaries and  global thought leaders. The CEO and / or the industry partner (if one is there) may suggest the  Governance Board, which may be vetted and agreed by ICTAI Inc. An industry partner with sizeable  contribution may have a reasonable say in selection of the Governance Board. The responsibilities of  Governance Board will be akin to a Board of Directors / Board of Governors of any suitably large  successful corporation i.e. provide overall guidance and direc tion, and oversee the output for the ICTAI.  While ICTAI Inc. may lay down the success criteria for ICTAIs in general, specific targets for each ICTAI  should be decided between the Governance Board and leadership team of individual ICTAIs .  The ICTAIs should  ideally be located close to top engineering institutes / close to large cities, so that  attracting the best talent from across the world is plausible. ICTAIs should also seek to leverage the  availability of students / research scholars from the engineerin g institutes close to them for specific  projects etc. (through internships etc.) to build the talent pool for future. ICTAIs should aim to involve the  successful AI researchers / practitioners of Indian origin from across the world in either full time or  advisory capacity. If finances are a constraint for ICTAIs to attract the best talent, ICTAI Inc. may consider  National AI Fellowships for the benefit of ICTAIs . 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     58    PRAIRIE Institute, rece ntly established by the French g overnment in collaboration with academia  and  industry, is a good potential implementational model for CTAIs.   Box 14 : The PRAIRIE Institute   The PRAIRIE Institute (PaRis  Artificial Intelligence Research Institute)  is a collaboration of industry and  academia supported by the French government to create an institution which becomes an international  benchmark in AI.   The partners (CNRS, Inria and PSL University, together with  Amazon, Criteo, Facebook, Faurecia,  Google, Microsoft, NAVER LABS, Nokia Bell Labs, PSA Group, SUEZ and Valeo) in PRAIRIE institute  are pursuing three goals:    • to drive progress in fundamental knowledge creation in AI (AI) freely distributed among the  international scientific community;   • to take part in solving concrete problems with a major application -related impact;   • to contribute to training in the field of AI.   The five -year objective is to bring together AI scientific and industrial leaders and mak e the PRAIRIE  Institute a world leader in AI.    The aim of the PRAIRIE Institute is to act as a catalyst for exchanges between the academic and industrial  worlds, to train new generations of researchers in AI and to play a role in leading and coordinating t he  community. Transfer and innovation will be among its duties, along with scientific progress. The work  done will highlight an integrated approach to the two traditional branches of research:   • upstream research, calling on partner facilities of excellenc e in France and abroad;   • research focusing on companies and applications, drawing on industrial partners, who are often also  world leaders in their fields.   Integration between research topics will facilitate synergy between the two branches of the PRAIRIE   Institute and will enable researchers to make the transition easily from one to the other.   At an international level, the PRAIRIE Institute will draw on a network of partnerships with centres of AI  excellence to promote exchanges and leverage impact.

Credit : nVIDIA     Pursuing excellence in research in Artificial Intelligence   To achieve technology leadership in AI, India also needs to pursue “moonshot” projects – ambitious  explorations  that aim to push the technology frontier and that would req uire the pursuit of world class  technology development and leadership in ap plying AI technologies to solve some of the biggest  challenges. A potential project could be teste d on a twin criteria of wheth er it is (a) a new technology or  scientific area that has emerged  or gained traction and has the capability of solving, often in new ways,  practical problems of  importance, and (b) whether it addresses emerging user needs that existing and  availa ble technology solutions cannot address. An example could be development of advanced na tural  language processing (NLP) infrastructure for Indian languages, with features of sent iment and semantic  analysis, or imaging biobank for early cancer detection . 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     60    Some experts believe that such ambitious projects should be driven by the i ndustry, since they have the  requisite resources, technical expertise and are attu ned to practical use cases; and should rarely be  pushed forward by government initiative s. Google’s ad vances in NLP, as underlined by Duplex, is one  such example of private sector  led innovation that pushes the realis able boundaries of technology.  However, the inherent ris k and ambition of such projects does not necessarily lay themselves well to the  funct ioning and methods of most corporations .  ICTAI Inc., the overall governing body for ICTAIs, coul d be the DARPA (see Box 16 ) equivalent of AI  research in India. ICTAI Inc. should have  the full autonomy on selecting the projects of importance and  executing t hese projects, and sh ould be trusted with a separate budget for pursuing such projects. Some  of the key elements of execution include :  a) Projects with pre -defined durations and tenures : Although ICTAIs could adopt the moonshot  approach to select projects, th e projects shall have pre -defined durations for efficient management,  timely reali sation of research deliverables and financial sustainability. The type of project could  govern the timeline, for example a project that requires integration of existing AI te chnologies to solve  a specific problem could have a shorter duration, whereas projects which would require a unique  technological development could be allocated a timeline suitably.   b) Teams of contractors : Speciali sed teams of contractors who have proven cr edentials in advanced  technological development shall be chosen to undertake the projects. Focus could be laid more on  the qualitative impact of past research activity, and less on the size or global recognition.   c) Special emphasis on selecting the right project leaders : Project leaders with the right skill sets to lead  projects of national importance shall be key to drive the research output of projects undertaken at  ICTAIs. They shall be people with proven capabilities in applied research, and the acumen  to deliver  technology in the form most suitable for India and the developing world.   d) Independence : Independence to select projects, design timelines and deliverables and allocate  budgets shall fall within the ambit of the ICTAIs with no intervention of any government agency.  Selection of the project teams based on credentials while collaborating with premier research  institutions with full independence shall ensure a robust technological development that creates  impact.   e) Fail fast model : ICTAIs shall be g iven the autonomy to shut down projects and shift resources to  other operational projects.  With the moonshot approach for project selection, it is plausible that  certain research projects do not provide expected results in terms of efficiency, scalability  or cost. In  such cases, diverting resources to other operational projects with higher probability of research  output delivery would ensure financial efficacy.     Projects could be housed at one ICTAI, but could  involve working across multiple ICTAIs and CO REs.   The algorithms and data used in an AI powered application are key elements in ensuring operational  success. Therefore, it is imperative that the Intellectual Property Regime in the context of AI be robust  and enforceable for innovators to have the con fidence that they will be able to make profits from and take  credit for their work. This is essential for the promotion of innovation, entrepreneurship and core and  applied research in the field of AI.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     61    However, IP in the context of AI has some key differen ces with IP in the context of generic computer  programs or other content due to the way such algorithms are designed and trained with large datasets.  The data fed to an AI algorithm during the training step is key to its success.  Keeping this and other  issues in mind, the g overnment may set up a task force, comprising jointly of Ministry of Corporate Affairs  and DIPP to examine and issue appropriate modifications to the IP regulatory regime pertaining to AI.   Box 16 : Defense Advanced Research Projects Agenc y  Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was created in 1958 as response  to increased US concerns that Soviet Union may have achieved technological superiority following its  successful launch of Spuntnik. DARPA’s founding mission was simple and nimble, “to prevent and create  strategic surprise”.   For the past 60 years, DARPA has been the beacon of scientific breakthroughs and radical innovations.  Amongst its success stories include the internet, RISC computing; global positioning satell ites; stealth  technology; unmanned aerial vehicles, or “drones. While originally created for US military, the agency  has played a pivotal role in giving genesis to several multi -billion dollar industries.   What is even more impressive is DARPA’s agility and  swiftness despite a small team and modest  budgetary allocations. DARPA’s total support staff is only 120 strong, an d its annual budget is only USD 3  billion. DARPA accomplishes most of its programs through a “speciali sed project” model – assembling  project  specific teams of experts from universities, industry, government and non -profit, with well -defined  targets and tenures.   The three essential elements of DARPA are:   a) ambitious goals:  the projects pursued by DARPA are designed to solve real -world problems  or create  new opportunities. The problems are such that they can’t be solved without pursuing new frontiers or  cataly sing new developments. Urgent need for application underlines the problems.   b) temporary project teams:  teams of world -class experts from industry and academia are assembled  to work on well -defined projects of relatively short duration, led by accomplished technical managers.  Given the intensity, sharp focus and reputation attached, these projects attract h igh caliber talent  who achieve extraordinary levels of collaboration.   c) independence:  DARPA has complete autonomy in selecting and running projects.     Source:  Harvard Business Review article “Special Forces” Innovation: How DARPA Attacks Problems published  October 2013   CERN for AI   Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at NYU, mooted the idea of a  CERN for AI at the #AIforGood  Summit in Geneva in June 2017. In an OpEd for the New York Times, Gary further elaborated on the  idea:   “I look with envy at my peers in high -energy physics, and in particular at CERN, the European  Organi sation for Nuclear Research, a huge, international collaboration, with thousands of scientists and  billions of dollars of funding. They pursue ambitious, tightly defined projects (like u sing the Large Hadron  Collider to discover the Higgs boson) and share their results with the world, rather than restricting them  to a single country or corporation.”  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     62    Box 17 : European Organi sation for Nuclear Research aka CERN   CERN, established in 1954 by 1 2 founding European nations, had its origins in establishing a truly  international scientific collaboration to pursue world class research in particle physics. Among the biggest  of the several achievements to come out of this remarkable collaboration, home  to the world’s biggest  atom smasher (the Large Hadron Collider) include the development of World Wide Web and the discovery  of the Higgs boson (the ‘God Particle’), W and Z bosons, Antimatter etc.   CERN’s current 21 member states each contribute to the ove rall CERN budget (CHF1,240 million in  2013). Special contributions are made to specific projects, like Large Hardon Collider, by interested Host  States and non -member states. The biggest chunk of CERN’s budget is spent on the construction of its  enormous s cientific installations, most of which are too expensive for a single country to afford.   The current state of AI, which is focused on solutions to narrow applications, and grappling with questions  around next phases of development, ethics, security and pri vacy may benefit from a global public AI  research institution advancing the field for the good of humanity, the “People’s AI”31.   To achieve #AIforAll, which gives the mandate for inclusive AI for the world, the Government of India  should take the lead in b ringing together the relevant parties to create People’s AI, the CERN for AI. India  has a proven track record for leading projects with ambitions of greater good. India is already playing a  leading role in climate leadership, with Hon’ble Prime Minister Na rendra Modi vowing to go “above and  beyond” India’s commitment on Paris Agreement on climate change. Similarly, India has been a pioneer  in a sustained push for clean energy revolution by leading the International Solar Alliance, and setting an  ambitious t arget of 100GW of installed solar energy capacity by 2022. With 20GW of installed solar  capacity, India is well and truly on its way to achieving this target. With the Government  of India ’s focus  on inclusive growth which saw several transformational refor ms in the last few years, India is poised and  most suited to wear the mantle of leading the #AIforAll movement. Furthermore, India offers the best  possible test bed and a plethora of use cases for building AI solutions fulfilling the inclusive AI criteria,  be  it in healthcare, education or agriculture.   While the modalities of funding and mandate for this #AIforAll should be the subject of further  deliberations, the proposed centre  should ideally be funded by a mix of government funding and  contributions fro m large companies pursuing AI (GAFAM, BATX etc.). Where should this centre  be  located? Nowhere and everywhere. While the CERN had the requirements of physical facilities such as  the Large Hadron Collider, #AIforAll could be distributed across different reg ions and countries. The  Government of India, through NITI Aayog, can be the coordinating agency for initial funding and setting  up the requisite mandates and human and computing resources.   The mandates of the #AIforAll should include challenges of AI that  are common to other countries and  large corporations and startups alike, and the foundational components that could truly make AI inclusive  and good for all. Suggestive technology topics could include:   a) General AI;   b) Opening the Black Box / Explainable AI;   c) Advanced anonymi sation protocols for data security and privacy;                                                          31 Medium.com “The People’s AI: democratizing AI research and development”

Similarly, Declaration on Cooperation  in Artificial Intelligence was signed by 25 states of European Union on 10th April 2018. What is needed  though is a co mmitment and collaboration of truly international standards to develop and ensure #AIforAll .    
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     64       Skilling for the AI age    Getting India ready for the AI wave     History suggests how technology has disrupted the nature of jobs and the skills required to perform them,  requiring the global workforce to continuously adapt. Advent of AI has accelerated this disruption to a  pace that has not previously been seen , due to the wide range of capabilities it offers and speed at which  it is developing.   NASCCOM predi cts that by 2022, a startling 46% of the Indian workforce will be engaged in entirely new  jobs that do not exist today or jobs that have radically changed skill sets32. Some other sources estimate  that demand for AI and machine learning specialists in India  is expected to see a 60% rise by 201833. In  the data domain as well, an independent study estimated that India will face a demand -supply gap of  2,00,000 data analytics professionals by 2020 .  In the IT -BPM sector, traditional software developer roles are set to transition to roles such as computer  vision engineers, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) engineers and cloud architects, among others. At  the same time, completely new job roles such as language processing specialists and 3D modelling  engineers are s et to arise as the technologies are increasingly adopted and deployed34. With AI, such  transition would move beyond the IT sector and affect sectors such as education, health, agriculture,  finance etc, requiring the underlying skill sets.                                                                                   32 Future of Jobs in India: A 2022 Perspective, 2017    33 KellyOCG, India   34 Future of Jobs in India: A 2022 Perspective, 2017   
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     65    Figur e 21: Transition in jobs and skill sets     The demand for new -age jobs is accelerating in India, and can be attributed to three major factors35, viz.  increased adoption of technology; shift in market demographic s and de -acceleration of globali sation.   Figure 22 : Impact of primary forces on jobs in 2022     As technology adoption increases across sectors, so will the demand for skills required to implement   them. India’s growing middle class and millennial demographic form a major part of the market for  technology enabled products. As the size of these demographics increases, so will the demand for these  products, and thus the workforce that can enable their  creation. Increased globali sation played a major  part in the creation of jobs in the services sector. However, as the permeation of automation increases,                                                         35 Future of Jobs in India: A 2022 Perspective, 2017    Source:   Reworking  the  Revolution,  Accenture   Source:   Future of  Jobs in  India: A  2022  Perspective,  2017  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     66    and protectionism among previous markets for these services becomes predominant, it is important to  recogni se that these jobs will see a large overhaul.   India may appear to be relatively well positioned to take advantage of the AI disruption by virtue of its  advanced IT sector and large youth demographic potential to establish itself as the future hub fo r AI  related activities. However, given the poor availability of qualified faculty and researchers, this advantage  could fast transform into a liability without urgent government interventions towards promoting access to  such skills. This is a critical com ponent of AI development, and should be a national priority.   Changing nature of the global service sector, uncertain impact of automation in manufacturing, and poor  infrastructure can pose a challenge to the task of enabling up -skilling or re -skilling.   Shifts in the outsourcing  needs of developed economies have the potential to impact India dramatically.  As multinational companies move toward ‘in -shoring’ or ‘no -shoring’ due to development of automation  technology and increasingly protectionist measures g lobally, it is of critical importance that the  outsourcing industry (which cur rently accounts for roughly 15%  of India’s total labour force) adapts to  these changing needs accordingly .   Figure 23 : India IT -BPM sector     As indicated below , automation could affect even traditional sectors in a variety of ways. Agriculture is  predicted to see a net decrease in jobs due to automation, while the job opportunities in the construction  sector are predicted to improve significantly. These large scale shifts in employment depend largely on  the nature of technology being developed as well as deployed, and are very hard to predict for any  informed policy intervention .      Source:   NASSCOM,  ICRIER,  McKinsey  analysis  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     67    Figure 24 : Impact of automation     Multiple studies have underlined the lack of employment readiness of STEM graduates, thus highlighting  the poor standard of education in engineering colleges in India. A s per some est imates, almost 80% of  engineering graduates  are unemployable on graduation . Low availability of speciali sed faculty; lack of  flexibility in curriculum revisions in engineering and computer science courses to keep up with rapid  advancements in technology; a nd low levels of interdisciplinary research in AI related fields to facilitate  an AI education for non -computer science engineering (and vice versa), are just some of the factors that  have led to this scenario.   At the school l evel as well, poor outcomes i n Maths and reading are particularly troubling , since these  subjects form the foundation of knowledge required to move to an AI related education, and later jobs in  the domain .  Recommendations   For addressing issues relating to skilling, a two -pronged approach is warranted, one set of interventions  aimed at the workforce and the second for the students.   1. Workforce   Re-skilling of the current workforce will require integration with relevant existing skilling initiatives, buildin g  of new platforms that can enable improved learning, and novel methods of allowing large scale  employment generation through promotion of AI .   a) Incentivi sing creation of jobs that could constitute the new service industry : To tackle the challenge  of shifts  in the services industry, it is important to identify and promote creation of jobs that may  replace traditional IT -BPM sector jobs in the future. These jobs would ideally be a part of the AI  solution development value chain, but require a relatively low l evel of expertise so as to create  employment at scale . Tasks such as data annotation, for example, have the potential to employ a  large quantum of human resources, and serve countries all over the world in otherwise capital  Source:   McKinsey,   Jobs Lost,  Jobs  Gained:  Workforce  Transitions  in a Time of  Automation  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     68    intensive projects. Tasks such a s image classification or speech transcription require low levels of  expertise and present an opportunity to exploit labour cost arbitrage to serve companies globally.  Specific policy interventions could be considered like tax holidays, inclusion under CSR  activities,  etc. to help solve the dual problem of workforce job displacement and creation of expertise in  fundamental sections of the solution development value chain.     Box 18 : Impact sourcing through Samasource   Samasource is a pioneer in impact sourcing  of technology services, the practice of hiring people from the  bottom of the income pyramid and directly raising them out of poverty by providing digital work for  companies like Google, Walmart, eBay, and many startups.   About two -thirds of their work is in managed services for image capture and annotation. They need a  large pool of skilled, detail -oriented workers to identify the appropriate images or video frames and  manually tag the scene, specific regions (a forest), or objects (a wolf) with the specif ic keywords the  customer requires for their application.   Samasource quotes its top objective as ‘creating technology jobs for the impoverished while delivering  the highest quality work in a cost -effective manner’. This  guided Samasource to focus on E ast Af rica,  where the majority of the population has completed secondary or high school , and has a good  understanding of basic English language . They have a dedicated training organi sation that works within  the local communities to identify qualified men, women and youth in need and assess them for key skills.  For those with strong visual acuity, there is general computer and business skills training and a 3 -week  dedicated machine learning and image annotation training track with example projects and ongoing  asse ssments that lead to graduation   As workers get moved to projects, there is another set of qualification tests and project -specific training.  Once they pass those, they are moved into production for the project and their work is reviewed daily by  the QA tea m to correct mistakes and resolve interpretation or requirements issues (do you want to tag a  traffic light facing away from the camera?). These reviews are done both locally and in the US, allowing  real-time feedback with many checkpoints throughout the p roject lifecycle, reinforcing Samasource’s  tightly managed approach to quality.   Samasource reportedly provide jobs and digital skills training to people below the poverty line in Kenya,  Uganda, Haiti, and India. Since the company started in 2008, Samasourc e has been able to hire nearly  8,000 people. As a result, they’ve could transition themselves and their dependents out of poverty and  provide living wages, transforming over 30,000 lives.   b) Recognition and standardi sation of informal training institutions : The increasing demand for AI or  data related job positions has not gone unnoticed by the Indian workforce, with a large percentage  of them opting for training institutions to bridge their knowledge gaps. In technology hubs such as  Bengaluru, this has led to  many traditional IT training institutions establishing courses in new age  technologies. However, their standard of education is hard to assess for companies looking to hire.  Implementation of recogni sed certificate courses through higher education institu tions could be a  major boost to recogni sing resources spent on re -skilling, and holding these institutions to standards  in delivery of knowledge. International School of Engineering (INSOFE), for example, provides  certification recognised by the Language T echnologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)  for a post -graduate program in data analytics and optimisation. Jigsaw Academy’s data science post graduate program gets its students certified from the University of Chicago Graham School . 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     69    Integrat ion and application of existing standards such as laid out by the National Skill Qualification  Framework (NSQF) should also be explored. Given that standards in areas such as big data exist  but are not used by institutions for certification also highlights  the need for them to be designed in  closer collaboration with the private sector.     c) Creation of open platforms for learning : Initiatives such as the NASSCOM Future Skills Platform will  play an instrumental role in large scale dissemination of requisite ski lls to some major sections of the  employed workforce. Online and self -learning platforms, such as Coursera and edX, are able to  connect learners to the best universities and institutions from around the world, and can play a crucial  role in this scenario. There is need to bring out guidelines for promoting these while ensuring  uniformity, standards and usability. As in the promotion of MOOCs, large scale deployment and  adoption of these platforms requires stringent measuring of quality, and recognition of t heir  certification.     d) Creating financial incentives for reskilling of employees : Initiatives in reskilling of employees or  allowing employees to undergo reskilling initiatives have a high opportunity cost for private  companies, and may affect their willingn ess to let their employees engage in the process at scale. It  is thus suggested that co -funded models between the government and companies be explored, in  the IT sector particularly.  Financial incentives for private companies could include payroll taxes wh ich  are dedicated to subsidi sing training opportunities, income tax deductions for companies participating  in reskilling initiatives, special taxes to be paid if a minimum training budget is not disbursed, as well  as public grants for subsidi sing training especially for smaller sized firms.  Considering also the time  required for reskilling, and the cost it entails to employers, financial incentives may also be tied to  mandatory allocation of time for reskilling activities by companies for their workforce. H owever, in the  absence of standardi sation of training modules and institutions , such initiatives could be prone to  misuse .    2. Students   The education sector needs to be re -aligned in order to effectively harness the potential of AI in a  sustainable manner.  In primary and secondary schools, there is a need for transition to skill based  education in subjects relevant to AI. Often critici sed for being overly knowledge intensive, Indian  education is in urgent need of transition particularly in subjects relevant  to STEM, or computer based  education. As jobs based on technology become prominent, so will the need to develop applied skills in  a continuously changing environment .   Increased amount of project related work across education levels, promoting schemes lik e the  establishment of ATLs (Atal Tinkering Labs) in schools, necessary change in curricula in schools, are  some of the steps that need to be considered to promote early adoption of technology organically.   In higher education institutions there is need for  increased collaboration between industry and academia  through creation of channels of communication between faculty and industry to promote exchange of  ideas and expertise. Various avenues of collaboration need to be explored, including workshops,  incenti ves for guest lectures by professionals and institutional arrangements for regular re -design of  courses in collaboration with the private sector.   Lack  of qualified faculty that poses a serious problem in the present scenario can be addressed through  innov ative initiatives like credit -bearing MOOCs  (Massive Open Online Courses). Acceptability and  adoption of these decentrali sed teaching mechanisms can be ensured through prescribed certification in  collaboration with the private sector and educational instit utions.  Initiatives such as the SWAYAM  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     70    platform36, are in the right direction but these need to be further reinforced through additional investment  and collaboration with the private sector and educational institutions in order to meet the market  demand.       Countries like the USA , that have a thriving student and research community engaged in AI, have  effective bridge courses, generally at post graduate levels for non -related fields. Thus at a post -graduate  level, the focus shifts to creating  incentives to  conduct research in domestic institution s and allow  cross disciplinary collaboration and education . Similar initiatives are required in Indian educational space with  bridge courses in AI for post -graduates in non -computer science or data science domains t o encourage  cross -domain research and the ‘AI + X’ paradigm.  One year courses could be explored that will enable  students of a range of subjects to build foundations of knowledge in the AI space, and effectively apply  domain expertise to solve pressing pro blems.   This is an ever evolving area and needs to go beyond the one time solutions with an institutional  framework in place that is responsive to changing scenarios. Such a framework would enable a more  sustainable and customi sed solution. A  standing comm ittee or task force  comprising of all stakeholders   may be constituted by the government  with the objective of examining and reporting the changes in  employment caused by AI in India. This taskforce would consider not only IT related activities, but the job  ecosystem as a whole. As AI continues to evolve, this will facilitate evidence based d ecisions in funding  of educational institutions, promotion of specific sectors, and channelling of human resources to be most  efficiently utili sed.                                                             36 developed by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the Ministry for Human Resource Development  (MHRD)  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     71       Accelerating Adoption    AI across the value  chain     Global Context    Adoption of AI globally is still in its nascent stages, but growing rapidly. A 2017 survey by  Statista finds  that 78% of firms globally are either using AI extensively, or have plans  for use in near future. Firms in  China and the US especially, are proactively engaging with  their research co mmunities to enable early  adoption  and position themselves competitively .   Figure 25 : Survey of global firms on adoption of emerging technologies in 2017 (In which of the  following new and emerging technologies is your organi sation making investments over the next year?)     A McKinsey report on “AI: The next digital frontier” concludes that AI adoption outside of the tech sector  is at an early and often experimental stage and deployment  at scale  has been rare. In the survey of 3,000  AI-aware top management executives, across 10 co untries and 14 sectors, only 20%  use any AI related  technology at scale or in a core part of their businesses.   As the field is rapidly evolving, investments made in cor e AI research and product development is another   indicator of adoption. The McKinsey report estimates that  organisations invested around USD26 – USD39  billion in AI while USD6 – USD 9 billion was invested in startups in the year 2016.   Adoption of AI in In dia has  been slow  and remains limited. Estimates indicate that only 22% of the firms  in India use AI in any business process37. Indian startup s have been able to  raise just  USD 87 million in  2017, as against over  USD 28 billion raised by the Chinese startup s in 201738.   Low adoption of AI technologies in India is particularly troubling , given the country’s  prominence in  the global  IT industry that could have given  it the natural first mover’s advantage  in AI. However, the IT  industry in India has remained conte nt in delivering traditional IT services and has been  slow to adapt to  new digital technologies compared  to its  counterparts in China and the US.                                                            37 Intel and IDC Survey Report, dated   38 XinhuaNet “AI sector sees big investment, financing in 2017”   Source:   Accenture  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     72    Despite its sectoral leadership and programming talent,  India’s IT industry with over USD 160 billion  annual revenue, has yet to build pioneering AI  / ML capabilities commensurate with its potential.  Nevertheless, the top 5 IT service companies have begun to use AI to cut costs and automate business  processes. Wipro has built Holmes , an AI platform that deploys “ bots” to carry out repetitive and mundane  tasks. TCS has created its own AI platform, Ignio , and Infosys has built Nia, improving  upon its earlier  Mano  platform. While promising, these early efforts remain far from revolutionary.   The limited success of Indian technology players to effectively adapt and carry forward the AI revolution  suggests the need for government intervention to promote AI adoption, lest India lose the chance to  secure a prominent position on the global AI map. While acknowledging the  need to promote AI,  governments at different levels, along with their various instrumentalities, should adopt proactive  measures to accelerate AI adoption in various processes .   The major market segments for the increased AI adoption are:   (a) Private enterpr ises: mostly driven by marke t and enterprise considerations,   (b) Public Sector Undertakings : imperative to drive up the  operational efficiency of PSUs,  and  (c) Government : improve process efficiency, reduce human discretion, eliminate middlemen, advance  prediction , pro-active and predictive service delivery to citizens .  The steps taken by the g overnment, in terms of incentives or in providing infrastructural platforms, will  have varying control and influence on all these segments – least on private enterprises to m ost on  government agencies.   AI adoption in India will face the following challenges:   (d) Lack  of adequate talent to build and deploy AI systems at scale . An estimate claims that only 4% of  AI professionals in India have worked on emerging technologies such as  deep learning and neural  networks. There is also a significant gap of PhD research scholars in the field.   (e) Difficulty  in access to industry specific data required to build customi sed platforms and solutions  currently concentrated in the hands of a few majo r players . It is difficult for new entrants to deliver  tailor made services that can compete with data rich incumbents such as Facebook or Google. This  phenomenon results in the creation of a virtuous cycle which reinforces the hegemony of the big few,  creating a huge entry barrier for startup s.  (f) High cost and low availability of computing infrastructure required for development, training and  deployment of AI based services . Cloud infrastructure, though growing  rapidly, has limited capability .  Also lacking a re AI -as-a-service models of cloud platforms. Lack of infrastructure has led to many  Indian AI startup s to incorporate their business outside the country, which makes AI outside the reach  of Indian researchers in government labs and many industries. Initia tives like GI Cloud (MeghRaj),  are in the right direction.   (g) Low awareness of AI  for resolving business problems in most public enterprises and government  agencies, especially given the scarcity of AI professionals, is obstructing adoption.      
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     73    Following spe cific initiatives are recommended for promoting AI adoption in the country:   Recommendation 1: Creating a multi -stakeholder Marketplace   To encourage the development of sustainable AI solutions at an appropriate price point for sectors such  as health, educat ion, and agriculture, it is necessary that a level playing field be ensured and a supportive  environment be created for all players in the value chain. The development of any working AI -based  product is a long process with very different speciali sed activi ties that are necessary for final delivery, just  like any other product or service value chain.   Figure 26: AI Value Chain     It is exceedingly difficult for a small or medium business  / startup to vertically integrate all these processes  and have the internal capacity to deploy them simultaneously before even entering the market. Therefore,  this acts as a barrier to entry for new players. On the other hand, for different firms to take up different  activities and still deliver useful products, a strong,  stable price discovery mechanism has to exist for  incentives to align and sustainable business models to come up for the different parts of the value chain.  Another well documented and substantial barrier to entry is the difficulty of acquiring the raw ma terial  (data) in the first place since as noted above, most usable data is in the hands of a few players.   Towards providing a level playing field, addressing information asymmetry, and incentivi sing and  simplifying collaboration between the various stakeho lders in the AI ecosystem, a marketplace may prove  to be a potent tool provided it enables the following:   (a) Discovery of required AI component : ability to reference assets , be it  data or ML models, and  services, such as annotation, and enable curation and r ating of these assets.   (b) Platform to execute transactions : with mechanisms to exchange value of a specific good and service  for currency or subscription models for APIs.   (c) Verification of transactions : ability to verify the occurrence of transactions and the r eceipt of goods or  services in exchange for currency.   Such a marketplace model would benefit by:   a) Reducing asymmetry of information: With a reasonable volume of transactions, aberrations caused  due to data oligopoly will reduce, thus reducing the spread in  pricing and effectively incentivi sing  both data owners and AI model creators.   b) Encouraging speciali sation in different niches by firms and creation of novel business models : Easy  availability of raw components required at different stages of the AI solution development cycle  would allow firms to focus on specific problems, rather than attempt to build capability across the  value chain. For example, a new segment of startup s could entirely focus on the problem of curating  raw data to be put on the marketplace, rather than attempting to do all the above at once.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     74    Consequently, such startup s will see a better market for VC funding as they will be able to  substantially mitigate thei r business risks, if an easily accessible, formal market for raw data exists.   c) Unlocking new sources of data and enabling more efficient use of computational and human  resources : Estimates suggest that only 1% of data today is analysed due to its existence  in various  unconnected siloes. For example, medical imaging  / diagnostic centres today are collecting valuable  data. It is currently not used to its potential as there is no way for diagnostic centres to build predictive  disease models without hiring AI e xperts, renting computational expenditure, and indeed shifting  gears completely to become an AI company. In the presence of a formal market with a fair  mechanism of price discovery, such diagnostic centres would have an incentive to collect this data,  have  it curated, and place this data in the market with appropriate permissions and safeguards.  Concurrently, machine learning experts in AI firms would be more productive as they could focus on  the problem of creating the model rather than that of sourcing th e data and curating it.   d) Address ethical concerns regarding data sharing : Today, transactions and buying of data occur in  an informal marketplace. However, there is no mechanism currently to ensure that appropriate  permissions are taken from the actual dat a owners before data custodians share the data. Going  back to the example of diagnostic centres (which are data custodians in this case), it would become  necessary for firms to take consent of individuals getting imaged to aggregate and sell their data.  This could create mechanisms through which individuals are ultimately compensated. In this way,  the informal market for data could be nudged towards entering the formal econom y.  Recommendation 2 : Facilitating creation of large foundational annotated data set s  In India, lack of annotated data in the domestic context has emerged as a major impediment in  development of AI solutions for both startup s and core research alike. Availability of general data corpora  which can be applied across product functions can serve to provide a ready source of data (in ‘plugin’  mode) to startup s and enable solutions customi sed to the Indian context. There is evidenc e to suggest  that ready availability of large corpora can spur research and innovation  in the field of machine learning .    Figure 27 : Breakthroughs in AI     By its very nature, this task is laborious and despite innovations in automatic annotation, such as the  development of GoogleNet object classification, human annotation and training of data sets are not  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     75    expected to be replaced in the near future. This is b est exemplified by the thriving investments and  startup s in this area. As lately as 2017, Alegion, Scale, CloudFactory, Mighty AI, and CrowdFlower, all  companies that enable human intervention to data a nnotation, have received about USD 50 million in  invest ment funding.   Given the nature of this task, it is necessary for the government to explore assistance in building of large  corpora of data across domains, as a means of laying the foundation for startup s and enterprises to build  applications and services which are tailor -made to the Indian context, and in the process lowering entry  barriers for startup s and academia while also encouraging international expertise to focus on problems  in the Indian context.   In areas such as native language NLP (Natural Lang uage Processing) for diverse Indian languages, for  example, the funding for creation of these data sets can add incremental value to existing services across  many domains, ranging from e -commerce to agricultural advisory. Co -funding by the government would   also enable enforcing of standards across development of data sets, and allow interoperability at a large  scale. A collaborative approach w here the g overnment acts as a catalyst is recommended as a way  forward .   Recommendation 3 : Partnerships and collaboration   AI is a highly collaborative domain, and any framework aimed at promoting AI needs to be aligned  accordingly. A multi -pronged approach, involving various stakeholders and promoting a collaborative  approach is required for promoting developmen t of AI tools as well as adoption of AI in different fields of  activity.   Perkmann and Walsh (2007) studied different degrees  of partnership in research and categorised them  in three categories, each having different characteristics.   Figure 28 : Categories o f partnerships in Research     In India, Academic Entrepreneurship is being taken up through mechanis ms such as the development of  dedicated e -cells in institutions such as IIT Bombay, IIT Madras and IIM Ahmedabad, among others. Low  degrees of partnership , such as direct transfer of knowledge , is being taken up by MNCs and startup s  that make use of scientific publications and informal interaction to develop. Research partnerships are  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     76    also being explored, but in a very limited capacity. Other partnership mecha nisms, however, are all but  absent.   (h) Collaboration between Research Organi sations is required to promote the ‘AI+X’ paradigm where  the AI researcher works in close collaboration with the researcher in other domains like healthcare,  manufacturing, agricultu re, etc. Several successful US universities have co -located departments  which enabled close collaboration. DARPA in the USA has close linkages with research facilities  housed in academic institutions, and has taken up major initiatives for promoting resear ch and  innovation in collaboration with private enterprises and startup s alike. In India these domains are not  naturally connected, primarily due to the structural nature of both academia and research labs.  To  promote AI in the country, and fully realise the ‘AI+X’ paradigm, it is also necessary to enable such  cross -sectoral collaboration, e.g. between a medical doctor and a computer scientist, to lead research  for application of latest technology in solving medical problems and also making real data avail able  in the process.   (i) Industry -Research Collaboration  is required to help continuously scale and improve the initial  research output based on user feedback from the market. For example, in the domain of search  engines , several search datasets like TREC, SMA RT, etc. were made available by the US universities  during the 1970 -80s to develop the technology of information retrieval and search. This in turn led to  development of several search engines such as Yahoo! and Alta Vista during this period. Over time ,  this led to improved smarter systems until Google became the market leader in the late 1990s.   (j) Collaboration with trade bodies and Venture Capitals is essential for successful functioning  of a  profitable business which involves various other elements , like deriving the optimal business model,  managing human resources, advertisement  / marketing and many varied functions depending upon  the type of technology and underlying business. Trade bodies and associations are very important  for collaborating with  other  people in similar businesses , as they can share information about the  common problems, possible solutions and access to learning from the ground. Such bodies help in  collectively identifying new international markets for such products  / technologies and i n  lobbying/negotiating for favourable trade norms with the national and international bodies.   Recommendation 4 : Spreading awareness on the advantages AI offers   Another major hurdle in adoptio n is low visibility for  the work being done across the country. U nless  known through networks, work is often duplicated without knowledge of previous work done in the area  and consultation with experts. There is a need for an AI Database on an online portal for registered people  to access and find this information. This  database, primar ily managed by the government, c ould serve as  a single source of truth for experts and projects being implemented. The resources can include details  like researchers stating their expertise , and professionals with hands -on experience on de veloping AI  solutions  showcasing their credentials . This knowledge base can also become a forum for sharing various  discussion related to research collaboration, and finding relevant collaborators and finding professionals  to deliver on AI projects.   There is need to make senior level officials among government agencies, public sector undertakings, and  other domestic firms aware of the numerous advantages that AI offers, by organising workshops and live  demonstrations of possible AI applications and how its implementation can help augment the human  workforce, rather than displace it. The constitution of an annual ‘AI Readiness Index’ may also be  considered, as highlighted in the DIPP Task Force report on Artificial Intelligence. This may also be further  expan ded to highlight best practices across states, to be shared in various fora. NITI Aayog, given its  mandate of competitive and cooperative federalism, could undertake this task.  It has already collaborated 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     77    with organisations such as Google to organise capac ity building training and workshops for government  functionaries .   Recommendation 5 : Supporting startup s  Startup s and smaller firms are the engine for growth in a dynamic evolving economy like India, and are  constrained in the AI space, thus requiring targ eted government interventions.    (a) Incubation hubs specifically for AI startup s in collaboration with State Governments and private sector  stakeholders need to be set up to provide space, and other infrastructure facilities for new startup s  to incubate along with interacting with other startup s at various levels of maturity in order to interact  and provide advice.   (b) Establishment of fund to provide grant funding to startup s to facilitate their operation and business.  This should be aimed at assisting startup s to sustain the initial years of business when they are  unable to generate venture capital funds or have to sacrifice a large share of the business for early  stage seed f unds .   Proposed modules of the National AI Marketplace (NAIM)   It is proposed that the marketplace , called here as National AI Marketplace (NAIM),  be divided into 3  distinct modules, at least in early stages of development. These are as follows:   a) Data  market place   b) Data  annotation marketplace   c) Deployable  model marketplace  / Solutions marketplace   The AI development value chain, discussed above, is supported by these three modular marketplaces in  terms of easing collaboration, reducing time and cost of collecting & annotating data, and bringing multiple  solutions deployment at one place for scale and network effect.   Figure 29: Enablers for AI value chain     The marketplace mechanism being proposed here will be aimed at easing the adoption efforts of all  participants – private enterprises, PSUs, governments, startups and academia. A common platform which  brings together enterprises and AI solution builders will trigger off the initial collaboration towards building  AI solutions and adopting them at scale.     
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     78    Figure 30 : Stakeholders for the proposed NAIM     Data marketplace   Today, incumbents continue to enjoy an oligopoly in building sustainable business models i n AI for two  main reasons: (a) t hey can successfully buy data in the informal market setting due to availability of  resources and reach to negotiate one -time contracts continually , and (b) they have speciali sed  departments to work on different facets of the development value chain. In the process of informal data  acquisition as well, there is no proper p rice discovery mechanism in place. Compounded with the issue  of a huge asymmetry of information in the sector between data providers and buyers, data providers are  likely to be substantially unde rpaid.   This further compounds the problem of data access and  thwarts the creation of a healthy marketplace as  well as incentives. In a formal marketplace being proposed here, new entrants in the AI model creation  /  training space will find it easier to raise resources for buying data. This will be due to VCs having  enough  information to verify the funding demands and a lower risk resulting from a more level playing field and  equita ble access to new data sources.   While data has been compared to oil ad nauseam, there are a few differences which must be highlighted:   a) Reusability : Copied data is as valuable as the ‘original ’. Therefore, traceability of ownership is a  challenge for a viable marketplace model where the originators of the data should get compensated  from resale of the data.   b) Compounding value : Unlike oil, the  value of a dataset increases not just with quantity but also  structural complexity. For example, the value of a health dataset of a million individuals and an  education dataset of the same individuals is more than the sum of its parts because of the value   added by the connections between the different  elements. Therefore, it is difficult to quantify the value  of new datasets as it is dependent on the existing datasets one has and how one plans to connect  the new data with the existing data.   
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     79      c) Permanence : Unlike the oil , the inventory of data continually increases with time. However, this raises  the complexity in transporting larger and larger datasets.     d) Ubiquit y: Since data is ubiquitous and continually increasing in quantity, it follows that a way to  automa tically curate new datasets is needed so that any market does not overwhelm users with  outdated or irrelevant data.     The fundamental properties of data and its collection outlined above create challenges which make the  creation of a centrali sed data market place difficult. The primary assumption of a data marketplace in  operation is that data custodians will share the data on the marketplace. Organisations may be reluctant  to do so. Further, the operations of the data exchange, financially sustained by trans action fees and rigid  pricing models, also add to inefficiencies and discourage data sharing.   Features of a viable data marketplace – how it can be implemented?   To incentivi se a larger supply of AI training data sets and services, it is necessary to ensure availability  of data, an audit trail mechanism to curb reselling of the same data, and ways to address security and  privacy concerns. One solution is to have a centrali sed, trusted party to host the data on behalf of data  providers and enforce the rules of the game. However, this is not practical for a variety of reasons, not  the least because most data providers will not agree to let a replicable resource such as data be stor ed  somewhere else, but also because of co st, control and trust concerns.   A more effective way to address these concerns is a decentrali sed data marketplace that is based on  blockchain technology.   The exchange platform should have the following features fo r data providers to share data:   a) Traceability,   b) Access Controls ,   c) Compliance with local and international regulations , and  d) Robust price  discovery mechanism for data     The proposed data exchange marketplace will attract data providers and model builders  / trainers to build  AI products. The process of exchange, with enforced provisions of privacy and anonymi sation, brings a  market determined value to data and thus forces the existing informal data exchange economy, without  any privacy protection, to move tow ards a formal economy.   The g overnment can establish a committee of experts, researchers, AI developers and regulators to  create the standards the data marketplace will adhere by and explore how can it be put in implementation.   The unique approach that on e such initiative, i.e., Ocean Protocol has taken is to create what they call a  Proofed Curation Market with two subcomponents: (a) Data exchange validation on blockchain, (b) Data  curation market based on a derivative token. The former lays out a mechanis m for data and value  exchange, the latter enables the market to decide which datasets are important and creates an incentive  for even free data to be put on the platform. Essentially, data consumers can bet on the viability of even  free data and thereby ea rn money.   See Appendix III  for more on data ecosystems as enablers.   Data annotation marketplace   Of the three marketplace modules defined, the data annotation marketpla ce is perhaps the most mature.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     80    Given the large costs associated with the annotation exercise, a popular mechanism that has emerged  is that of crowdsourcing using un -trained or non -expert anonymous annotators on the internet. Though  this gives rise to its own set of challenges, it may be considered a solution to the problem of cheaply and  quickly acquiring annotations for the purposes of constructing a variety of models. To understand the  potential of crowdsourcing, consider the observation of a research paper in 200439: a crowd of 5,000  people playing an appropriately designed computer game  24 hours a day, could be made to label all  images on Google (425,000,000 images in 2005 ) in a matter of just 31 days.   However, some challenges that emerge in the annotation crowdsourcing process are as follows.   a) Creation  of verification mechanisms : Depend ence on untrained professionals gives rise to issues in  ensuring high accuracy in annotation and thus potentially higher accuracy of the trained algorithm.  Verification mechanisms such as multiple annotation, verification of samples by trained professional s,  etc. are some of the ways to solve this problem.     b) Establishing  verified traceability: Mechanisms must thus be put in place to identify poor annotators,  and create mechanisms to reduce the effect of error generated.     Features of a data annotation marketp lace – how it can be implemented?   Platforms such as Amazon’s MTurks, Figure -Eight (previously known as CrowdFlower) or ClickWorker  are perhaps the most popular crowd -sourced annotation platforms. Each allows for building of  mechanisms of verification such as multiple annotations, creation of test cases, sample verification by  professionals, etc. to inc rease accuracy of annotations.   Analysis indicates that most annotation tasks can be categori sed on the basis of sensitivity to expertise  of annotators. This is defined as the degree to which annotator expertise can affect the accuracy of  annotation. The figure  below considers how approaches to the annotation process could differ with  changing nature of the task.   Figure 31 : Approaches to annotation   Sensitivity to  degree of expertise  Example of task    Motivation    Potential  annotators  Verification mechanism     Low Classification of  object in  presented image  GWAP, ML,  ALTR  General  population  Multiple annotations   High Classification of  medical scans  ML College students,  professionals,  Multiple annotations,  Verification by professionals   GWAP = Games with a purpose, ML = Mechani sed labor for financial incentives, ALTR = Altruistic motivation   Simple object classification or regional language translation are examples of tasks that have low barriers  to annotator expertise. However, tasks such  as classification of medical images, requires robust  mechanisms to verify annotations, and also ensure verified traceability  to identify poor annotators, and  create mechanisms to reduce the effect of error generated.   In India, vast public datasets are av ailable at organi sations such as ISRO (India Space Research  Organi sation), ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research), All India Radio (AIR) and NIC (National                                                         39 Luis von Ahn and Laura Dabbish , 2004, Labeling images  with a computer game 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     81    Informatics Center) among others, but are unfortunately largely unused due to lack of proper annotation,  prohibitive cost associated with the process, and  lack of proper mechanisms for acquis ition. It is  envisaged that these  datasets be used to  create initial corpora of data sets, and encourage enterprise  action in the area. A crowdsourced platform  for annotation, on the lines of the highly popular government’s  citizen participation platform myGov.in , can be established by the government (to be operated by a private  player) where seed data for annotation can be provided by the organisations mentioned above.   Deployable Model Marketplace   Given the level of market for AI tools, AI -as-a-Service business model, and a plethora of standardi sed  problems faced by enterprises at scale, a deployable model segment in the marketplace, which  brings  together the buyers and suppliers of AI solutions, can greatly ease and expedite the adoption of AI. It  would give visibility to the existing solutions, address information asymmetry and generate awareness  amongst the relevant constituents. This AI -as-a-Service model segment would further build upon and  synergi se with the previous two layers of the marketplace model viz. data and annotation.   Many objectives aimed to be achieved by AI algorithms can now be categori sed as standardi sed  problems. The fo llowing are some of the standardi sed and ubiquitous  problems most of organi sations  face in their activity streams:   a) object detection in images or video streams;   b) conversational smart chatbots (text and speech);   c) speech -to-text and text -to-speech;   d) assistive diagnostic solutions;   e) language recognition and transcription;   f) contextual data mining to discover complex patterns;   g) price optimi sation;  h) data collection, curation and annotation for specific business use;   i) supply and demand forecasting; and   j) server, app and w eb uptime/downtime prediction .    Here models refer to the weights of the AI model trained on the data , which contains the predictive power.  The inferencing of the model will require integration with other IT stacks and will be a customi sed process.  Hence, t his module of the marketplace should focus on defined deployable models that can be bought or  sold. These models could either be bought and sold as data, or more likely, as a service or an API layer  that can be charged per use.   The model marketplace will a ttract enterprises which can post problems which they are seeking to be  solved using AI tools. Governments can be another party to announce specific problems which they  intend to be solved. This demand side will be supported by the community of AI solution  developers  (consisting of startups, enterprises, individual researchers etc.) who will either showcase their existing  developed and tested product suites, or customise their products as per the demand placed by  enterprises. Academic researchers will be an other major beneficiary of the marketplace as they will get  valuable insights about problems faced by the industry and will get access to real industry data.           
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     82    Figure 32 : Stakeholders of NAIM     Challenges to adoption of a marketplace model for AI models  are as follows:   a) Ensuring quality : Marketplaces require continuous monitoring and maintenance of quality. For  example, Amazon enforces this on vendors, and this goes beyond user ratings. Continuous scrutiny  of products, sellers and buyers will be required.   b) Responsive product development required : The correct set of features of this platform will have to be  discovered through iteration and adaptation, since there isn ’t precedent of such AI platforms to draw  from. The platform should allow for trial based access to models to allow for iterative product  evaluation by buyers.   c) Sophistication of PSUs for data sharing and evaluation against specs:  If data is to be provided over  the platform, solution -seekers will need to know how to provide clean datasets, balan ce data to  sufficiently represent infrequent occurrences, hide test data for evaluation of solutions while sharing  training data, define appropriate specs, decide on appropriate evaluation methods, etc. The platform  should be able to prescribe some basic s tandards for data sharing which will allow non -ML savvy  PSUs to post problems and data.   d) Incentives for seeding network effect : The marketplace needs a certain critical mass of solution  seekers and providers for gaining traction, to subsequently trigger net work effects. This is true of all  marketplaces. Incentives to attract both seekers and providers initially will need to be figured out.  PSUs and government agencies may act as initial seeders/users of the platform with right incentives  and mandates.   e) Poten tially rich feature set needed for adoption:  Such platforms can work well when there are systems  like a credible rating system, payment escrow, search and sort to aid discovery, recommendation  engines, etc. These will need to be established at NAIM also.   How can the stakeholders engage in NAIM?   NAIM, as a marketplace for enterprises, will encourage all business entities, government agencies,  startups, AI researchers, system integrators and academic research institutions to sign up on the  platform. Followin g may look like a snapshot of the marketplace where all the stakeholders engage in  their respective activities on the platform:   
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     83    Private / public sector enterprises   a) Hospitals: assistive diagnostics for physicians and radiologists .  b) Distribution companies: pr edict peak load, identify default prone customers .  c) Travel and tourism: predict peak traffic routes, pricing optimi sation customers, offer alternative  routes/modes for traffic optimization.   d) Large industrial or real estate establishments: smart power managem ent, utilities management, real time failure detection and analysis .  e) Cinema: automated subtitles in regional languages (speech -to-text and translation) .  Government authorities   a) Traffic authorities and police: real -time object detection in CCTV video feeds, face detection and  object tracking, number plate detection .  b) Citizen engagement: conversational chatbots (speech and text) in Indic languages for grievance  redressal and query management .  c) Document analysis and management: text recognition and sentiment anal ysis from physical  documents, analysis and summary .  d) All India Radio and Prasar Bharti: speech -to-text services for transcription and analysis .  e) Road and rail transport: face and eye movement detection (at the edge) for analysing driver fatigue  and alarm sig nal, freight route optimization.   f) Agriculture: crop health and soil health analysis through remote sensing and IoT, farmer advisory  services for input control and market demand prediction .  AI Solution Providers   a. India AI startups: solutions for natural language processing and Indic languages, diagnostic  assistants, image recognition/object detection .  b. Industrial Internet -of-Things: capturing data from machines and providing insights in areas of energy  management, retail and inventory management .  c. On Edge A I devices: CCTV video feed monitoring and warning signals .  d. Academic Research Institutions .  e. Centers of Excellence:  access to industry data for various use cases, model training and evaluation .  Box 19 : Why the focus on PSUs   Private enterprises run on the bas is of market conditions and business drivers of revenues and profits.  Due to either absence of markets or failure of efficient markets, many sectors of operation of PSUs are  for achieving socio -economic goals of equality and distribution of wealth. There i s not much incentive for  PSUs for improving operational efficiency; they are further constrained by regulations imposed on publicly  funded entities in activities of procurement, manpower hiring etc.   Technology adoption, especially AI, can significantly im prove operational efficiency and drive down  operational costs incurred by PSUs operating in financially unsustainable but socially critical areas. This 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     84    improvement in operational costs will make them financially more viable. The NAIM allows the public sector firms to directly scout for solutions which they can use in their business operations by significantly  easing their information search for solutions. Additionally, PSUs and government agencies can also be  the first driver of the network of the NAIM wher e initial pool of problems and industry data is shared by  them which will attract several solution developers, especially startups and researchers to sign up for the  platform .  Mechanisms to reali se marketplace model   It is proposed that a decentrali sed data  marketplace based on distributed ledger technology be set up. In  the future , such a platform can enable advanced privacy preserv ing AI techniques such as multi -party  computation directly on individual pieces of data.   Instead of attempting to build such ma rketplaces, which it is not equipped to do  so, the government  should come out with enabling regulations , such that these marketplaces can be set up by private players.  These would include regulations and standard permissions for any personal data being sol d, standards  for anonymi sation, standards for ensuring annotation accuracy, and cybersecurity standards for the  module dealing with deployable model s.   An ini tial effort may be made by the g overnment to build the NAIM platform where all relevant  stakeholde rs can sign up. However, open market competition will allow other marketplace operators to  come in with innovative services and up -to-date data on suppliers and buyers on the marketplace. NAIM  will lead to a more engaging collaboration, quicker and easier data access and accelerated adoption of  AI among enterprises and public authorities in the country.   
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     85       Ethics, Privacy, Security and Artificial  Intelligence    Towards a “Responsible AI”     AI is going to be the tipping point in technological evolution of mankind , with human dependence on  machines and algorithms for decision making never been such deep. Thus , any strategy document on  promoting AI, necessarily needs to be conscious of the probable factors of the AI ecosystem that may  undermine ethical conduc t, impinge on one’s privacy and undermine the security protocol. Appropriate  steps to mitigate these risks need to be an integral part of any such strategy.   While the issue of ethics would concern the biases that an AI system can propagate, the privacy co ncerns  are largely on collection and inappropriate use of data for personal discrimination. Issue of securit y arises  from the implications and the consequent accountability of any AI system.   While addressing the above issues, one needs to be conscious of t he potential vulnerabilities of our  extant regulatory and societal structures which are dependent on human judgment and control , and thus  subject to inherent biases and discrimination. Thus , to say that extant decision making systems –  individual, societal , regulatory or even judicial – are entirely devoid of these shortcomings would be a  fallacy as these are dependent upon human limitations of knowledge, precedent, rationale and bias  (explicit or subconscious). Delegation of some aspects of that decision m aking to algorithms, which may  well be able to ingest and process many more parameters as compared to a human, may likely result in  systems with reduced bias, discrimination and improved privacy protection. However, even if a  technological intervention hel ps us delegate that responsibility to an algorithm with improved outcomes,  it is extremely important that we set much higher standards for privacy and protection in case of AI tools.   Ethics and AI   Fairness / tackling the biases AI  Based on the premise that  a large set of well -diversified data may be an accurate description of the world,  most of the developer community takes a technocratic attitude that data -driven decision making is good  and algorithms are neutral. However, this argument does not recogni se the fact that the existing data  may have biases, which may have got reinforced over time. The issue of fairness is at the forefront of  discussion in academic, research and policy fora, and definitely merits a combined dialogue and  sustained research to com e to an acceptable resolution. One possible way to approach this would be to  identify the in -built biases and assess their impact, and in turn find ways to reduce the bias. This reactive  approach, use -case based, may help till the time we find techniques t o bring neutrality to data feeding AI  solutions, or build AI solutions that ensure neutrality despite inherent biases.   Transparency / opening the “Black Box ”  Presently, most AI solutions suffer from what is commonly known as the “Black Box Phenomenon”, wit h  very little or no understanding of what happens in between and only the input data and results being the  known factors. This is due to the reliance in most current AI systems to incrementally improve the  performance as defined by a narrow set of paramete rs, with developer’s emphasis being less on how the 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     86    algorithms are achieving the requisite success. However, calls for explaining the decision -making  process will gain momentum as AI systems are increasingly relied upon for decision making that has  signifi cant consequences for a large section of population.   Opening the Black Box, assuming it is possible and useful at this stage (there is considerable debate on  that as well), should not aim towards opening of code or technical disclosure – few clients of AI  solutions  would be sophisticated AI experts - but should rather aim at “ explainability ”. With extended disclosure  though, what needs to be balanced is whether the algorithm’s parameter may induce the individuals and  companies to change their behavior and in turn game the system. Clearly, more collaborative research  is required in this area.    Box 19 : Decoding Explainable AI   Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an evolving area of research which has received a lot of attention  from the research commu nity and the broader society alike. XAI project by DARPA is one such project  which has shown substantial progress in explaining how and why machine learning algorithms work in a   certain way. The aim of the XAI  project, as described by DARPA is:   The Explainable AI (XAI) program aims to create a suite of machine learning techniques that:   • Produce more explainable models, while maintaining a high  level of learning performance ; and   • Enable human users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively  manage the emerging  generation of artificially intelligent partners.   The machine learning algorithms of tomorrow should have the built -in capability to explain their logic,  enumerate their strengths and weaknesses and specify an understanding of their future behavior.   Figure 33 : XAI Concept     XAI is one of a handful of cur rent DARPA programs expected to enable “third -wave AI systems”, where  machines understand the context and environment in which they operate, and over time build underlying  explanatory models that allow them to characteri se real world phenomena.    In May 201 8, XAI researchers are expected to demonstrate initial implementations of their explainable  learning systems and conduct pilot studies of their Phase 1 evaluations. Full Phase 1 system evaluations  are expected in November 2018 .  Credit : DARPA Explainable Ar tificial Intelligence (XAI)   
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     87    Privacy and AI   AI models, solutions and their application depend on generation, collection and processing of large  amounts of data on individual, entity and community behaviour. Data collection without proper consent,  privacy of  personal data, inherent selection biases and resultant risk of profiling and discrimination, and  non-transparent nature of AI solutions are some of the issues requiring deliberation and proper recourse.   However, the current debate on data usage have two distinct aspects. Firstly, there are concerns that  companies are harvesting significant amounts of consumer data and using it inappropriately to gain  insights about consumers. Key here is that the consumer may not have access to these insights or the  ability to derive value from them. Beyond compliance, companies can consider how to create awareness  of how they use consumer information and the value they provide in return, which can build trust in their  brand and services.   Secondly, there are concerns that companies are amassing large data sets and thereby building an unfair  competitive advantage. Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value without the ability to extract  meaning from them. The dataset is a necessary, but not the only, component of delive ring meaningful  insights from data. Having the tools to analyse it and the experience to understand its meaning are the  others. While those that have access to large datasets and by the nature of their business models have  data network effects, which enabl es them in turn to build a first mover advantage when it comes to  perfecting their algorithms and driving business value, this does not necessarily negatively impact the  consumer.   Dealing with privacy issues   a. Establish a data protection framework with legal  backing : The work being done by Justice  Srikrishna Committee on data protection law is very opportune and timely. The 7 -core principles  of data protection and privacy – informed consent, technology agnosticism, data controller  accountability, data minimisation, holistic application, deterrent penalties and structured  enforcement – are quite comprehensive and should provide a strong privacy protection regime  in the countr y once enacted.   b. Establish sectoral regulatory frameworks : Apart from having a central privacy protection law, due  to diverse and fast changing nature of the technology, sectoral regulatory frameworks may also  act as additional protection to user privacy a nd security. Japan and Germany have developed  new frameworks applicable to specific AI issues such as regulating next generation robots and  self-driving cars respectively.   c. Benchmark national data protection and privacy laws with international standards : European  Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines, which have been enforced in  May 2018, encourage design of less -privacy invasive systems. French laws give a right to  explanation for administrative algorithmic decisions, making it much more comprehensive than  GDPR on administrative decisions. India’s privacy protection regime will have to be continually  updated to reflect understanding of new risks and their impact.   d. Encourage AI developers to adhere to international standards : Leaders a nd practitioners from  across the world have come together to frame standards for safe and privacy preserving AI. The  Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems of the IEEE has a chapter on  ‘Personal Data and Individual Access Control  in Ethically Aligned Design’. Indian enterprises and  developers need to build these standards into AI design itself.   e. Encourage self -regulation : Data Privacy Impact Assessment Tools can be used by AI developers  and enterprises adopting AI solutions to mana ge privacy risks.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     88    f. Invest and collaborate in privacy preserving AI research : New mathematical models for  preserving privacy are being researched upon where risks of data exploitation and personal  identification (from an anonymi sed dataset) can be reduced b y limiting information one can gain  from released data, irrespective of amount of side information available otherwise. India should  collaborate on areas of research like Differential Privacy, Privacy by Design, Safety -Critical AI  and Multi -Party Computati ons which enable protection of privacy despite data sharing at a wide  scale.   g. Spread awareness : Privacy has been termed as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court of  India. The protection of this right with its multiple facets in a fast -changing technolog ical  environment will not just depend on State enforcement b ut by also making the citizens aware of  their rights and how they can protect them. People often unknowingly give consent to sharing  their data which they would not have ordinarily done had they k nown the purpose their data were  being put to. There is an urgent need to spread awareness among the individuals about the  importance of consent, ethics and privacy while dealing with technology. A pan -India campaign  in multiple languages, and inclusion of  privacy rights in school and college curriculum can serve  as effective mass outreach mediums to spread awareness.   Box 20 : Differential Privacy   A concept developed by Cynthia Dwork in 2006, Differential Privacy aims at preserving identifiable user  informat ion irrespective of any outside information the aggregator agency holds. The dilemma of giving  personali sed service to users based on their individuali sed preferences while at the same time ensuring  that user is not uniquely identifiable, using the data co llected or any other public data, is not solved by  traditional privacy preserving methods of cryptography. Differential privacy describes a promise, made  by a data holder, or curator, to a data subject: “You will not be affec ted, adversely or otherwise, by   allowing your data to be used in any study or analysis, no matter what other studies, data sets, or  information sources, are available.” It addresses the paradox of learning nothing about an individual while  learning useful information about a population.   Security in AI   The accountability debate on AI, which in most of the cases today is aimed at ascertaining the liability,  needs to be shifted to objectively identifying the component that failed and how to prevent that in the  future. An analogy can be drawn to how the air lines have become a relatively safe industry today. Every  accident has been elaborately investigated, and future course of action has been determined. Something  similar is needed to ensure safe AI.  One possible framework that can be mooted involves the fol lowing components:   a. Negligence test for damages caused by AI software, as opposed to strict liability. This involves  self-regulation by the stakeholders by conducting damage impact a ssessment at every stage of  development of an AI model.   b. As an extension o f the negligence test, safe harbo urs need to be formulated to insulate or limit  liability so long as appropriate steps to design, test, monitor, and improve the AI product have  been taken.   c. Framework for apportionment of damages need to be developed so that  the involved parties bear  proportionate liability, rather than joint and several liability, for harm caused by products in which 
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     89    the AI is embedded, especially where the use of AI was unexpected, prohibited, or inconsistent  with permitted use cases.   d. Actua l harm requirements policy may be followed, so that a lawsuit cannot proceed based only  on a speculative damage or a fear of future damages.   India can also take a leaf out of UK’s playbook, where GBP 9 million is being invested to establish a new  Centre for  Data Ethics and Innovation, aimed at enabling and ensuring ethical, safe and innovative uses  of data, including AI. This will include engaging with industry to explore the possibilities of establishing  data trusts to facilitate easy and secure sharing of data. A consortium of Ethics Councils at each Centre  of Excellence may be set up to define the standard practice (on the lines of OpenAI charter). It would be  expected that all Centres of Excellence adhere to standard practices while developing AI technolo gy and  products.     
      
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     91       Actions for the Government   Achieving the goal of #AIforAll requires long term and engaged institutional collaboration between all  the stakeholders including the citizens.

Machine l earning algorithms detect patterns and learn how to make predictions and recommendations  by processing data and experiences, rather than by receiving explicit programming instruction. The  algorithms also adapt in response to new data and experiences to improve efficacy over time.                                                                 40 Replicated from McKinsey Analytics An Executive G uide to AI

An algorithm uses training  data and feedback from  humans to learn the  relationship of given  inputs to a given output  (e.g., how the inputs “time  of year” and “interest  rates” predict housing  prices)  An algorithm explores input  data without being given an  explicit output variable  (e.g., explores customer  demographic data to  identify patterns)  An algorithm learns to  perform a task simply by  trying to maximi se rewards  it receives for its actions  (e.g., maximi ses points it  receives for increasing  returns of an investment  portfolio)   When to  use it?  You know how to classify  the input data and the  type of behavior you want  to predict, but you need  the algorithm to calculate  it for you on new data  You do not know how to  classify the data, and you  want the algorithm to find  patterns and classify the  data for you  You don’t have a lot of  training data; you cannot  clearly define the ideal end  state;  or the only way to  learn about the  environment is to interact  with it   How it  works?  1. A human labels every  element of the input  data (e.g., in the case  of predicting housing  prices, labels the input  data as “time of year,”  “interest rates,” etc.)  and defines the output  variable (e.g., housing  prices)   2. The algorithm is  trained on the data to  find the connection  between the input  variables and the  output   3. Once training is  complete – typically  when the alg orithm is  sufficiently accurate –  the algorithm is  applied to new data  1. The algorithm receives  unlabeled data (e.g., a  set of data describing  customer journeys on a  website)   2. It infers a structure from  the data   3. The algorithm identifies  groups of data that  exhibit similar behavior  (e.g., forms clusters of  customers that exhibit  similar buying  behaviors)  1. The algorithm takes an  action on the  environment (e.g.,  makes a trade in a  financial portfolio)   2. It receives a reward if  the action brings the  machine a step closer  to maximis ing the total  rewards available (e.g.,  the highest total return  on the portfolio)   3. The algorithm optimi ses  for the best series of  actions by correcting  itself over time        
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     99    Deep Learning: a definition   Deep learning is a type of machine learning that can process a wider range of data resources, requires  less data preprocessing by humans, and can often produce more accurate results t han traditional  machine learning approaches. In deep learning, interconnected layers of software -based calculators  known as “neurons” form a neural network.  The network can ingest vast amounts of input data and  process them through multiple layers that learn increasingly complex features of the data at each layer.  The network can then make a determination about the data, learn if its determination is correct,  and use  what it has learned to make determinations about new data. For example, once it learns what an object  looks like, it can recogni se the object in a new image.

The CNN can now classify a different  image as the letter “A” if it finds in it  the unique features previously  identified as making up the letter  Predicting the next word in the  sentence “Are you free …..?”   1. A recurrent neural network (RNN)  neuron receives a command that  indicates the start of a sentence   2. The neuron receives the word “Are”  and then outputs a vector of  numbers that feeds back into the  neuron to help it “remember” tha t it  received “Are” (and that it received it  first). The same process occurs  when it receives “you” and “free,”  with the state of the neuron updating  upon receiving each word   3. After receiving “free,” the neuron  assigns a probability to every word  in the English vocabulary that could  complete the sentence. If trained  well, the RNN will assign the word  “tomorrow” one of the highest  probabilities and will choose it to  complete the sentence        
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     101    Appendix I I: Global Country Strategy Review41   What is happening a round the world in AI?     Countries around the world are becoming increasingly aware of the potential economic and social  benefits of developing and applying AI. For example, China and U.K. estimate that 26% and 10%  of their  GDPs respectively in 2030 will be sourced from AI -related acti vities and businesses. There have  been  tremendous activity concerning AI policy positions and the development of an AI ecosystem in different  countrie s over the last 18 to 24 month – the US A published its AI report in December 2016; France  published the AI strategy in January 2017 followed by a detail ed policy document in March 2018 ; Japan  released a document in March 2017; China published the AI strategy in July 2017; and the U.K. rele ased  its industrial strategy in November 2017.   Governments are reviewing and developing their position  on the following areas to rapidly grow AI  ecosystems:   a) Trigger demand in socially relevant sectors  / segments   b) Gear up t he supply side to fulfil demand – infrastructure (including data ecosystem, data stacks,  high speed computing, etc.), talent, research   c) Set up an enabling system —governance, funding, partnerships   Trigger demand in socially relevant sectors   Different countries have identified different focus  areas fo r AI development and deployment:    a) the USA: a reas of interest include economic prosperity, educational opportunities, quality of life,  national and homeland security. The USA  is focusing on growing the AI ecosystem through public  spending on contra cts, e.g., the US Department of Defens e spent over USD 2.4 billion  on AI related technology in 2017 (2x increase from 2015) .  b) China: a reas of interest include education, healthcare, energy, transport, quality of life, city  planning  /IoT / robotics. China is focusing on developing and using AI for delivery of public  services through financial support, developing talent pipeline, and leveraging international  cooperation.   c) Japan: a reas of interest include industrial productivity improvement, healthcare, medical c are  and welfare, mobility and information security. Japan is focusing on moving from the "Industry  4.0" paradigm to "Society 5.0" through the development of AI use cases for delivering public  services.   d) France: a reas of interest include healthcare, environm ent, transport mobility, defence -security.  The government is planning to support AI startup s through data availability, public spending and  talent reskilling.                                                          41 Source: McKinsey  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     102    e) U.K.: a reas of interest include services, life sciences, agriculture and public -sector applicatio ns.  The government is focused on growing innovative tech firms and making deals with the private  sector to solve AI use -cases for delivery of public services.   Gear up the supply side to fulfil demand   Infrastructure   Most governments have taken the following two action steps, in varying degrees of engagement, to  upgrade infrastructure and build a data ecosystem:   a) Creation of a data -solutions marketplace   b) Invest in upgrading computing infrastructure, 5G networks, etc.   Many countries have been reviewing a range of initiatives to facilitate creation of these marketplaces and  upgrading computing infrastructure as well as connectivity. For example:   a) U.K. is exploring the feasibility of creating data trusts where the process o f data sharing and  storage is underwritten by the government. There is also a focus on defining data rights for  potential participants on the platform . There are plans to invest GBP 1 billion  to upgrade digital  infrastructure including rolling out 5G and fu ll-fibre networks.   b) Japan has announced expanding its R&D tax exemption to include AI and big data as well as  subsidies for building new robots with integrated AI. Its focus is on developing sector -specific  platforms for public and private development of A I, followed by interlinking of different platforms  to create an integrated AI ecosystem.   c) France is trying to streamline its innovation track with "innovation sandboxes" which would  provide an open platform for innovation and offer resources for use in fie ld-testing, etc. AI  research institutes would have supercomputers specifically designed for AI usage and devoted  to researchers and their economic partners during their shared initiatives.   d) China is focused on developing open source innovation platforms in  partnership with private  players like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. Funding is available for 5G networks to enable  "intelligenti sation" and deployment of supercomputers, high performance semiconductor chips  for AI use.    e) the USA  is facilitating the creatio n of open source software libraries and toolkits, e.g., Open NLP,  Weka toolkit, etc.   Talent   Countries are also significantly increasing allocation of resources for STEM  talent development through  investment in universiti es, mandating new courses (e.g.  AI and law), and offering schemes to retrain  people.   a) U.K. is planning to increase its R&D spend to 2.7 % of its GDP by 2027, investing GBP 42 million   in teacher development and GBP64 million  in the retraining scheme including digital training.  They are pla nning to make it easier for Tier -1 applicants working on AI subjects to obtain work  permits and have a path to residency. They are also planning to build over 1,000 government  supported PhD institutions by 2025 and set up a Turing fellowship to support an initial cohort of  AI fellows.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     103    b) France is trying to triple the number of AI graduates in three years by offering new courses and  doubling the starting salary of researchers in public institutions. They also want to attract talent  from across the world by of fering substantial salary hikes, supporting improvements in the quality  of life and reducing administrative formalities. Further, France and the US have labs and panels  to assess the impact of AI on the workforce.   c) U.S. is p lanning a USD 200 million  grant for STEM education focusing on co mputer science  matched by a USD 300 million  industry grant.   d) Japan has convened a “ national consultative body ” with 3 universities and the Japan business  foundation to develop education programs for reskilling.   e) China  has launched a five -year university program to train at least 500 teachers and 5,000  students working on AI technologies. The program is a collaboration between government  bodies, private companies and universities including Sinovation Ventures. China has  set in  motion a plan to develop 50 world -class teaching institutes and research institutions, 50 national level high quality online open courses and 50 AI faculties by 2020 as part of the “AI+X” program.   Research   Universities and research institutions fro m the US A, China and Japan have led the publication volume  on AI research topics between 2010 and 2016. In the US, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU),  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT)  and Stanford are the top three universities in mean count  of pa pers published across AI, systems, theory and interdisciplinary areas42. These universities have  been pioneers of AI research in the US and have more than 100 faculty members across different areas  of AI research.   a) CMU has one of the oldest AI progra ms in t he world – it was also one of the first to offer an  undergraduate program. It has started the CMU AI program which is a collaboration forum for  faculties across seven departments to work on multidisciplinary AI topics.   b) MIT has launched the Intelligence Que st to discover the foundations of human intelligence and  its application to develop technology and tools.   c) Stanford has a AI4ALL program to increase diversity in AI research and education.   These three universities also feature on the top of any list on inf rastructure and industry relations, e.g.,  IBM’s Watson was developed in research collaboration with CMU :                                                         42CSRankings.org

Japanese research has historically been hardware centric with rob otics as one of the major focus areas  of development. With the growing demand for AI, academia in Japan is rapidly reorienting itself to  theoretical and applied research in the sector . Riken Centre for Advanced Intelligence Project and  Advanced Industrial Science and Technology are the nodal research institutes for industry collaboration.   With AI led disruption of multiple industries, it is imperative for traditional industry players to increase  speed and agility of insight generation, design and digiti se customer journeys as well as develop  efficiency in delivering journey transformations. Consequently, traditional players like GE and Merck are  investing heavily to power their  offering through AI interventions .  ▪80+ faculty across 17  research focus areas  ▪Andrew Ng is an adjunct  associate professor for  Machine learning ▪AI4ALL programme to  increase diversity in the field  of AI research▪100+ faculty members  across departments ▪1000+ students engaged in  AI research and education ▪Launched undergrad degree  in AI ▪IBM’s Watson , World  champion robot soccer  players, etc.▪CS & AI lab has 1200+  people working on 900+  projects ▪Research ranges from  algorithm and theory to  applied AI and machine  learning ▪Launched MIT Intelligence  quest to discover the  foundations of human  intelligence and develop tools ▪JD.com ▪Google ▪DiDi ▪Panasonic ▪UST Global ▪Tencent ▪Samsung▪$240 million investment from  IBM for 10 years ▪60+ member companies  across telcos , finance,  consumer electronics▪U.S. department of defence ▪NASA ▪Amazon ▪Google ▪Microsoft ▪OculusResearch and  course -work ▪Stanford AI lab –Toyota  center for AI research▪Computational genomics lab ▪Distributed robotics lab ▪Vision lab▪State of the art robotics  institute ▪AI stack  ▪Design for AI labResearch  facilities Research  partnerships
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     105      Source: Press search   Set up an enabling sy stem   Governance   Most of the governments have established  / utilised existing centrali sed umbrella body for budgetary  planning of AI interventions and for formulating strategy and drafting policies. The National Science and  Technology Cou ncil in the USA , Strategic Council for AI technologies in Japan, AI council in the U.K. are  nodal agencies for planning and designing AI initiatives. These central bodies typically consist of  ministers, representatives from industry and nominated members from academia, e.g ., the UAE has a  Minister of State for AI. Similarly, for implementation and delivery of AI initiatives:   a) U.K. has a dedicated department "Office of AI" to collaborate with multiple departments,  ministries and other stakeholders to deliver AI projects   b) Franc e has a shared specialist centre of 30 members to help provide specific inputs and  implement projects in other departments   c) In China and Japan, individual ministries and departments are responsible for implementing AI  solutions across different sectors. Fo r example,   i. China: National Development and Research Commission, Ministry of Science and  Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Central Military -Civil Fusion  Development Commission Office, the Central Military Commission (CMC) Science and  Technology Commission, and the CMC Equipment Development Department, etc.   ii.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     106    While due i mportance is given to the central planning and implementation entities, the role of local  governments in solving area -specific challenges through application of AI is becoming increasingly  important. For example,   a) London has a Smart City board and a Chief Digital Officer to apply best practices in smart  infrastructure and AI .  b) Over 19 Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Tianjin, have been  mandated to develop their own city -level AI agenda.   Utilising AI -related solutions at the g rass-roots level to solve real local challenges has the potential to  truly democrati se its use.   Funding   Governments are significantly increasing the funding for the AI ecosystem.   a) Apart from the increase in R&D spend to 2.7 % of its GDP, U.K. has created a GBP 725 million   industri al strategy challenge fund, GBP 1.7 billion  for transforming cities fund, reforming  enterprise investment scheme and ventu re capital trusts to unlock GBP 7 billion  over 10 years.  Additiona lly, they have instituted a GBP 2.5 billion  investment fund at the British Business Bank  to incubate tech startup s and reforming rules for pension funds to mandate inclusion of AI in their  investment portfolio.   b) Japan is planning to increase its scien ce and innovation budget by JPY 900 billion  by 2020 f or AI.  Different Japanese ministries are also funding R&D centres, e.g., Ministry of Economy, Trade  and Industry (METI) is funding R&D centres at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial  Science and Technology (AIST).   c) France is planning to spend EUR 1.3 billion  to develop AI -led interventions.   d) China is funding a massive growth in network infrastructure and creating megaprojects.   e) the USA  is increasing its spend on AI -related contracts with the Departmen t of Defense alone  spending USD 2.4 billion . Othe r large spenders include departments of agriculture, veteran affairs  and homeland security.   Private companies have dominated the investment in AI with internal corporate investments as the  biggest mode of spend. Other large sources of funding for startup s within the sector include venture  capital (VC) and private equity (PE). The two biggest areas funded are machine learning and computer  vision, followed by natural language processing, autonomous vehicles and smart robotics.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     108      Source: Press search   Partnerships   These countries are also leveraging different combinations of public -private -academia to develop and  promote AI:   a) In the U.K., a public -private -academia partnership was established as "sector deals" to improve  productivity. The expansion of tech parks thro ugh the tech nation program is also an example of  public -private partnership. The government is also trying to develop regional R&D partnerships  between universities, large corporations and investors in the sector, e.g., BT has partnered with  15 universiti es across the U.K. on creating AI powered, next generation data infrastructure.   b) Japan has instituted new programs to triple research -industry collaboration by 2025 (including  co-locating industry employees with researchers). They have also signed collabora tion pacts with  the US and Israel for technology transfer and joint R&D projects.   c) Japan is trying to foster solutioning of challenges faced by large corporation by connecting them  with startup s, e.g., Japan Open Innovation Council, New Energy and Industrial Technology  Development Organi sation (NEDO) pitch, etc. to connect startup s with corporations.   d) China has formed a "national team" with large private players including Baidu and Tencent to  undertake fundamental and applied research across differen t AI topics, e.g., Baidu is working  with the Chinese government to develop brain -inspired intelligent technology   Meanwhile, recent developments in the digital ecosystem have triggered a discussion on implications for  regulations on data protection and priv acy. EU has released a comprehensive legal framework for data  protection called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This framework details the rights of  individuals (consent, data portability, etc.), obligations of businesses (define and share how t hey will use  personal data, norms for data processing, data protection impact assessment, etc.) and plan of action in  case of a data breach (data breach notifications, compensation to individuals, penalties, etc.) .

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     109    rapidly across geographies an d sectors, governments across the world are actively working on  developing data pri vacy and security regulations.   Furthermore, governments are playing an active role in developing AI ecosystems to capitali se on the  social, economic benefits and establish leadership in the field of AI.   a) Social benefits : Governments are focusing on sectors ranging from education to healthcare,  agriculture to transport mobility with a view to significantly improve quality of life of its citi zens.  b) Economic benefits : Governments have defined substantial economic aspirations through  development and implementation of AI. While China aims to grow AI’s contribution to GDP to 26  percent and the U.K. by 10 percent by 2030, Japan has estimated the economic impact of AI  applic ation at JPY 1.1 trillion by 2045.   c) Leadership in AI : Given the rapid pace at which AI technology is evolving, governments are  setting themselves up for success with support from the private sector and academia. However,  the models of engagement vary depend ing on starting points, challenges and appetite for public  funding and regulation.   If some countries decide to wait for a few years to establish an AI strategy and put in place the foundations  for developing the AI ecosystem, it seems unlikely that they w ould be able to attain and match up to the  current momentum in the rapidly changing socio -economic environment. Therefore, the need of the hour  is to develop a policy framework that will help set up a vibrant AI ecosystem in India.   The following table hig hlights funding commitments made by governments across the world to promote  AI research and application:   Country  Area  Funding   Belgium   AI research in  academia   Two funding agencies – FWO (Flanders) and FNRS  (Wallonia) .   FNRS spent approximately EUR 1.8 million per year in  the period 2011 -2017 and FWO appro ximately EUR 6.7  million per year.    Between 2011 and 2017 around 67 out of 241 AI -related  applications (representing 2.3% of all applications)  submitted to FNRS were funded, and 175 out of the 832  AI-related applications sent to FWO were also accepted.   China   AI startups   In China, governments play a deliberate and explicit role  in fundi ng scientific research (giving USD800,000 to  USD 1 million in subsidies to AI companies) .  Denmark   AI startups   The Innovatio n Fund Denmark has provided EUR 20  million as funding for big data in 2017 .  Germany   AI basic research    Applied AI  research   With an  annual budget of more than EUR 3 billion, the  German Research Foundation (DFG) is the main source  of funding for basic  research in AI in Germany .   In the past thirty years (1988 -2018), applied AI has been  funded continuously by the Federal Ministry of  Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung  und Forsch ung - BMBF), for a total of EUR 215 million.    Current  annual  investment in AI is EUR 40-50 million.  Between 1988 and 2017, DF KI received EUR200 million  from BMBF . There is additional funding allocated to  universities and other research centres by the  government.  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     110     BMBF and the Federal Ministry of the Economy and  Energ y (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie -  BMWi) are currently funding a selection of Industry 4.0  projects such as Mixed Reality Pro duction 4.0, for a total  of EUR 550 million since 2013.    The program Smart Services World II aims to address  areas whe re digitalisation could have an impact for the  economy. It has  funding of EUR 50 million from BMWi  (2017 -2021).   Ireland   AI startups   The Irish government spends, through the Irish  Economic Development Agency (IDA), Enterprise  Ireland, and Scien ce Foundation  Ireland, over EUR 700  million on R&D annually. Enterprise Ireland funds Irish  companies and is the largest VC fund in Europe.   Israel   AI ecosystem –  partnerships   The Israeli government has several grant funding  schemes for promoting collaboration and knowledge  transfer between academia and industry, such as  Magnet and Magneton .   The Israeli Science Foundation has a rich history of  funding AI projects in academia that provide researchers  with a high degree of freedom in their research  compared to other c ountries.   Netherlands   AI research –  academia   The main funding body for academia in the Netherlands  is the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research  (NWO). Since 2002, NWO has funded 119 research  projects containing the term ‘artificial intelligence’ and  142 research projects containing the term ‘machine  learning’. In 2015, a programme on ‘Natural Artificial  Intelligence’ was launched, which has funded five  projects.   Spain   AI in industry   Since 2016, EUR 170 million has been invested in the  Industry 4.0 project Industria Conectada 4.0 under the  National R&D and Innovation Plan.

EUR38.9  million)  in the past 6 years.     Source : Accenture
Appendix I II: Data Ecosystem    A key enabler   The true value of AI will not be found in, say, an algorithm or a neural network itself.   Today, the leading algorithms are available as software packages either commercially or open source.  Storage infrastructure and huge computing resources has become commoditi sed and easily available  from various vendors in the market. The challenge still remains with data – access to high quality , reliable  data along with appro priate mark -ups still remains a challenge.   Understanding key issues related to data thus become s crucial while evolving the national AI strategy.   Access to vast quantities of data  is vital for AI to be effective. Large platform s and technology  companies w ho create monolith s of high volumes of d ata have a distinct advantage compared to  smaller  companies and startup s, thus  leading to a very skewed market.   Convergence of data  is another challenge, with much data being either “dark” (unstructured, not readily   usable) or disparate (hard to combine). Organisations need to be able to converge and make sense of  data from sources such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and social networks. The greater the data  density and variety, the greater are the chances  of finding “unknown unknowns” – relationships that were  not known to exist or were not looked for at all.   Data a nnotation  is crucial, given the requirement of tagged or annotated data required for machine  learning or AI. In most cases,  data need s to be annotate d manually or in semi -automated ways for the  purpose of machine learning, even though sometime s annotated data can be generated automatically  from the source. Technological advancements in data annotation systems are not at a level where manual  annotation can be replaced.   Box 21 : ImageNet   The ImageNet database has led to huge advancement in the field of image recognition. The ImageNet  database was presented for the first time as a poster at the 2009 Conference on Computer Vision and  Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in Florida by researchers from the Computer Science department at  Princeton University. The ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object  recognition software research. Over 14 millio n URLs of images have been hand annotated by ImageNet  to indicate what objec ts are pictured; in at least 1  million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided.  ImageNet contains over 20,000  ambiguous categories; a typical category, such as "balloon" or  "strawberry", contains several hu ndred images. The database of annot ations of third -party image URL s  is freely available directly from ImageNet; however, the actual images are not owned by ImageNet.   The 2010s saw dramatic progress in image processing. In 2011, a good ILSVRC classification  error rate  was 25%. In 2012, a deep convolutional neural net achieved 16%; in the next couple of years, err or rates  fell to a few percent. With  the 2012 breakthrough "combined pieces that were all there before", the  dramatic quantitative improvement marke d the start of an industry wide AI boom. By 2015, researchers  reported that software exceeded human ability at the narrow ILSVRC tasks. However, as one of the  challenge's organisers, Olga Russakovsky, pointed out in 2015, the programs only have to identify  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     112    images as belonging to one of a thousand categories; humans can recogni se a larger number of  categories, and also (unlike the programs) can judge the context of an image.   Overcoming issues related to data a ccess   a) Government data sharing : Government of India has large amounts of data lying in silos across  ministries. The g overnment can launch a mission of making all these data available for public  good after undertaking proper privacy checks. For example – climate data, non -strategic remo te  sensing data, regional language speech (from All India Radio), soil health data etc.   b) Corporate data s haring : Corporates based in India may be mandated to share their data for social  good. For example, sharing transportation pattern of individuals  / mass transits, collected by  service providers and aggregators, can help the city planners help in planning routes, predicting  and managing traffic.   c) Consent based data sharing: Lot of the data about individuals are personal in nature and hence  cannot be shared  by third party who have the  access to these data – like financial institutions or  hospitals. Upon proper and informed consent from the citizen s, these anonymised data may be  shared for the purpose of artificial intelligence and data analytics.   d) Digiti sed and crowdsourced collection of data by government : Huge amounts of money and time  is spend every few years to carry out the household consumption survey. A mechanism, as  adopted by online social networks, to incentivise individuals to share details of their  consumption  pattern  via an app can greatly reduce the cost of  manual surveys and lend itself to big data  analysis and AI applicability.   Often AI based transformation follows as a next step to digital transformation – in that case, the data for  the purpos e of learning exists with the organi sation. For example, a financial institution would have  access to large amounts of historic customer records to develop the AI system for predictive loan defaults.   People or organi sations outside the data ecosystem migh t have limited access to this data. For example,  a new company entering in the space of rural financing would need access to huge amounts of customer  data along with information on the default rates to develop the risk based lending model. To bridge this  access gap, some of these datasets are made available by the research communities as shown in the  tables below.

  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     114      Appendix I V: What Do the Markets Say?    Approaches to evaluating focus sector areas     One way of evaluating which sectors to focus on is to follow the money i.e. which sectors have seen the  most amount of VC funding in AI space. Venture Capital funding, in a sense, is a long -term view on a  technology / solution, given that the median time to exit for most VC investments is more than 8 years.   The AI ecosystem is essentially based on 5 pillars:   a) policy makers,   b) large companies,   c) startups,   d) universities and   e) multi -stakeholder partnerships.   Taking into account this  perspective as well, sectors that are most pursued by VCs could be a good proxy  for sectors to be focused on, for well -funded startups are capable of p ushing the technology frontiers and  bringing ambitious solutions to fruition.   AI remains the most active industry vertical in VC funding landscape, with an aggregate  total investment  of more than USD 31 billion  globally across more than 3,600 disclosed dea ls in past 5 years43. Healthcare  has been the hottest area o f AI startup investments, with USD 2.5 billion  in VC investments in last 5 years,  much of which has been fueled by medical imaging and diagnostics companies. Other active healthcare  sub-segments inc lude clinical trials & drug discovery and insights and risk analytics. The healthcare AI  space has also been dominated by strong public partnerships in diagnostics: nVIDIA and GE, Google  Deep Mind and NHS, AliHealth and AstraZeneca.   Another way to evaluat e this could be to see where the large global tech companies (Google,  Apple,  Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, popularly termed GAFAM , as well as Alibaba and  its peers Baidu,  Tencent and Xiaomi, popularly termed BATX  in China) are most invested in. Among GAF AM, looking at  the mentions of “Machine Learning” in respective earning transcripts since 2013, Google emerges as the  company that has been highlighting its progress in AI  / ML more than others.   Tracking Google’s AI  / ML initiatives, it appears that the M ountain View based company is heavily  invested in Healthcare. Indeed, GV, formerly Google Ventures, the venture capital investment arm of  Alphabet Inc., has tripled its investments in Healthcare deals in 2017 compared to 2013. Google’s  approach to using AI  to tackle diseases and lifestyle management is based on three pillar approach :   a) Data generation: digiti sation and consolidation of data through wearables and medical imaging  etc.                                                         43 CB Insights: “Artificial Intelligence Trends To Watch In 2018” and “Up And Up: Healthcare AI Startups See Record Deals”  
  Discussion Paper   National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence     115    b) Disease detection   c) Disease / lifestyle management   Google is currently heavily  focused on eye diseases (diabetic retinopathy), diabetes (detection and  management), heart disease (including hearth condition monitoring), Parkinson’s disease and multiple  sclerosis. Google’s AI algorithm for diabetic retinopathy, trained on 128,000 imag es, was on -par w ith a  panel of ophthalmologists . Other areas that Google may be exploring include Chronic Lower Respiratory  Disease, several types of cancer, mental and behavioral health and aging.   Google is also invested in powering the healthcare data in frastructure, as evident in its USD625 million  acquisition of Apigee, which is building healthcare APIs catering to the latest health records  interoperability protocols. Similarly, Deep Mind is building a data infrastructure to enabling building of  apps th at can analy se different data elements. Furthermore, Google is also building health data streams  that third parties could integrate in their research. Another one of Google’s interesting foray in healthcare  AI is developing tools for doctors that are desig ned to augment their expertise.
