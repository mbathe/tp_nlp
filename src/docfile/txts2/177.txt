“It’s also important to recognize that the risks posed by GenAI are only one part of a broader Responsible AI program. Responsible AI is an approach that aligns the output of AI with an organization’s values by proactively building systems that are reliable, accountable, fair, and transparent. Together, these comprise the RAFT framework for Responsible AI.”
