To achieve its long -term objective of the effective  implementation of AI in the healthcare s ector  the Commission plans to work on a  common  legislation and policy framework to yield the benefits that AI can bring.   Based on evidence gathered in this study, while most EU MS that have developed AI  strategies  identify healthcare as a priority sector , there are no  policies  within  those  strategies targeting healthcare in particular. At the same time, EU MS have made  progress in proposing regulatory frameworks around the management of health data  which is a foundational element for the further development of AI technologies in the  healthcare sector. In terms of adoption, while healthcare organisations in the EU are open  to adopting AI applications, at present, adoption is still limited to specific departments,  teams and application areas. The lack of trust in AI -driven decision support is hindering  the wider adoption, while issues around integrating new techno logies into current practice  are also prominent challenges identified by relevant stakeholders in EU MS. The scientific  output of EU MS in the area of AI in healthcare is largely attributed to the larger EU MS  which are also the most active in collaboratin g between each other and with smaller MS.   Additionally, a need is identified for further financial support to support  the development  of AI technologies which are translated into clinical practice, including support targeting  the acquisition of Intellectu al Property (IP) rights for the developed technologies.    To promote the development and adoption of AI technologies in the healthcare sector,  the Commission may address challenges related to polic y supporting the further  development and adoption of AI in healthcare, increase investment, enable the access ,  use and exchange  of healthcare data, and develop initiatives to upskill healthcare  professionals and to educate AI Developers on current clinical practices.  Addressing  culture issues around trust in the use of AI in the healthcare sector and creat ing or  updating  policy support ing the translation of research into clinical practice  were also  important insights extracted from this study.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      10     1. Introduction   Recognising the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in transforming health and care in  the EU Member States (MS) , the European Commission  (EC) has been taking steps, in  the last few years,  towards advancing the development and uptake of AI technologies to  help EU citizens better monitor their health, receive better diagnoses and more  personalized treatments, as well as  live a healthier and more independent life. As a step  towards achieving this goal, the European Commission adopted a plan  to digitally  transform the health and care system into a Digital Single Market7 and to put EU citizens  at the centre of the healthcare system.   One of th is Comm unication's key priorities was to encourage the pooling of data for  research and personalised medicine. Following this line of thought, the European  Commission presented the Communication on Artificial Intelligence8 on May 2018 , and  the Communication on a Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence9 in December 2018 .  The aim of these were  to build a strategy on AI at European level, launching several  initiatives to support AI adoption in the healthcare  sector , as well as  to mobilise all players  to increase public and private investments to at least EUR 20 billion annually over the  next decade. The Commission doubled its investments in AI in Horizon 2020 , and plans  to invest EUR 1 billion annually from Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe  Programme10, in supp ort of common data spaces in health, transport and manufacturing,  as well as  large experimentation facilities , such as smart hospitals and infrastructures for  automated vehicles via a  strategic research agenda.    While AI has  evidently become an area of st rategic importance and a key driver of  economic development, the current situation in the EU indicates  that healthcare  organisations are slow in implementing AI technologies in healthcare and that the level  of adoption is low overall and differs in each co untry. The long -term goal of the  Commission is the effective implementation of AI in the healthcare s ector  which is based  around a common legislation and policy framework to yield the benefits that AI can bring.   However, an objective like this cannot be f ully completed without having to overcome a  few challenges. For instance , an important challenge is what scientific research  investments must be done and what government -funded mechanisms which need to be  put into place for the correct translation of this research into clinical practice. Additionally,  the development and adoption of AI in healthcare relies heavily on access to high quality  clinical data, therefore, the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs)  and their interoperability within  EU Member States  is an important step to support   progress on the AI front. Challenges such as safety of devices and applications, medical   ethics, lack of information from the side of the patient and job security also need to be  overcome. These challenges,  and many more, need to be recognised and understood.  Moreover, the socioeconomic, legal and ethical impacts of AI adoption must be carefully                                                    7 Communication of the Commission t o the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on  the Mid -Term Review on the implementation of the Digital Single Market Strategy “A Connected Digital Single Market for All”, COM(2017 ) 228.   8 Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the C ommittee of the Regions,  “Artificial Intelligence for Europe”, COM(2018) 237.    9 Communication of the Commission to the Euro pean Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions,  “Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence”, COM(2018) 795.   10 “Digital Europe Programme: Summary Report on the targeted consultation on the future  of investment in Europe’s digital economy”, December 2019, accessible at   https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/digital -europe -programme -summary -report -targeted -consultation -future -investment -europes -digital 
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      11   addressed, which requires a clear understanding of the current state of AI development,  adoption, challenges, as w ell as stakeholders’ views around it.   Towards this, the E C, via DG CONNECT,  has commissioned this study,  with the   overarching objective to provide the European  Commission  with a comprehensive  overview of the current situation in the EU with regards to the development, adoption and  use of AI technologies and applications in the healthcare sector  in the EU Member States .    To build on existing knowledge as well as  to contrib ute to the develop ment of  a policy  framework that  will enable the further development and adoption of AI in the EU MS, this  study aim s to provid e an overview and analysis of:    Relevant legislation and policy frameworks concerning the development, adoption  and use of AI technologies and applications in the healthcare sector in the EU   MS.   The scientific output of EU MS and the state of collaboration between MS in the  area of AI in healthcare.     The nature and types of AI technologies and applications developed  and deployed  in healthcare facilities in the EU M S.    Social media and news awareness of each EU MS in the area of AI in healthcare.    Stakeholders’ views with regard s to the development, adoption and use of AI  technologies and applications in the healthcare  sector in the EU MS.    The challengers and barriers hindering the more widespread development and  adoption of AI technologies and applications in the healthcare sector in the EU  MS.    To retrieve information from credible online databases regarding the R&D  output of EU  MS in terms of scientific papers and patents, and to identify the start -ups in the EU  working in the area of AI in healthcare we developed computer scripts and built queries  based on combinations of keywords related to AI and healthcare.  Sim ilar tools were also  developed and employed in order to collect social awareness indices from social media  posts and news articles. In addition, an online survey was developed and distributed to  relevant stakeholders in the EU MS, to collect information fo r measuring progress on the  development, adoption and use AI technologies and applications in the healthcare sector  and to obtain stakeholders’ opinions regarding the challenges they are facing.   The  content of the current report was produced through a co mbination of the data collected  via the analytical tools, the survey, as well as information extracted through desk research  from a wide range of credible information sources.              
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      12     2. Methodological Overview   A high -level description of the  methodological a pproach is briefly elaborated below, while   a detailed description of the methodology can be found in Annex I.   Our methodology was driven by the need to understand the development, adoption and  use of AI technologies and applications in the healthcare sect or in the EU . Therefore,  our  first task w as to carry -out a thorough literature review based on several sources , in order  to acquire a more solid understanding of the current situation.   Upon completion of the literature review and  based on the issues and commonalities  identified, we selected Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) providing measures of the R&D  output of each EU MS in terms of scientific publications, multilateral and bilateral  collaboration scores within the EU, patents granted in the area of AI in healthcare, start ups working in the area of AI in healthcare, as well as social awareness issues around  the topic of AI in healthcare.  We then proceeded to develop computer scripts and  analysis tools in order to obtain reliab le information  from credible online databases to  obtain measures of the selected KPIs.   In addition, we develop ed a survey tool to collect data for measuring progress on the  development, adoption and use of AI technologies .  We divided the sampling populat ion  into three sectors: Developers of AI technologies , Users of AI technologies , and Public  Authorities . To achieve the objective of this study, appropriate questions were selected  for each group.  The survey was then administered to relevant stakeholders f rom the three  target groups in the 27 EU Member States.   The content of this  study report is, thus, the combined summarisation of the results of  analysis based on insights from the literature review , information  retrieval from online  sources, a nd the results from the survey carried -out, to give an overall picture of the state  of development and adoption of AI in the healthcare sector in the EU, and to also identify  and discuss common barriers and challenges around the deployment of such solutions .  The process of information -gathering and flow for compiling the final report is shown in  Figure  1.  The sources of information  we used for the literature review were mainly focus ed  around the categories  of: Scientific Papers, EU and national publications, EU and national  surveys and market and technology reports. Each of these categories offered a different  type of information ; for example , scientific papers provided information in terms of  theoretical considerations  and areas of application,  whereas EU and  national publications  provided insights regarding past achievements, current activities and policies. Moreover,  inputs regarding the methodological framework for the survey were given by review ing  EU and national surveys , while an indication of EU technol ogy trends  and digital  breakthroughs was given from the assessment of numerous market and technology  watch reports. During our literature search, we ensured that only high standard papers,  reports and publications were taken into consideration for the subs equent analysis.   The limitations of this study  are mainly related to its timeframe, short duration and  disruptions caused by the COVID -19 pandemic.    The timing  of the survey administration  (5 July – 15 December 2020) amidst  the  COVID -19 pandemic meant that  a large number of recipients  were not available  to respond to  the survey. While the study’s sample is not statistically  representative due to the impossibility of collecting a reasonable amount  of 
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      13   responses  from all Member States , an analysis of responses  has been used to  identify trends, draw preliminary insights and provide the basis for further  exploration11.12    The survey questionnaire was only made available in English , which  may have  impacted the understanding of the questionnaire , and as a result  limited the  number of responses received.    Misconceptions and misinterpretations on what technologies are classified as “AI”  could not be avoided. As observed in  this study, there appears to be a general  lack of understanding about what Artificial Intelligence means in the context of  healthcare .       a. National -level strategies and initiatives around AI in healthcare   Despite  the existence of an EU -level coordinated plan around AI, individual and national  strengths will need to be joined and materialized at a European level in order to fully  exploit the benefits of AI at a European level. In order to gain momentum at a European  level and withstand the fierce international competition, the EU needs to overcome the  fragmentation of the union and embrace collaboration.   Across the European Union, individual Member State s (MS)  have been  working towards  the development of their national  AI strategies as they recognize the potential benefits  these can bring to their countries , once developed and implemented.  As of January 2021,  20 EU Member States have officially published  reports as independent pieces of work  that include various policy recommendations and planned activities to enhance the use  of AI at a national level. While these studies are in some cases published using the term  National AI Strategy , several  EU countries have instead commission ed studies which will                                                    11 To alleviate this limitation, we enhanced the collected information via the development of analytical data intelligence tools  to extract information from online database  which made it possible to provide reliable and statistically valid information to res pond to the study’s objectives.   12 The low levels of adoption in some Member States (MS), may have deterred some survey recipients from the “AI Users” and “Public A uthorities” groups in participating  in the survey.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      14   form the foundation for the future development of such a  strategy . Some examples  include:     Spain’s Research, Development and Innovation ( RDI) Strategy on AI13, which  serves as the foundation for the dev elopment of its AI strategy, and which aims,  among other things, to provide guidelines for the coordination and alignment of  national investments and policies as well as  help improve synergies . Moreover, it  will allow public and private investments to be d irected at the incentivization of the  use of new technologies in society and economy.    The Austrian Council on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ’s white paper on  “Shaping the Future of Austria in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence”14 which paves  the way  towards the development of the country’s  AI strategy.   Seven EU MS have not published any national -level AI strategy or mission reports. While  some of these countries were expected to publish their strategies within 2020, the COVID 19 pandemic has had a s ignificant impact on progress  in various aspects , with one being  the delay in finali sing AI strategies.   While National AI strategies are the key documents showing the commitment of EU MS   in adopting A I, MS have also taken other  steps to engage with AI through other initiatives.    Such initiatives include work around p olicy intelligence (e.g. evaluations, benchmarking  and f orecasts), f ormal consultation s of stakeholders or experts , the formation of  regulatory oversight and ethical advice bodies , public awareness campaigns and other  outreach activities , the availability of p roject grants for public research , grants for  business R&D and innovation , procurement program s for R&D and innovation ,                                                    13 Ministry of Science, Innovation and Univ ersities, 2019, Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      16   b. Policies and initiatives around AI applications in healthcare     AI-focused strategies and policy instruments include initiatives aiming to build the EU’s  adoption of AI across industries. With regards to healt hcare, most Member States  have  identified healthcare as one of the key sectors  that needs to be prioritized  in the  context of AI.    National AI strategies incorporate the field of healthcare in various ways. In these key  documents there is mention of healthcare in the topics of data, ethics,  research and  innovation  as well as public services .   The development of AI applications is ofte n dependent on the availability of data as well  as the quality of data. In the healthcare sector the need for data is exemplified , since  good  data can become the foundation for AI solutions on areas such as diagnos tics and  treatments. Despite the opening -up of databases, as suggested by various AI strategies,  it should be noted that EU Member States  are not intending to violate legislation around  the protection of personal data. Making the use of AI ethical and  transparent is of great  relevance to  the healt hcare sector, with the notion of trust emerging as a significant   component of this. AI -powered methods and processes used within the sector should be  trusted by society.   Pilot and signature projects are expected to be launched by Member States ’ government s  to enhance the use of AI in the public secto r, including the healthcare  sector. There are  increasing pressures on healthcare systems arising from a growing and ageing  population which call for public reforms. The opportunity to use AI to alleviate the pr essure  is immense.  The creation of cent res of excellence for R&D and national AI labs often  appear in the recommendations of the AI strategies along with the reinforcement of  available funding for R&D. In the highly regulated environment of healthcare, re gulatory  expertise may be provided in order to support and enable AI -powered applications to  make it into real -life markets. Fostering R&D is expected to result in more AI -induced  innovations and make nations more competitive. Additionally, m ost strategies  stress the  importance of AI being integrated to the provision of healthcare services in the future ,  hence, these documents are providing steps toward s achieving this goal. The integration  of AI will help achieve the 4 Ps of healthcare ; personali sed, preve ntive, predictive and  participatory.   Steps towards the EU’s vision of a more collaborative and unified Union that  fully  leverage s the opportunities AI presents in tackling the big issues facing healthcare have  also been undertaken and launched under European Commission umbrella projects,  such as Horizon 2020 and include the ‘AI-on-demand platform ’ (AI4EU16) and the network  of European AI research excellence centres. The AI4EU platform, will facilitate the  creation of a European AI ecosystem and will be  an access point to all resources required  to engage with AI. The network will focus on the mobilization of AI scientists to produce  high-quality research and will promote cooperation between academics and industry.    c. Initiatives and proposed activities fro m National AI -strategies  and policy instruments   While not directly linked to healthcare within the documents themselves, many of the  initiatives and proposed activities within these strategic documents have horizontal  applications and are related to the he althcare sector, as well. These fall within the  following umbrellas :  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      17    Capability -Building and Upskilling    Transition from Research to Application    Data and Infrastructure   Next, we present our findings in terms of policies and initiatives included in Nationa l AI  Strategies  which are directly relevant to the healthcare  sector .   Capability Building and Upskilling   Recommendations  under this pillar focus on promoting knowledge and capability around  AI technologies , through education and up -skilling initiatives via physical and online  platforms. In addition, capability building concerns the creation of cross -disciplinary and  cross -border collaborations to promote knowledge exchange and enhanced innovation  activities.     Education - Policy reforms and initiatives for formal training and education, such  as the creation of the ‘Teach -and-learn AI’ platform to develop a solid skill base in  AI targeting specific user groups – as stated in the Germany AI strategy – or the  creation of additional university positions focusing  in the field of AI to ensure that  AI has a strong foothold within the higher education system. Other examples  include the National Data Science Trainee program me in the Netherlands AI  strategy .     Up-skilling - such as the creation of the National Skills St rategies to promote  advanced vocational training in digital and AI -related aspects among others ,  including online training courses on AI for civil servants    The formation of a cross -border networks, such as the Franco -German R&D  network (“virtual cent re”) offering bilateral funding and training program s with  bilateral AI clusters in specific industries, including healthcare.     Transition from Research to Application   Policies under this pillar focus on AI research, program mes to foster entrepreneurship  and to promote growth of startups working on AI applications.  It also covers funding  initiatives and the provision of infrastructure to encourage innovation and to facilitate the  process of launching AI applications on the mark et, including in the healthcare sector.   National AI strategies highlight a wide range of policy initiatives to foster networks and  collaborations across the business community, academia and public research cent res for  the purpose of encouraging the develo pment of multidisciplinary cutting -edge research  and innovation projects.  Initiatives extending from the formation of Public Private  Partnerships (PPPs) and cross -border partnerships and collaborations on AI research  aim to fully exploit synergies and div ersities across institutional and cross -border players  by promoting knowledge dissemination and transfers.  In addition, under this pillar, many  countries have initiated projects and policies around the dissemination of knowledge  around AI to the general pu blic, as a way of build ing trust and promot ing adoption.   Some specific initiatives around this pillar include :                                                     16 European Commission via CORD IS: A European AI on demand platform and Ecosystem, documents and reports accessible at  https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/825619/results

Within these strategies, AI is being recognised as an essential  ingredient in this process. Examples include Germany’s ‘Digital Healthcare Act’18 and  Hungary’s ‘Hungarian National eHealth Platform (EESZT) ’19. Ireland has published an  ‘eHealth Strategy for I reland’20 and has outlined its 10 -year healthcare vision which  incorporates digital health , while  Sweden has published a strategy to implement its ‘Vision  for eHealth 2025’21. France has also adopted the ‘Health Act’ following  the ‘My Health  2022’22 report , and Estonia  has developed the ‘ Estonian eHealth Strategic Development  Plan 2020 ’23, including a strategic plan for 2020 and a vision for 2025 .  Although the integration of AI in healthcare is still in its early stages, most of these  documents and actions depi ct the momentum present in the EU regarding Electronic  Health Records (E HRs), recogni sed widely as a n important steps towards  the more  widespread  development and adoption of AI applications in the healthcare sector .   France is one of the few Member States  that explicitly includes AI in its healthcare -related  documents and actions. The country’s e -health readiness is also dependent on AI , and  the sharing of Big Data to foster AI innovation is anticipated to give France a competitive  advantage and encourage health startups to develop AI -powered solutions24.                                                       18Driving the digital transfomation of Germany’s healthcare system for the good of patients.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      20     e. Refining the regulatory framework   A review of the AI-promoting  initiatives  from EU Member States  reveals a momentum,  however there are no initiatives within these strategies targeting the healthcare sector in  particular.   To support the successful development and deployment of AI technologies in  the heal thcare sector, a targeted, well-developed and effective regulatory framework  is  required . Our survey of Public Responses from authorities across the EU (based on  responses from 18 Member States) reveal the absence of legislation around AI in  healthcare in 75% of respondents (see Figure 3). In contrast, 75% of respondents  indicated that legislation around the storage and sharing of healthcare data and the  protocols around it were already in place (see Figure 4). An absence of policies and  legislation  directl y relevant to applications of AI in the healthcare sector, as well as  limited  strategic direction at a national level were also listed as  obstacle s to the widespread  adoption of AI in healthcare  by Public Authority respondents. Specific examples of  challen ges mentioned by survey respondents which may be mitigated by the presence of  a refined regulatory framework and national -level strategic initiatives include:   “The lack strategic direction around the translation of R&D into wide -scale deployment”   “Lack of precise legislation around AI”   “Lack of financing for experimentation on AI in hospitals”   “The need for EHR implementation before”   “The need to find smart technical solutions while not compromising personal data  protections”   “Lack of strategic initiatives and investments”  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      21   “Lack of certificati on mechanisms for AI”   “The need for benchmarking of AI solutions against existing clinical solutions”   “Long processes to acquire certification”   “The need for a legal framework that does not hinder innovation”   “Regulations for data sharing specifically f or healthcare research”    “Lack of legal solutions supporting the use of AI in health facilities. ”    “Lack of relevant knowledge and competence among patients and health professionals. ”  “Resistance to change ”.  In addition, several respondents highlighted the uncertainty around the effect of  introducing stringent regulations in the area of AI, to innovation in this area.    Similarly, as shown in Figure 5, the responses from survey respondents from the AI  Develope rs group identify similar issues and regulatory gaps, recognising a need for  stringent policies around AI testing and certification, policies supporting research and  innovation and policies encouraging the deployment of AI technologies in healthcare. The  need for strict regulations around d ata protection rules regarding the use and exchange  of health data for the purpose of AI analysis, was also highlighted by survey respondents.   While the existence of regulation around health data sharing is a positive first step, it is  clear that there is indeed a regulatory vacuum hindering the development and adoption  of AI in the healthcare sector recognised equally by Public Authorities and A I Developers;   an innovation -friendly regulatory framework is important and should tackle among other  issues the integration of AI technologies into healthcare practice, issues around Figure 4: Responses from Public Authorities to the question “Is there national legislation in place  regarding the storage and sharing of healthcare data and the protocols around it?”   
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      22   information management, data ownership, free flow of data, certification  and  standardization. Measures to promote research and innovation and the translation of  research into clinical practice are also important, as well as initiatives promoting upskilling  and the promotion of trust on AI in the healthcare.   Furthermore, based on survey respons es, issues around AI ethics,  transparency  and  interpretability do not appear high in the agenda of stakeholders, who appear to be  prioritising more basic practical hurdles that need to be overcome.   Measures to promote research and innovation and the transl ation of research into clinical  practice are also important, as well as initiatives promoting upskilling and the promotion  of trust on AI in the healthcare  sector were also issues highlighted by survey respondents  and should be addressed from a regulatory aspect . Some policy recommendations and  initiatives emerging as important, include:      Policies around the development of competition and copyright law .   Policies around the introduction of certifications for the use of AI in healthcare.    Legislations provi ding reskilling opportunities and support to employees whose  job is at risk due to AI technologies .     Data protection rules regarding the use and exchange of health data, which at the  same time  safeguard s the control on personal data, compliant with EU law .   Amendments in current legislations concerning the use of non -personal data as  well as copyright .   Accelerating the implementation of cyber security directives locally as required by  the EU Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS) requires  Member States  to adopt a national cyber -security strategy.    Ethical requirements to ensure tr ansparency, verifiability and predictability of AI  systems, especially for critical sectors, such as healthcare.    Funding for the development of data standards and formats to encourage EU wide collaborations . Figure 5: Respon ses from AI Developers to the question “Which of the following areas of  legislation/policy with regards to the development and usage of AI -enabled healthcare  tools would you like to see in place?” (multiple selection).   
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      23    Funding for experts, particularly from SMEs and  startu ps in order to support their  participation in international standardization processes .   Funding to SMEs for obtaining IP on their innovative products around AI in  healthcare.    Improving access to innovation funding and venture capital through differe nt  schemes focusing mainly on SMEs targeting individual and collective R&D  projects .   It is worth noting that many of these issues emerging as important from a policy  perspective in the context of AI in healthcare are issues which have been identified as  important in the wider context of digital transformation in the  healthcare  sector . The  results of the public consultation on transformation of Health and Care in the Digital Single  Market25 identified most of the above issues as barriers, from a policy and l egislation  perspective, for the wider adoption of digital healthcare, referring in particular to the need  for addressing risks of privacy breaches, cybersecurity risks, and the lack of  infrastructure, as well as policies to promote the standardization of E HRs, development  of harmonised standards for data -quality and reliability, introduction of health -related  cybersecurity standards, and support for cross -border interoperability through open  exchange formats. To address the low level of adoption of digital health solutions in health  care, the same report concluded that there is a need for sustained EU investment in  research and innovation, the transfer of knowledge and practices between Member  States and regions, as well as common approaches for feedback mec hanisms about  quality of treatment. The issues that appear to be more directly related to AI in particular,  are those of ethics and transparency and the need for AI -specific certifications.     f. Investments in the area of AI in healthcare   Showcasing its commitment to the promotion of AI for a better Europe, the EU also  proposed an investment of at least EUR 7 billion in AI for the period of 2021 -2027. This  strengthening will come through the Horizon Europe and Digital Europe program mes.  More specifically for healthcare, f ollowing the COVID -19 pandemic, the ‘EU4Health’26  program me, discussed earlier,  aims  to stimulate the digitali sation and strengthening of  health systems and to boost innovation in the field of medicine and pharmaceuticals. B oth  targets will enhance the outlook of the EU with regard s to AI and healthcare.   As indicated by survey responses from public authorities, figures around AI investments  particularly targeting applications in healthcare are not available. Respondents from only  two MS provided figures for planned funding around the development of AI in healthcare.   This may be attested to the following:    Most public research funding program mes are  either focusing on   o Applications of AI  without specifying a particular sector  or   o Applications of ICT in healthcare   As a result, the funding awarded at the intersection of these two areas (AI applications in  healthcare) is not precisely known.                                                     25 European Commissio n via DG CONNECT and DG Health, 2018, Consultation:Transformation Health and Care in the Digital Single Market, Synopsis Repo rt.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      24    There is ambiguity in defining health technology applications as AI -based  or not.  Indee d, it was evident from some of the survey responses that , often, healthcare  applications utili sing automation or rule -based decision support, or applications  around medical robotics are often wrongly considered AI applications , even  though they are not usi ng AI methodologies.    There were cases of public authorities that responded that they could not provide  numbers of public investments in the area of AI in healthcare because the  distribution of funds was not done at a national level but  instead  at a federal  or  regional level.   Looking at the survey responses from AI Developers working on healthcare applications,  most respondents received funding for the development of AI technologies in healthcare  via public funding initiatives, either from nati onal (29%) or European Commission (28%)  funding schemes. Only 15% of AI developers have used private funding and of those,  only 6% have received both public and private funding,  indicating that despite an increase  in private investment to support the star tup ecosystem across Europe, research and  innovation in the area of AI in Healthcare is still  heavily reliant on public funding .    Based on survey responses, most AI developers have received funding in excess of EUR  500K (29%), followed by EUR 100-500K (2 1%), and less than EUR 100K (14%).  Most  privately  funded start -ups have received less than EUR 100K in private funding , while, as  expected, AI developers that have received funding from multiple sources have received  a higher total amount of funding.   Ad ditionally, looking at the responses of AI Developers  regarding the challenges identified in moving their products to the market , 56% of  the AI Developer  respondents identified the lack of financial resources  as a barrier to  the adoption of AI technologies  in healthcare . Furthermore, seeing as 26% of AI  Developers indicated receiving funding from multiple sources (public national, public  European or private), the Commission may need to dive further into the per -project  budgets allocated, to ensure that inno vative companies can obtain sufficient funds for  translating their research into applications and for taking them to industry without having  to dedicate a large amount of time and resources in multiple, and often cumbersome,  funding application processes. This point was further highlighted by Public Authorities in  responses to an open -ended question regarding the most important barriers to AI  adoption in healthcare, e.g., “Lack of funding (especially from private resources)”,  “Insufficient Funding” and “ Resource capacity to sustain innovative solutions and  technologies and available funding ”.   
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      25   More so in the case of SMEs, stronger financial support and dedicated funding schemes  targeting AI in healthcare are evidently necessary to support organisations in translating  their innovative products into the market. Limited funding schemes provide only short term support to innovative companies , and do not support the translation  of products  outside the lab, instead they  may be tying -in researchers into dead -end cycles of R&D  which does not make it to the market and does not sustain innovation in the longer -term  development.   It should be noted that responses from the AI Developers group included only start-ups  which are eligible for na tional and EU funding under national and European SME instrument funding schemes. As evidenced by our study around patent applications  in the  area of AI in healthcare  in the EU , in the last three years, approximately 80% of patents  in the area of AI in hea lthcare have been granted to just two large healthcare technology  corporations ( Siemens Healthcare GMBH in Germany and Koninklijke Philips in the  Netherlands). This means that most innovation around AI in healthcare  in the EU   which makes it to the market s tems from large private organi sations and  consequently from  private funding. It is evident that further support is needed for SMEs  for obtaining intellectual property rights (IP) for their innovative AI products. As discussed  in 4iP’s study on “The Exploit ation of Intellectual Property for Industrial Innovation”27,  European SMEs focus mainly on the in -house development of their own  technical  solutions and the  use of third -party inventions and patents remains low . Possible  reasons  for this are the lack of awareness and effective IP strateg ies on the part of SMEs, budget  constraints, transaction  costs  and the complexity of processes .

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      26   from the 4iP study included the need for the introduction of several schemes and tools to  support SMEs in their external IP acquisition, including the provision of  funding in the form  of vouchers for obtaining IP, as well as the enhancement of support, via current SME  instrument schemes for obtaining IP and for the use of third -party IP, something relevant  also to the area of AI in healthcare.   In terms of funding o pportunities towards innovative products in the area of AI in  healthcare, the EU may have a disadvantage compared to the US since in the last few  years, all Big Tech corporations (Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft) have  invested in the developm ent of AI technologies with applications in the healthcare sector  and have provided industrial funding to SMEs for developing their innovative products.  Market reports indicate that this funding has been mostly distributed to US -based SMEs  indicating the n eed for the development of strategies with the EU for channelling VC funds  to EU -born ideas, and for considering initiatives to bring Big Tech corporations closer to  EU-based SMEs so as to maintain the competitiveness of EU -based SMEs in the area of  AI in healthcare. Additionally, investments such as those enabled through the European  Investment Fund (EIF)28, indicate that VC investments, especially in areas of lower  economic development within the EU, spur further VC investment and development  thereafter an d supports the continuity and longerity of SMEs across -sector.                                                                                   28 Helmut Kraemer -Eis, Simone Signore and Dario Prencipe, EiF Research and Market Analysis, Working Paper 2016/34 on The European venture capit al landscape:  an EIF perspective Volume I:The impact of EIF on the VC ecosystem, accessible at  https://www.eif.org/news_centre/publications/eif_wp_34.pdf  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      27   3. Level of development, adoption, awareness and use of  AI technologies in the healthcare sector in the EU     a. Level of development of AI in the healthcare sector in the EU   To assess the level of development of AI applications in the healthcare  sector in the EU,  we measured the output of EU MS in terms of scientific publications, patents granted, as  well as the startup ecosystem in the EU as a whole, and per MS.   Scientific Publications   While m any R&D activities in the area of AI in the healthcare sector takes place within  the startup ecosystem, the first stage of the technology -innovation cycle is well -captured  by gaining an understanding of the research output, in terms of  scientific  peer-reviewed   publications from universities and research institutes.    To provide a measure of the level of development of AI in the EU, we applied an elaborate  methodology, explained in detail in Annex I,  aiming to obtain a valid and represent ative  sample  of the EU’s scientific  output in the area of AI in healthcare . We then used this  sample in order to develop  KPIs  describing the share of scientific contribution for each  MS in the area of AI in healthcare , as well as  a measure of the level of collaboration  between MS, resulting in original and innovati ve scientific work  around AI in healthcare.  To obtain a representative sample, several sources of peer -reviewed publication s were  selected, and two sets of keywords, defined for the two fields of interest (AI and  healthcare) were applied.  The  results presented next, represent scientific publications  published between the 1st of January of 2015 and the 31st of August of 2020 . While the  papers used to extract these indices do not represent the entire body of published  research papers in the area of AI in healthcare (which would be nearly impossible to  obtain due to limitations in accessing scientific publication databases and in ambiguity in  the definition of AI and/or healthcare), the sample we obtained is a representative one  and it provides an indication of the state of development of AI in the healthcare sector as  a measure of comparison between the EU Member States.    Following the Nature Index approach29, which is considered to be a valid scientific  approach for deriving individual scientific contributions of institutions or countries in this  instance, as well as  multilateral and bilateral collaboration indices, three indic es were  defined and calculated :    The Fractional Count (FC) Share  index , used as an appropriate and validated  proxy for the Scientific Output of each of the EU -27 Member States.    The Bilateral  Collaboration Score  (BCS ), adopted in order to portray the extent   of collaboration across the EU -27 Member States. The BCS is a measure of the  collaboration between any pair of two countries that have contributed to a scientific  paper.    Lastly, the Multilateral Collaboration Score  (MCS ), adopted in order to portray  the e xtent of collaboration across the EU -27 Member States. The MCS attempts  to measure the overall collaborative character of each country.                                                     29 A guide to the Nature Index. Nature 551, S26 (2017).

The same countries, with a slightly different ranking  (Spain, Italy, Germany, and France), outperformed the rest of the EU -27 Member States  in terms of the MCS and the BCS indices.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      30   Apart from the size of these four countries, we noted the multidisciplinary consortia  involved in many of those countries’ publications,  which include, in many cases,  university hospitals collaborating with ICT de partments for the development of  technologies directly applicable to the clinical sector. Some examples of such hospitals  who appear in scientific publications in the area of AI in healthcare identified in our search,  include University Hospitals of Fuenla brada, Getafe, Asturias, Barcelona, Murcia and  Seville in Spain, Ruggi D’Aragona and Pisa in Italy, Regensburg, Aachen and Heidelberg  in Germany and Clermont -Ferrand, Dijon, Rouen and Lyon in France. Another  observation is the collaborations in many cases of university departments in scientific  publications with large technology corporations, such as Siemens and Philips which are       Figure 8: The Multilateral Collaboration Score for each of the EU -27 Member States.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      31     most likely tied with industrial funding projects between the research institutes and the  technology corporations.    Potential correlations were explored between the EU -27 Member State’s  abovementioned performance and other publicly available indicators30, like the GDP,  R&D contribution (Horizon 202031), size of Popu lation and the Digital Economy and  Society Index (DESI)32. The data comparison reveals that the EU’s largest economies,  namely Germany, Spain, France and Italy, which are ranked in the top four places in  terms of the FC Share, also come first in terms of th e EU funding received for Research  & Innovation via the Horizon 2020 programme (cumulative values for the period 2014 2020). This correlation is far from perfect, as Figure 7 shows some countries performed  better in the FC Share compared to the received H2 020 funding (e.g. Portugal, Greece,  Poland, Romania and Italy), and vice versa for countries like the Netherlands, Belgium  and Austria, where ranking in terms of received H2020 funding was better than their FC  Share.  No correlation between the number of p ublications and the DESI index was found  which indicates that the differentiators are more relevant to research -related factors,  rather than general societal digitalisation indices.   In terms of multilateral collaborations, interestingly, the eight countries with the highest  FC Shares also have the eight higher MCSs.  The top eight  countries in the share of  authorship of scientific papers in the field of AI in healthcare are also the top eight   multilateral research collaborators. These highly ranked countries have relatively large  populations and some of them also share borders.

Another example of such initiatives is  the 2019 Baltic Research Programme  operated by the Latvian Ministry of Education and  Science33, which aims to support , via a EUR 14.5 million research fund, collaborative  research projects between the Baltic countries and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein,  with a view to building a r egional research hub  and strengthening the impact of the  funding via the pooling of cross -border resources. Due to the recency of these  programmes, the effect is not yet be visible in the bilateral collaboration scores, thus, the  measures need to be recalc ulated once some time passes in order to provide a better  assessment of the impact of these initiatives.   The chord diagram in Figure 10 incorporates the Bilateral Collaboration Scores of EU  Member States in order to depict the research collaborations takin g place between the  Member States. Table 2 shows the top collaborating country for each EU Member State,  ranked by Bilateral Collaboration Score .  It is evident that the strongest cross -border  collaborations occur between countries which are either neighbo uring, or share strong  cultural ties (e.g., Italy -Spain and Cyprus -Greece). In addition, countries with a smaller  rank in FC share such as Austria and Ireland appear to be  benefiting from strong  collaborations with a bigger countr y, such as  Germany, to boo st their scientific output in  the area of AI in healthcare.

In the  field of AI in healthcare, Italy is the most outward looking country, ranking  first in terms of  the number of countries (22) with which it collaborates for its scientific output. Despite  that, Germany appears as the top collaborating country for five Member States (the  Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Sweden, and Ireland) indicating s tronger collaboration links  between German research institutions and ones in other EU Member States.   Outside the EU, the top collaborating countries for EU Member States in terms of scientific  publications in the area of AI in healthcare are the UK and th e USA, with joint publications  with 22 EU MS each, followed by Switzerland (11 MS) and China (8 MS). USA appears  in the top 5 collaborating country list of Austria, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany,  Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg and Poland, while it is the number one collaborator of  Belgium in this area. On the other hand, the UK appears in the top 5 collaborating country  list of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Spain and  Sweden and is the number one collaborator of Cyp rus in the area of AI in healthcare. In  the recent years, an increasing number of collaborations can be observed between  research institutions in EU MS and corresponding ones in Asia (mostly China, Japan and  India), however these collaborations are still n ot prominent in terms of the overall scientific 
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      34   output of individual EU MS in this area with only one case of an Asian country (China)  appearing in the top 5 collaborating country list of a single EU MS (Lithuania).     Patents granted on AI technologies an d applications in healthcare   The European Patent Organization  (EPO) database was used to analy se the number of  patents granted  from each Member State . As before, a s earch was conducted using  combinations of AI and healthcare related  keywords  and data mining approaches were  applied to further refine the dataset used.   After conducting the search for patents  granted in the period between 2017 and 2020   relating to AI and healthcare , Germany was ranked first with 62% of total patents granted,  the Netherlands second with 22% and Sweden third with 2.8%. Following, Ireland ha d 15  patents (2.2%), Belgium and France with 13 patents each (1.9%), followed  by Italy with  10 patents (1.47%) and Finland with seven  patents (1%). Further more , Greece, Denmark  and Spain had six patents each (0.88% each), Romania and Portugal at four patents each  (0.58%) and Austria, Poland and Lithuania at three  (0.44%), two (0.30%) and one  (0.15%) , respectively. The sample used in this study did not find patents in the field of AI  in healthcare submitted by the rest of the EU -27 countries.    Analysis was further conducted on Germany and the Netherlands, the top two countries  in the sample in terms of AI in healthcare patents. The analysis proved that in countries  where the number  of patent applications is significantly higher, certain companies are  causing this distinction. For instance, in Germany, approximately 96% of total AI in  healthcare patents are owned by Siemens Healthcare GMBH, while only 4% of the  patents are owned by o ther companies. Likewise , in the Netherlands, approximately 92%  of the total patents identified are owned by Koninklijke Philips and only 8% are owned by  other companies. Therefore, it could be argued that, while these countries are  technologically develop ed, this type of technological development is mainly driven by   large private  corporations . This might restrict the competition of other companies trying  to enter the market. In the rest of the countries , we conside r that the patents in AI  healthcare could be a result of startups.   While this is not a direct indication of the actual  technology developed from each MS (since not all technology proceeds with patenting),  it is an indication of the current trends in obtain ing IP protection for technology developed  which, in turn, is a deciding factor for the commercialisation potential and long -term  viability of companies working on the development of AI technologies in the healthcare  sector.    Moreover, the results of this  study were compared to the publicly available patent  statistics and data provided by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and  European Patent Organization (EPO) respectively.   By looking at the average number of total patent applications fo r the period of 2015 -2018,  calculated by adding the patent applications submitted by residents and non -residents as  provided by the WIPO, Germany again ranks first among EU Member States. From the  average number of patent applications per country of reside nce of the applicant for the  period of 2017 -2020, provided by the EPO, it is also evident that Germany is the leader  among EU countries. In both databases, France is ranked second and both the  Netherlands and Italy are within the top five countries of the EU.    
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      35   Start -up ecosystem relevant to AI technologies and applications in healthcare   A national startup ecosystem consists of various stakeholders and as the concept   “ecosystem ” suggests, there is interdependence between these stakeholders. One can  easily u nderstand that startups are not created overnight, nor do they operate by  themselves or in a vacuum. The factors that contribute to successful startups are  numerous and can range from financial to sociological factors. The presence of  supportive government s, educational institutions, research organi sations, funding  opportunities, incubators and accelerators, coworking spaces, mentors and related  events are some of the main enablers  for the creation of a successful startup  ecosystem.   Through this report , it has become evident that improving one’s startup  ecosystem is  the key to one’s growth and development .    The improvement of a country’s start -up ecosystem is the result of various changes. One  factor observed among EU countries is the  creation of start -up platforms and national  start -up facilitators which are responsible for raising awareness, acting as the key start up network of Member States  and offering support in the form of funding or training.  A  country’s startup ecosystem is more visible and underst andable in the presence of ‘one  stop shop’ initiatives  which are found online in the form of easily accessible and  informative websites.   In many countries, these platforms are usually  developed by government agenc ies or  through partnerships which  may include the government. The Czech Republic, Estonia,  France, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden  have  government -funded platforms and t heir aim is to have a nation al platform to support their  startup ecosystems and serve a s a network  between the various stakeholders of these  ecosystems.   Other Member States have seen the development of similar platforms through private   initiatives. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland,  Romania and Slovakia ar e such examples, with some platforms being led by the private  sector and entrepreneurs. The nature of these platform is usually informative.   Many EU Member States looking to enhance their startup and entrepreneurial  ecosystems are encouraging foreign tale nted entrepreneurs to develop their business  ideas in these countries. This is often achieved through the provision of special visa  schemes and, more specifically, start -up visa schemes. These start -up visa schemes are  provided to non -EU and non -EEA citize ns usually as a form of temporary residence and  are based on their business plans. Countries with such schemes include I taly, France ,  Denmark , Estonia, Cyprus and Lithuania.   Following a specified methodology explained in Annex I, our findings indicate that   Germany has the most start -ups relevant to AI technologies and applications in  healthcare, followed by France and the Netherlands in that order. Based on our findings,  Germany hosts around 16.5% of start -ups in the field of AI in healthcare. At the other end  of the spectrum there are many  Member States which have only a couple of start -ups in  this field. These countries include Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia,  Luxembourg, Malta, Romania and Slovenia.   One important development affecting the start-up ecosystem of Germany and  contributing to its success is the recent introduction of the Digital Healthcare Act34. This  initiative  is driving the digital transformation of the healthcare system of the country and  provides specific  directions for vari ous aspects such as digital health innovations, online  consultations, electronic prescriptions and IT security. The most relevant law is the one  encouraging the use of digital healthcare apps by both patients and health professionals, 
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      36   which will also be re imbursed by the state insurance35. This may be one of the factors  that result in the high number  of startups in Germany.    Level of awareness of topics around AI technologies and applications in  healthcare in news and social media   In the past few years, is has become evident that online news and s ocial media play an  important role in increasing public awareness and in collect ing the views, information and  attitudes toward certain issue s36. That is why social media platforms are now being widely  relied on for the promotion of ideas, social causes and product s; they are an efficient and  inexpensive approach to address barriers such as a lack of engagement, awareness, and  finances. The level of  social media awareness o n AI technologies in healthcare in the EU  MS provides  an indication of how informed citizens are and  may provide insights to  governments and individual organisations for using social media in order to increase  citizen trust in these new technologies and, thus, increase adoption.   The methodology empl oyed for measuring the level of awareness on AI in the healthcare  sector, measures the following two metrics on the basis of combinations of keywords  related to the words “AI” and “healthcare” (see Annex I):   1) The number of mentions of a specific topic (i .e. number of times a specific set of  keywords assumed to define the topic are mentioned online from a specific type of source  - online News or Social Media);   2) The level of engagement on a specific topic (i.e. number of times such an online  publication h as been forwarded, shared or commented on);   For creating the index  presented here , we sum med up the mentions  for each country  during the time period considered, i.e. we use the total mentions and total engagement  over a period of 13 months. These were then  standardised by dividing by the number of  internet users, in order to account for each country's size, and normalised to have  comparable index values. The standardised index ranges from 0 -100 where a value of  over 70 is considered high.   When looking at t he level of awareness raised around AI for health and care across  national online news sources, the EU27 average of 20.63 over a 13 -month period  indicates a rather low level of mentions on this topic. 12 EU MS have an index score  above average, e.g. partic ularly news publications in Portugal, Austria, Sweden, Malta,  Spain, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Ireland, France, Finland, Germany and Italy yet reveal a  comparatively higher awareness.                                                     34 Driving the digital transformation of Germany’s healthcare system for the good of patients.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      37       Overall, news publications are very much event -driven , e.g. linked to summits or EU wide conferences in the field of AI for health. The importance of patient -centeredness   in AI technology development is particularly noteworthy in all countr ies, i.e. the case of  chatbots. It becomes evident that news topics are centred around patients’ interest in  recent innovations, accelerations in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic or  widespread diseases, rather than direct impact on health outco mes.  The contextual analysis of spikes in news publications in all EU Member States  has  resulted in four main thematic clusters:    Spikes of mentions between March and June 2020 in all EU Member States  are  first of all due to the Covid -19 pandemic  and a resu lting rise in awareness  regarding new ways of mitigating the virus through novel AI applications and  technologies. For instance, users show interest in the use of AI applications to  Figure 11: AI in healthcare Awareness Index Score for online news and social media.  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      38   detect Covid -19 via symptoms checkers, to ensure social distancing and hel p  tracing/ tracking the spread of the virus. In that sense, there are mentions of using  AI and ML to investigate genetic factors. A general observation eventually relates  to European citizens’ interest in big data usage to control the spread of the  coronav irus in Asian countries.    The second cluster relates to publications about the use and development of AI  applications for the detection and further prevention  of diseases or  dysfunctions.    The third cluster focuses on the oncological indication . Potential ca ncer  treatments through means of novel technologies, such as AI -powered cancer  screening tools, appear of special interest. Users also discussed automatic  assistance systems that could detect potential cancerous tissue patterns of  gastroenterological type.    Awareness in the press is finally raised around the use of AI -based solutions for  different medical treatments . Thus, there are EU -wide mentions of the  relevance of AI technologies for radiology and cardiac imaging, robotics for  surgical intervention, the  use of AI and Virtual reality to support remote monitoring  of patients. In this context, the role and positioning of multinational technology  companies (i.e. Samsung, Philips) is stressed.   Eventually, other topics mentioned cover elderly people care and m ental health  treatment.   Awareness raised across social media channels, particularly Twitter, point out a similarly  moderate EU27 average scoring 28.45  mentions over a 13 month period . A slightly higher  score yet stresses out the relevance of social media d iscussions on civil society’s  perception of the use and development of AI in healthcare. Comparably to the total  number of countries above EU27 average regarding news publications, with overall 13  countries above -average awareness, there is a clear tendenc y for six countries that are  leading thru both categories: These comprise France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Spain  and Sweden. In general, there is a correlation between the usage of national social media  platforms and awareness around this specific topic .   Whereas sentiments about this topic are rather positive , hashtags are broadly used to  describe the disruptive potential of AI technologies, ML and blockchain. Yet, negative  connotations about that topic appear in tweets and retweets criticizing pressing  ethical  issues  around AI in health parallel to human intelligence and pointing out mistakes of  robotics in medical interventions.   Twitter users in different EU Member States  show involvement around four streams of  discussion, as listed below:    Tweets and retweets around AI for health and care are predominantly event driven. Thus, spikes of publications go along with conferences, congresses and  digital summits providing internet users with insights shared about latest AI  technologies, progress with treatmen ts and highlighting ambitions (i.e. Digital  Summit Berlin, FINnovation Events, conference held by the European Economic  and Social Committee in Helsinki).    Posts are associated with political decisions and actions on national  governmental or EU level . Conce rning this matter, key opinion leaders’  publications coincide with the European Commission’s publication of the White  Paper on AI, announcements regarding the Horizon2020 funds, to name a few. 
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      39   These refer to novel uses of AI and ML in health -related fields  or rather the impact  on personalized medicine. Users express their opinions around national  governments’ announcements of new AI -related activities in different fields,  including ambassadors of those developments.    Multinational (high -)technology players  (i.e. Philips, Google Health) and their  innovative market offerings in this field appear of relevance and influence users’  online awareness. With this regard, users show keen interest in technological  breakthroughs allowing for better accuracy in surgical a nd radiographic  approaches.    Covid -19 has likewise enhanced awareness thru Twitter. Users discuss different  streams of innovation that AI offers to mitigate impacts of the pandemic , such  as predictive diagnosis, statistic modeling to forecast peaks of cont amination, AI based technologies to trace contacts or rather personalized treatments. Moreover,  tweets in most of the EU Member States  highlight the positioning and relevance  of high -tech and med -tech start -ups when managing the Covid -19 crisis.   While is it not possible to correlated news and social media awareness with levels of  adoption on citizen’s sentiments towards the use of AI in the healthcare sector, it is clearly  evident that social media channels can now be utilized by the European Comm ission,  and EU MS alike as channels for increasing awareness around the use of AI and other  technologies in the healthcare sector in order to enhance citizens’ understanding of these  technologies and to build the necessary trust that will lead to improved adoption.   b. Level of adoption of AI in the healthcare sector in the EU   While our survey of users of AI technologies in healthcare, constituting of hospitals and  other healthcare providers, has not yielded statistically significant results, we can analyze   responses to obtain an indication  of the level of adoption of AI in the healthcare sector  and the factors that may be affecting adoption.   Our survey indicates that m ost organizations who responded to the survey are either  currently using or planning to use AI technologies in the next three years with 11% of  them using AI technologies across the entire spectrum of applications included in the  survey, i.e., Medical Robo tics, Disease Diagnosis, Patient Monitoring and Genome  Analysis. The technology most widely used or planned to use in the next three years is  Patient Monitoring (72%) followed by Disease Diagnosis (61%), Medical Robotics (53%),  Other (33%) and Genome Analy sis (31%)37.                                                     37 Genome Analysis is not a technology traditionally used in hospitals as it is m ainly a scientific discipline so the result in terms of responses is to be expected.   Figure 12: Adoption of AI applications by Hospitals and Healthcare Service Providers  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      40   Despite the encouraging numbers of organisations already using or planning to use AI,  responses regarding the number of departments and users of AI technologies within the  organisation were limited, with most respondents indicating that the ap plications were not  still widely used within the organization, with use limited mostly to 1 and up to 3  departments only and used only by specialized staff (a common answer included  “pathology doctors”). It is evident that while some healthcare organisatio ns within the EU  are gradually becoming open to the use of AI technologies, use is still limited within  hospitals and healthcare providers and measures to promote more widespread use are  needed.   In terms of R&D activities taking place within hospitals and  healthcare providers, 50% of  respondents indicated that they are either actively (39%) or sporadically (11%)  collaborating with research institutions, start -ups or the government for the purpose of  translating AI research into practice within their own in stitution. There was no difference  in responses between public and private hospitals. The types of initiatives included in the  responses included collaborations with start -ups, universities (e.g., for joint PhDs), as well  as own research on AI technologies  within the hospitals themselves. In addition, 55% of  organisations indicated that they had received either local of European funding for  purchasing or using AI technologies.          In terms of  where AI Users heard about potential AI technologies to use in their  organisations, healthcare technology agents came out top, followed by technologies  developed internally and government initiatives next. This ind icates the need for targeted  initiatives for engaging healthcare technology agents with developers and products in the  area of AI in healthcare for promoting products and applications in interested  organisations .  Figure 13: Level of adoption of AI tools by the users of AI technologies in healthcare.  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      41   An extra point of view on the level of adop tion of AI technologies, may be derived from  the survey answered by the developers AI technologies  who were asked to indicate  whether their AI -enabled products were already being used by healthcare organisations  or individuals. 44% of respondents replied t hat their products were already in use by  organisations and individuals while the rest (56%) were still in the development phase.   Of the organisations that had purchased AI -enabled technologies, over 90% on average  appear to be actively using them. In ter ms of B2C applications, the most widely used  technologies were in the area of mhealth. Instead, the highest adoption in applications for  use by healthcare professionals were in the area of radiology (Disease Diagnostics).    Lastly, the majority of AI in he althcare developers have acknowledged that they are  actively collaborating with other research institutes/companies/healthcare delivery  cente rs for the translation of AI -related research into healthcare applications .   Success stories from European SMEs dev eloping AI technologies, include:    The Austrian SME, Symptoma, a digital health assistant and symptom checker  that is currently being used by 10 million patients monthly according to the survey.    The Estonian SME Velmio which is actively used by 10,000 pati ents in more than  90 countries.    The Estonian SME, Healthcode AI, which reaches 4000 patients through its AI  Leia Physician.    Another example includes Danish SME, Livalife, which also estimates that 5000  are purchasing and using their digital health coaching  programmes.   Another insight obtained through the survey of AI Developers concerned awareness -of  and collaboration -with organisations aiming to support the translation of their  products into clinical practice and widespread use . The answers to the question “ Are  you aware of public/private organisations within your country that provide support for the  translation of your AI -enabled health care tools into applications? ” showed that most AI  Developers (56.7%)  were not aware of any public or private organisations that could  support them for taking their products to market and only 6.7% were actually receiving Figure 14: Awareness or engagement with organisations to support the translation of AI  research into applications.   
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      42   any support for this. This kind o f support mechanisms, usually facilitated through research  councils, are very important since moving from R&D to application is often reported as a  major hurdle in the success of such innovative technologies. Despite the attention the  European Commission h as placed in developing programs and support mechanisms for  taking products to market38, it appears that developers in the area of AI in healthcare are  still not aware of these schemes or actively engaging with such schemes and this may  be a factor hinderin g both R&D around this area, as well as widespread adoption.   c. Technical Aspects   Major areas of application of AI in the healthcare sector in EU Member States   The literature review conducted at the beginning of this study revealed the extent of the  resea rch and innovation activity around AI in healthcare in the EU Member States  which  focus mainly in the following broad categories:    Patient Monitoring    Genome Analysis    Disease Diagnosis    Medical Robotics   We proceeded to classify the volume of scientific publi cations and start -ups around these  4 broad areas in order to get a picture of the distribution of technologies in the EU as a  whole.    Figure 15  shows the share of scientific publications in each category from the scientific  papers’ sample used in this rep ort. Likewise, Figure 16  shows the share of start -ups in  each category. In the case of start -ups it is worth mentioning that, unlike in the case of  scientific papers,  most companies are working on innovative products which cut across  areas and many compan ies also focus on treatments and end -to-end products that  provide AI -enabled monitoring, diagnosis and decision support. The classification in the  case of start -ups was thus more challenging and results should only be taken as  indicative.   It is evident that the scientific output of the EU as a whole within the field of AI in  healthcare is dominated by the category of Disease Diagnostics by around 42%. This is  then followed by Patient Monitoring  (34%) , Other  (16%) , Medical Robotics  (6.6%)  and  Genome Analysis  (2.4%) , in that order.   On a more granular level, in almost all EU Member States the category of Disease  Diagnostics is again dominant. The only exceptions are Greece, Portugal and Romania  where Patient Monitoring and Disease Diagnostics hav e an equal share and Ireland  where the category of Patient Monitoring dominates slightly.   Approximately  35% of start -ups applying AI in healthcare within the EU work in the area  of Patient Monitoring. Nevertheless, Disease Diagnostics is a close second wi th 33%.  The opportunities presented by patient monitoring applications are numerous with time  and cost savings being two of them. Developing a remote patient monitoring software is  an ambition of many start -up companies in the field of AI in health and car e. Remote  patient monitoring is not limited to the management of certain chronic illnesses but can                                                    38 Europe go to market support for enterpreuneurs -Online tool, accessed at  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/go -to-market  support?g2m_support_types_tid=All&g2m_subtopics_tid=All&g2m_geo_focus_tid_1=74930  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      43   also be focused on elderly patients, patients with mobility problems, patients with limited  access to healthcare facilities and post -surgical patients.   On the other hand, t he use of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing diseases through  medical imag ing has become more common and more accurate through the years.  According to a study in the literature, when deep learning models (part of AI technologies)  were compared to healthcare professionals in studies of any disease, the diagnostic  performance of the two was found to be equivalent39.  In another study an AI system’s  performance was compared to that of 101 radiologists in the topic of cancer detection  accuracy and was found to be similar and non -inferior to that of the healthcare  professionals40. Although these studies are retrospective, they both show that  incorporating AI in disease diagnosis in highly promising.   Image recognition and analysis through AI and in particular, through deep learning has  been transforming healthcare by introducing automation, accuracy and accessibility  improvements and cost reductions.   On the other hand , it is widely accepted that remote monitoring is expected to be one of  the most transformative AI applications in the field of health and care. Remote patient  monitoring has the potential of reducing hospitals’ personnel costs by reducing the  number of ho spital rooms needed and by allowing patients to receive healthcare in the  comfort of their own space and by minimizing the risk of nosocomial infections41.

The European Commission is co -financing the Active & Assisted Living (AAL) program.  This programme has been funding projects that can result in better quality of life for the  EU’s older population and an enhanced market regarding healthy ageing technology and  innovation43.     The AI developers included in the survey were asked whether their AI developm ents are  in the field of healthcare and if so, they were asked to respond according to the areas of  application within healthcare.  It is evident that the two dominating areas of application  within healthcare among AI developers are Disease Diagnostics and  Patient Monitoring.  More than 50% of the respondents and organizations represented in the survey are  developing AI tools relating to Disease Diagnostics and Patient Monitoring. The two less  popular categories within healthcare among AI developers seem to be Medical Robotics  and Genome Analysis. This finding is mainly in line with the classification of total EU  scientific output and start -ups in these 5 different areas of application. There is, however,  a contrast in terms of responses received from hospita ls and healthcare providers who                                                    42 Healthcare’s Digital Future: Telemedicine & R emote Monitoring.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      45   have mainly adopted disease diagnostic applications in their organizations, albeit mostly  in a pilot phase. This contrast may be attributed to    A lack of distinction around the term s diagnosis  and monitoring .   A lack of trust in the use of AI or automation for decision -making compared to the  use as part of a process (Patient Monitoring). It is much easier for both clinicians  and patients to trust a medical procedure whi ch is assisted by software and  automation than to trust a machine -based diagnosis. This is a possible reason for  the contrast between the level of development and adoption of AI -enabled  diagnostic and patient monitoring tools.     Sources, types and characte ristics of data used by AI technologies and  applications deployed in the healthcare sector   The developers of AI technologies and applications in the healthcare sector rely heavily  on good quality data and therefore, were asked to indicate the sources and types of data  they utilize in their developments.    67.2% of the survey responses indicate that the data required for the development of AI  technologies and applications in healthcare are obtained through the organizations’ own  collections via clinical tria ls or other data collections. However, a lot of responses indicate  that AI developers are using private data collections alongside public ones. In particular,  52.5% respondents state that they utilize openly available research databases whereas,  36.1% resp ondents also list hospital EHR systems as their data sources.    Healthcare organizations may find it easier and cheaper to source and access data that  belongs to them when they develop AI technologies.    One of the European Commission's policies is to enhance the interoperability and  exchange of Electronic Health Records across borders within the EU, to digitalize Figure 17: Areas of application for AI Developers.   
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      46   healthcare. Improving access to health data across borders in a secure way will enable  contin uous and improved patient care across the EU and will reduce healthcare costs.  Enhancing the availability of data further encourages the development of AI applications  for healthcare, as it is the main foundation for their development. For example, due the   efforts of the EU, by 2025 most Member States will have introduced ePrescriptions and  Patient Summaries before the full health record will be implemented44.   Regarding the types of data used, 60.7% of the developers included in the survey use  Imaging data . This corresponds to the high level of AI technologies and applications  being developed in the specific field of disease diagnosis, where the use of imaging data  is essential.  There are 3 types of data which have relatively similar popularity among the  survey’s AI developers, and these are: vital sign data, pathology data and  unstructured data (text) . On the contrary, the least popular type among our sample is  that of Biochemical data.  Lastly, when asked about their attitude towards the use and  sharing of O pen Data, AI developers  do not depict clear preferences. 77% of  respondents   do not share their data, of which 52% use other open data.  Only 23.0% of the survey’s  AI developers  is using open data from open databases and is, at the same time,  willing to con tribute to open databases . Work still needs to be in order to educate  people on the importance of Open Data and the subsequent benefits such as its need in  the development of AI technologies and applications for healthcare.   ‘Shaping Europe’s digital futur e’ includes among others, increased access to high -quality  data in the most secure way possible and the creation of a European health data space  to encourage research, diagnosis and treatment45. Envisioning the creation of a single  market for data in the EU  has tremendous potential and can transform the European  economy into an attractive, secure and dynamic data economy.                                                                44  Electronic cross -border health services.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      47   4. Stakeholders’ views regarding the development,  adoption and use of AI technologies and applications in  the healthcare sector   a. Views regarding the use of AI in healthcare   Patient sentiment is crucial in order to understand the impact of incorporating AI -based  technologies and applications in healthcare holistically. Patients are key stakeholders in  the healthcare sector and their perceptions regarding AI can have a trickle -down effect in  society. Since no data from patients was collected as part of our survey, we focused on  extracting information from a number of studies  in literature which depict patients’  perceptions either on th e use of AI in healthcare in general or on the use of specific AI  tools.    A common theme that emerges from literature relates to the notion of trust and whether  humans and, especially, patients can trust AI -powered medicine and healthcare  services.  Despite  the hype surrounding AI and the potential benefits it can bring to the  healthcare sector, patients tend to question whether AI will harm human engagement,  empathy and involvement.  As suggested46, resistance to AI stems from the idea that such  technologies cannot understand and process patients’ unique characteristics and will thus  not provide personalized outcomes. Disbelief among patients has also been observed in  the context of mental illnesses, where they believe that complex mental illnesses cannot  be understood by machines.   The EU’s focus on creating a strong link between AI and trust is highly relevant in the  healthcare sector. As indicated by literature, patients and other stakeholders are not  convinced that they can foster a relationship of trust wit h AI-powered tools and machines.   In the context of skin cancer screening for example, although patients are receptive to  the use of AI, they highlight the importance of a symbiotic relationship between humans  and AI47. This point of view is further exempli fied by the fact that when asked about the  creation of an AI -power virtual nurse assistant, the majority of patients assert that doctors  are the ones who should be trusted for this task48. Moreover, only half of a group of  patients with chronic conditions b elieve that the use of AI in healthcare represents an  exciting opportunity and only a minority would be willing to integrate biometric wearable  devices and AI into their care plans49.   Interestingly, in another study, both the public and the patients empowe r the clinician and  would prefer it if the clinician oversaw the final decision -making process rather than  machine learning algorithms50.                                                      46 Longoni, C., Bonezzi, A. & Morewedge, C.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      48   Nevertheless, one cannot deny that there are positive connotations associated with the  incorporation of AI in health and care. In a cross -sectional study, the majority of patients     Despite the excitement of heart and circulatory patients regarding AI and its use in  diagnosis and treatment, it is also found that only 17% of these patients are actually aware  of the current uses and applications of AI in this field51. Therefore, one may infer that the  public’s awareness re garding artificial intelligence tools and applications in the healthcare  is insufficient. Negative public or patient perception may be driven from misinformation of  the topic or lack thereof.   Responses from our survey, confirm the issues of trust and the need for collaborative  machine -clinician decision -making for increased acceptance of AI technologies in the  healthcare sector, even by healthcare professionals.  When potential users of AI  technologies were asked to indicate their attitude towards the use of AI tools within their  organization, with respect to the balance between AI -enabled decisions and expert  judgement the overwhelming majority responded that they trust AI results in combination  with expert judgement. AI -enabled decisions were trusted most ly for applications of  Patient Monitoring (25%), followed by Genome Analysis (22%), Medical Robotics (19%).  Only 3% of respondents would trust an AI -enabled diagnostic decision. In contrast, 89%  of respondents would “trust AI -results in combination with ex pert judgment” in the case of  Disease Diagnosis, 75% in the case of Medical Robotics, 69% for patient monitoring and  66% for Genome Analysis. This indicates  that individuals are more likely to trust AI when  they associate it to a process rather than with a decision.     b. Views regarding barriers to adoption   The survey identified specific barriers related to the utilization and implementation of AI  systems by health professionals in the health sector and asked AI developers to provide  their own opinions on the relevance of these barriers.  Around 80% of the AI developers  agree, either strongly or somewhat agree, that the lack of understanding of AI  technologies slows down the rate of implementation and utilization of AI systems by  health professionals in the healthcare sector. Moreover, AI developers strongly be lieve  that the lack of trust in AI and the lack of IT knowledge and competencies are two barriers                                                    51TechUK WEBPAGE.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      49   which significantly impede the uptake of AI systems by health professionals. On the Users  side, while they acknowledge the benefits that AI can bring to their  everyday work (See  figure 19), lack of training and lack of trust are also acknowledged as barriers to the more  widespread adoption of AI.   Via the survey, it is also evident that developers of AI technologies and applications in  healthcare believe that t hese technologies and applications can have a positive impact  on various aspects and stakeholders of the sector.  Many identify a link between better  diagnostic accuracy, timely detection of various diseases, enhanced therapy and better  treatment plans for patients, which directly affects the quality of healthcare they receive  and their lives. These benefits are also linked with the ability of AI technologies and  applications to support doctors in their decision making and hence, improve  quality.  Automation and improved efficiency of processes can help  free up time from  doctors and other healthcare professionals, who will be able to devote more time for  productive tasks and human interactions, according to AI developers. These changes will  also have a positiv e impact on the quality of healthcare received by patients.  Moreover,  it is commonly stated that such technologies and applications will manage to reduce  costs, impacting healthcare organizations’ finances and making healthcare more  accessible.  Most of the  responses are focused on the impact accruing to the patient and  hence, again exemplify the concept of patient centricity .   Users of AI technologies in the healthcare sector agree that the use of AI systems by  healthcare professionals is useful for their jobs and task, enhance the effectiveness of  their job and improve quality of care.     Regarding the barriers of using these AI systems within the healthcare sector, more than  80% of respondents agree, either totally or somewhat, that the lack of financial resources  and lack of training are two such barriers.  When asked about the potential positive  impacts of AI systems in the healthcare sector, around 95% of r espondents agree that  these systems can lead to an improvement in the quality of diagnosis decisions. Also,  more than 90% of AI users agree, either totally or somewhat, that AI systems in  healthcare can improve the quality of treatment and more than 80% ag ree that they can  make working processes much faster and more efficient.    Despite having fewer responses from Public Authorities, it is useful to understand the  perspectives coming from Ministries, Public Authorities and National Funding Bodies  regarding t he topic of AI in healthcare.   Figure 19: AI Users’ statements regarding the use and impact of AI technologies in  healthcare.  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      50   When the respondents were asked to list some of the barriers, challenges and enablers  regarding the adoption of AI technologies in healthcare across all healthcare delivery  centers, some common patterns are identified from th eir answers. Approximately 50% of  respondents list the lack of relevant policies and legislation as well as, strategic direction  at a national level as the obstacles to the adoption of AI in healthcare. More than 50%  also list the increased need for fundin g and investments. Another observation derived  from the responses is that without good quality digital infrastructure and healthcare data  it is very difficult to develop and adopt these technologies in the healthcare sector.                                               
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      51     5. Insights   Analysis of the findings of our study with regards to the level of development and adoption  of AI in the healthcare sector in the EU provides insights into the factors which are  hindering the wider adoption of AI in the healthcare sector and whic h may provide a basis  for policy development and strategic planning. These fall under six categories on which  we elaborate next.       Policy and Legal Framework   While  aspects of the use of AI in healthcare may be covered by existing legislation around  the data protection, the use of EHRs, as well as trademark laws .  The nature of  applications  of AI in healthcare , as well as the risks and ethical aspects relevant i n the  use of AI for medical decision making requires special attention and a possibly more   stringent regulatory framework and legislation. Based on our findings, the priority areas  for the development of legislation around the use of AI in healthcare conce rn ethical  requirements to ensure transparency, verifiability and predictability of AI systems, policies  around the introduction of certifications for the use of AI in healthcare, as well as  amendments to existing laws around competition and copyright, in addition to  data  protection  laws regarding the use and exchange of health data, in particular for the use  in research and innovation in the area of AI in healthcare.    Figure 20: Insights related to the development and adoption of AI in the healthcare sector .  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      52   Strategic Direction and Investment   Despite 20 EU M ember States  having already published an AI strategy, there is little  mention of strategic initiatives targeting applications in healthcare ,  in particular. At the  same time, research organizations working on the development of AI applications in  healthcare are still largely reliant on public investments and the calls targeting AI in the  healthcare sector in particular are limited. Stakeholders identify a need for  strategic  direction  for the improvement in the development and adoption of AI technologies in the  healthca re sector. National -level strategic initiatives are needed to foster cross -border  collaboration in R&D  (since especially for smaller EU MSs, as it is evident that close  collaboration with larger more technologically advanced MSs provides a benefit), to  increase citizen awareness and trust  in AI technologies and to support the translation  of AI research into clinical practice . On the funding side, there is a need of specialized  funds  for the development of data standards and formats  (to encourage EU -wide  collaborations) and for participation in international standardization processes, as well as  funding (and improved processes) for SMEs for obtaining IP on their innovative  products  so that the market is not monopolized by the large technology corporations.   Strategic initiatives supporting networking and providing access to innovation funding  and venture capital  are also initiatives which will improve the prospects of AI  technologies making it to the market and to clinical practice thereof.   Access to and use  of healthcare data   There is momentum around the establishment of legislation and standards for the use of  EHRs, however, these apply only to public -lead initiatives, and s takeholders highlight  access to and sharing of data in the private sector as a major  hurdle for the further  development of AI technologies in the healthcare sector. Our study revealed that only a  small percentage of AI developers (23%) are willing to share their own data  with  other developers, while almost 50% of developers use publicly available open data for  their own work. Data is still viewed as a competitive advantage by AI developers and it is  likely that a better regulatory framework around IP  and the use of third -party data would  improve this attitude. On a national level , delays in the implementation of EHRs in some  Member States, as well as common infrastructures for the cross -border exchange of such  data presents a hurdle . To facilitate this, accelerating the implementation of cyber  security directives  locally as required by the EU Directive on security of network and  information systems (NIS) is a necessity.   Skills Gap   Stakeholders identify a skills gap which hinders the widespread adoption of AI in the  healthc are sector in the EU. Lack of training, IT knowledge and competencies in both  patients and health professionals, as well as a lack of understanding of AI have been  highlighted by respondents as challenges. At the same time, looking at the responses of  public authorities and health professionals, the skills gap goes both ways  in that a need  is identified to create AI technologies which are easy to integrate into current clinical  workflows and clinical practice. Success models reveal the need for collaborativ e R&D  activities involving multi -disciplinary teams of AI experts and clinicians  such that  technologies are built in a way that they can be integrated, and thus accepted, by health  professionals and such that clinicians are equipped to use them. As way to foster this, is  the establishment of University Hospitals . Indeed, the existence of university hospitals  in EU Member States has been shown to be a factor contributing to the scientific output  in the area of AI in healthcare.  Initiatives and legislation providing reskilling  opportunities  and support to employees in the health sector whose job is at risk due to 
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      53   AI technologies  is a way to address the skills gap and to build more confidence and  acceptance of the new status.     Trust in AI for medical decision -making   While the  majority of respondents indicated that they would trust AI -enabled medical  decisions in combination with  expert judgement  across applications, there is a lack of  trust in AI -only systems, more so for systems of disease diagnosis . The issue  of trust  and  the need for culture -building  is a prominent response when stakeholders were asked to  identify challenges to adoption. The introduction of legislation around ethical use,  transparency and explainability , as well the introduction of AI certifications  and  benchmarking  for medical use are initiatives which may help towards the acceptability  of AI technologies in healthcare but it is also acknowledged that understanding of AI  technologies through education and reskilling initiatives  may p rove decisive for the  more widespread acceptance.   Translation of research to clinical practice   The translation of AI research into clinical practice is a major hurdle, attested by the fact  that over 50% of SMEs have still not taken their products to marke t. Additionally, even in  the case that AI technologies have made it into hospitals and medical practices, use is  confined to single departments and a limited number of users. At the same time, the long  and laborious process of obtaining IP is a hindering f actor for SMEs for protecting their  products and gaining a market advantage. While there are a number of initiatives for  supporting organisations for taking their innovative products to market, SMEs are not  aware of the support mechanisms available  very fe w are actively engaging with them for  support.  More awareness  is therefore necessary.  The establishment of improved  legislation around copyright and IP , as well as funding support  for obtaining it will  improve the translation of R&D into applications. Add itionally, consortia consisting of  industry, universities/research institutes and hospitals for the translation of research into  clinical practice seem to be very beneficial in cases that they have been used and such  schemes should be further established a nd supported  by the EC and local  governments. In most cases, these collaborations are mostly possible between big  technology corporations via industrial funding but funding should be provided to further  support the development of such relationships for SME s as well so that the innovation  pool around AI in healthcare widens.   Related to both the skills gap and issues of trust,  technology transfer will be further supported through the digital upskilling of healthcare  professionals so that they acquire the co mpetence, trust and acceptance of AI systems.  At the same time, cultural variations across nations and organizational or domain  culture -based differences are factors that influence the success of technology  transfer  and these should also be addressed through EC -level and national -level  initiatives.  The establishment of cross -disciplinary and cross -cultural consortia are  initiatives that have been shown to cultivate a common understanding and to support the  transfer o f technology into clinical practice.

Methodological approach for determining scientific peer reviewed publications in area of AI in healthcare   To provide a Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time -Bound (SMART) KPI  indicative of each Member States ’ scientific peer -reviewed publications output related to  Artificial Intelligence technologies and applications in healthcare we selected the  “Percentage of scientific publications contributed by authors from each EU Member State”  and the corresponding ran k amongst the EU -27.   To collect publication data, we developed computer scripts in Python and used them with  APIs available by scientific publishers in combination with web crawling tools.   Sources   To derive a statistic regarding the respective contribut ion of each EU Member state to the  peer-reviewed publication output related to AI technologies and applications in healthcare  we selected a number of sources of peer -reviewed publications based on the following  criteria    Relevance of academic publishers wit h the topic of AI in healthcare based on  literature review performed as part of Task 1.1.    Relevance of academic publishers with the topic of AI in healthcare based on top  1000 articles identified by Google Scholar52.   Accessibility to full article informatio n via the publishers’ search engine including  title, abstract, list of authors and respective academic affiliations.    The publishers’ which were thus selected for performing the publication search were:    Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE) Publishing via  IEEExplore53   Elsevier Academic Press via Science Direct54    Springer International Publishers via SpringerLink55    Sage Journals56  Approach: Definition of keywords, sampling approach and quality review   With regards to definition of the keywords and designing and translating queries , an  iterative review and validation process was used to retrieve the data from the different  search engines.                                                     52 It was not possible to use “Google  Scholar”  as a single source for performing the journal article search because of limitations in the accessibility to journal  article  information  since only 1000 papers are available for each search query which limits the ability to process the data sati sfactorily for deriving the selected KPIs.   53 Advancing Technology for Humanity.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      55      First, two sets of English keywords  were defined for the two fields of interest, e.g.  related to AI  and healthcare, based on a review of literature, articles and social  media posts, as well as input from the team’s experts. While the list is not  exhaustive, the list was deemed adequate for providing a measure of the  respective scientific output in the a rea of AI in healthcare.   o The final set of English keywords used in the query related to AI were:  “artificial intelligence” or “AI” or “A.I”. or “machine learning” or “deep  learning” or “neural networks” or “natural language processing” or  “predictive anal ytics” or “machine intelligence” or “knowledge engineering”  or “robotics” or “decision support” or “image processing” or “machine  vision” or “novelty detection” or “anomaly detection” or “bioinformatics” or  “data mining” or “early warning systems”.   o The fin al set of keywords used in the query related to healthcare included  the following: “health” or “health care” or “health -care” or “healthcare” or  “care” or “patient” or “health” or “nurse” or “nursing” or “public health” or  “medic*” or “disease” or “patient  monitoring” or “treatment” or “radiology”  or “medical imaging” or “ambient living” or “diagnos*” or “early prediction”  or “smart alert” or “electronic health records” or “electronic medical  records”.    The queries constructed in each search engine consisted  of a combination of the  AI and Healthcare keywords divided by the word “and”.    In the construction of the query we limited the time period of search to papers  published between the 1st of January of 2015 and the 31st of August of 2020.    After running the query on each search engine using our scripted python code  papers were extracted and stored in a database with the following information  stored: Title, keywords, author names, author affiliations.    After the papers were assigned to a country of origin 5482  papers were left which  were assigned to authors from the EU -27.   We then proceeded to filter the database to include only publications originating  from EU -27 academic institutions based on the assigned country of origin.    We then proceeded to manually revi ew the remaining list of papers and removed  papers which were not relevant to the topic and were included in the list as a result  of relevance to some keywords in the search query, ending up removing a total of  22% of publications, leaving a list of 4264 p apers which were the most relevant  papers to AI in healthcare originating from EU -based authors57.    As a last step, we calculated three indices from the final list of papers all of which  were based on the Nature Index approach, which is considered to be a s cientific  valid approach for deriving scientific contributions between institutions or  countries in this instance. The three indices were calculated as follows:                                                     57 Despite the different number of publications extracted from each academic publisher’s search engine, we did not perform a str atified sampling approach and kept  the filtered database intact based on the fact that some academic publishers were more directly relevant to the topic of AI in healthcare compared to some others and  were thus expected to publish a larger number of papers on the topic than others.    
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      56   o Fractional Count (FC)  for which we assigned a fractional contribution of  each paper to each country based on the ratio of authors from that country  compared to the total number of authors. The total FC for a county is  calculated by summing the relative contributions over all p apers. As this  FC index is derived from a representative sample of papers and not from  a complete population, we then converted this number into a percentage  contribution per EU Member State ( FC Share ).  o Multilateral collaboration score (MCS),  which was der ived by first  dividing the total fractional contribution for each country by one less than  the total number of institutions which collaborated on the article.  This is  done for each collaborating country and the values are summed for each  pair of countries  to give the total MCS for that pair on an article. The MCS  for each country is the sum of the values from each of its pairs of countries  over all papers.   o Bilateral collaboration score (CS)  was calculated any two countries co authoring at least one articl e. It is derived by summing the fractional  contributions from articles with authors from both countries. The  collaboration score between two countries is the sum of each of their  fractional contributions on the papers to which both have contributed     h. Methodological approach for determining granted patents in  the area of AI in healthcare   To provide a Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time -Bound (SMART) KPI  indicative of each Member States ’ scientific granted patents related to Artificial  Intelligence technologies and applications in healthcare we selected the “Percentage of  granted patents contributed by authors from each EU Member State” and the  corresponding rank amongst the EU -27.   Sources and timeframe   To derive a statistic regarding t he respective contribution of each EU Member state to the  peer-reviewed publication output related to AI technologies and applications in healthcare  we used the Espacenet58 patent search tool which is an online service for searching  patents and patent appli cations developed by the European Patent Office (EPO) together  with the Member States  of the European Patent Organisation. We selected this tool since  it contains information on published patent applications and granted patents from over  100 patent -grantin g authorities, it is thus considered to provide a comprehensive  overview of the patent applications submitted and granted worldwide.   Approach: Definition of keywords, sampling approach and quality review   With regards to definition of the keywords and desi gning and translating queries ,  similarly to the peer -reviewed journal applications search, a concise review and validation  process was used to retrieve the data.    First, two sets of English keywords  were defined for the two fields of interest, e.g.  related to AI and healthcare, based on a review of literature, articles and social  media posts, as well as input from the team’s experts.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      57   exhaustive, the list was deemed adequate for providing a measure of the  respective scientific output in the area of AI in healthcare.    The final set of English keywords used in the query related to AI were: “artificial  intelligence” or “AI” or “A.I”. or “machine learning” or “deep learning” or “neural  networks” or “natural language  processing” or “predictive  analytics” or “machine  intelligence” or “knowledge engineering” or “robotics” or “decision support” or  “image processing” or “machine vision” or “novelty detection” or “anomaly  detection” or “bioinformatics” or “data mining” or “early warning systems”.   o The final set of keywords used in the query related to healthcare  included  the following: “ health” or “health care” or “health -care” or “healthcare” or  “care” or “patient” or “health” or “nurse” or “nursing” or “public health” or  “medic*” or “disease” or “pa tient monitoring” or “treatment” or “radiology”  or “medical imaging” or “ambient living” or “diagnos*” or “early prediction”  or “smart alert” or “electronic health records” or “electronic medical  records”.   o The query constructed consisted of a combination of the AI and Healthcare  keywords divided by the word “and”.   o In the construction of the query we limited the time period of search to  patents granted between the 1st of January of 2017 and the 31st of Augus t  of 202059.    After running the query using our scripted python code patent information was  extracted and stored in a database with the following information stored: Title,  keywords, author names, author affiliations.    We then proceeded to assign a country or origin to each publication in the  following way by assigning to each paper the country from which the majority of  authors were affiliated with via the academic or business affiliation stated in the  paper . In the case that there was no majority, the pate nt was assigned to the  country of affiliation of the 1st author of the patent .    After the papers were assigned to a country of origin 845 patents were left which  were assigned to authors from the EU -27.   We then proceeded to filter the database to include o nly patents  originating from  EU-27 organisations based on the assigned country of origin.    We then proceeded to manually review the remaining list of papers and removed  papers which were not relevant to the topic and were included in the list as a result  of relevance to some keywords in the search query, ending up removing a total of  24% of patents, leaving a list of 642 papers which were the most relevant papers  to AI in healthcare originating from EU -based authors .    As a final step, we calculated the percentage of papers originating from each EU  country and ranked them in by percentage.                                                      59 We used the 1st of January of 2017 as the starting date of our query based on the knowledge that the period of time for a pat ent application to be submitted and  processed is approximate ly three to five years ( https://www.epo.org/service -support/faq/procedure -law.html#faq -274) so this time period for granted patents includes  innovation produced in the 3-5 years prior to granting.  
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      58   i. Methodological approach for identifying start -ups working on  AI technologies and applications in healthcare   To identify start -ups w orking in the area of AI in healthcare in the EU Member States  we  ran searchers on well -known and credible start -up search portals and enhanced the  information using local knowledge in each Member State and desk research.   Sources and timeframe   To develop a first list of start -ups working in the area of AI in healthcare we used a  combination of sources as follows:    The crunchbase60 company search platform which provides business information  about private and public companies, and specifically the advanced sea rch engine   of Crunchbase which allows searches to be performed using specific keywords  and by specifying the country where the company headquarters are.    Tracxn61, a market intelligence platform for tracking start -ups and private  companies spread across 300+ technology areas.    Desk research   Approach: Definition of keywords, sampling approach and quality review   Our approach for creating a comprehensive list of star t-ups in EU Member States  working  on AI in healthcare consisted of the following steps:    First, two sets of English keywords  were defined for the two fields of interest, e.g.  related to AI and healthcare, based on a review of literature, articles and socia l  media posts, as well as input from the team’s experts. While the list is not  exhaustive, the list was deemed adequate for providing a measure of the  respective scientific output in the area of AI in healthcare.    The final set of English keywords used in the query related to AI were: “ artificial  intelligence” or “AI” or “A.I”. or “machine learning” or “deep learning” or “neural  networks” or “natural language  processing” or “predictive analytics” or “machine  intelligence” or “knowledge engineering” or “robo tics” or “decision support” or  “image processing” or “machine vision” or “novelty detection” or “anomaly  detection” or “bioinformatics” or “data mining” or “early warning systems”.   o The final set of keywords used in the query related to healthcare  included  the following: “ health” or “health care” or “health -care” or “healthcare” or  “care” or “patient” or “health” or “nurse” or “nursing” or “public health” or  “medic*” or “disease” or “patient monitoring” or “treatment” or “radiology”  or “medical imaging” or “ ambient living” or “diagnos*” or “early prediction”  or “smart alert” or “electronic health records” or “electronic medical  records”.   o For our search in the Crunchbase we used combinations of the above  keywords specifying the country where the company was he adquartered,  and that the status of the company was “active”.   o We then proceeded to extract in a database the list of companies  headquartered at each Member State together with the company url and  keyword description.   
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      59   o We then ran a different search in Tr acxn using in each case the search “AI  in healthcare start -ups in Austria/Belgium/etc” and extracted the company  information which we added to the existing database.   o As a last step we proceeded to perform three rounds of desk research  using combinations o f the AI and healthcare related keywords described  above and the name of the country to identify additional start -ups which  had not already been identified using the previous two searches.   o For every start -up in the database we manually reviewed the compan y  website to verify   1. That the company was still active   2. That the company worked in an area related to AI technologies and  applications in healthcare.   3. That the company was indeed headquartered at an EU Member State.    The resulting filtered and verified list consisted of 210 start -ups working on AI  technologies and applications in healthcare whose headquarters are at an EU  Member State.    o As a final step, we calculated the percentage of start -ups in each EU  country.       j. Annex I.V Methodological approach for news and social media  listening   We selected a type of metric commonly used in news and social media monitoring for  measuring awareness of AI in the healthcare sector within the EU, e.g. “ Number of  mentions of a specific topic ” (i.e. number of times a specific set of keywords assumed to  define a specific topic are mentioned online).   To collect web data, a social listening tool was required. The tool had to be able to scan  all public news articles and public social  media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) sites,  across the 27 EU Member States . The selected tool, the Digital Intelligence Platform,  collects data from 150 million public sources and covers sources in over 180 languages.  The tool uses keywords and Boolean  operators, along with advanced analytics with  artificial intelligence capabilities, to allow for the extraction of the most relevant data.   Sources and timeframe   Two types of sources were included, e.g. news and social media (i.e. Twitter, Facebook,  YouTu be, with most results coming from Twitter). While typically covered by the platform,  for the current analysis, Instagram results were excluded. Instagram produced higher  levels of irrelevant results compared to the other sources. Additionally, its content (mainly  visual in nature, i.e. images, drawings) was found to differ highly from the other web  sources (news sites, blogs, Twitter), which were mainly text.                                                     60 Crunchbase webpage.

Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence    for Health and Care in the European Union      60   With regards to the timeframe, 13 months’ worth of data was extracted from the platform  for each c ountry. All data were published online between May 4, 2019 and June 24, 2020.   Approach: Definition of keywords and “queries” to retrieve pertinent and coherent  real time data within the scope of the study   Using the Digital Intelligence Platform to retrieve  data requires the development of  queries, which are requests for information from a database written in a specialized  language (which in this case involves using Boolean operators).   With regards to definition of the keywords and designing and translating queries , an  iterative review and validation process was used to retrieve the data from the Digital  Intelligence Platform.    First, two sets of English keywords  were defined for the two fields of interest, e.g.  related to AI and healthcare, based on a review of literature, articles and social  media posts, as well as input from experts using the platform.    This list was reviewed and edited by subject matter experts and then tested by a  linguistic expert on the platform in order to increase the relevance of resul ts and  reduce the amount of “noise” as much as possible.    The keywords were translated into 22 additional languages  (cf. listed below)  corresponding to the 27 EU Member States  and revised by Native speakers in  order to ensure quality. Maltese was excluded.   o The final set of English keywords related to AI included the following:  artificial intelligence, AI, A.I., machine learning, deep learning, neural  networks, natural language  processing, predictive analytics, machine  intelligence, knowledge engineering, robotics, clinical decision support,  image processing, machi ne vision, novelty detection, anomaly detection,  bioinformatics, data mining, early warning systems.   o The final set of keywords related to healthcare included the following:  health, health care, health -care, healthcare, care, patient, health, nurse,  nursing , public health, medic*, disease, patient monitoring, treatment,  radiology, medical imaging, ambient living, diagnos*, early prediction,  smart alert, electronic health records, electronic medical records.   o Based on keyword translations, we created an automa tion that generates  automatically the query in each language . We performed a quality  check  on queries results for each country within the defined time period.   o If results were not related to the use of AI in the healthcare sector, we  decided to exclude the problematic keyword that caused the noise or link  this word to another word related to healthcare or AI in order to get only  relevant results. The following example is illustrative of the important  results of this exclusion step. A keyword first selected f or the healthcare Bulgarian  Croatian  Czech  Danish  Estonian  Finnish  French   German  Greek  Hungarian  Italian  Latvian  Lithuanian  Luxem bourgish   Dutch  Polish  Portuguese  Romanian  Slovak  Slovenian  Spanish   Swedish        
Study on eHealth, Interoperability of Health Data and Artificial Intelligence   for Health and Care in the European Union      61   dimension included “treatment”: The output for Cyprus showed that most  of the results not related to health were a result of the keyword “treatment”.  Thus, we had to be link “treatment” to other words related to health, e.g.  (treatment NE AR/10 (patient OR disease OR medicine)).   o After validation of all keywords , queries  were constructed using special  Boolean operators stipulating that a set of keywords must be near certain  others. The AI -related keywords were connected to the healthcare  dimension keywords with an allowed distance of 20 or fewer words in  between. Furthermore, the “treatment” related keyword was connected to  the other possible keywords in healthcare with a distance of 10 or fewer  words (cf. above). These Boolean operators allo w a higher probably for  relatedness between two sets of keywords, and thus higher likelihood for  the result to be relevant to the dimension.   o The final element of the query was the geo -localization operator. The  location is determined by the platform based on the metadata available for  the result, according to the following order:   1) the geo -location of the article/post, if enabled by user;   2) location found within the contact/profile section (i.e. a company address or a Twitter  profile’s selected location);   3) if news or website, the IP address or if social media, the posting language (designated  to the country with the most speakers of tha t language).   For all queries in languages other than English, the geo -localization was applied only for  the countries which have that language an official language, i.e. German language query  was appended only with the country filters for Germany and Aust ria.  o Once the quality check and exclusion were completed and geo -location  added, we triggered the historical data on the platform for the indicated  time period.   o We finally performed a review on the data we collected from the platform  for each country, focu sing on peaks. We looked at the top authors (in terms  of volume of results) and assessed the relevancy and quality of their  content. In this instance, we decided to exclude 3 authors that produced a  large amount of low -quality data and that appear to be bo ts, or automated  spam accounts.   Once the inserted queries were finalized and tested, we examined the results over time  for both news and social media sources to describe and analyse the trends per country.

Considering the  objectives of this study, the timeline and resources  available, all the healthcare stakeholders in the EU could not be surveyed. Therefore, a  sample from the population was selected and surveyed. As the topic of AI in healthcare  included multiple stakehol ders with different relevant indicators, we developed three  different questionnaires, targeting three different stakeholder groups:    AI developers : this group included universities, research organisations and  companies working on the development of AI techn ologies and applications in the  healthcare sector.    AI users : this group included hospitals, medical centres and healthcare services  providers.    Public Authorities : this group included Health Ministries, National Health  Authorities and Public Funding Organ isations.   To obtain a representative sample of responses, our aim was to obtain at least 5  responses in each group for each EU Member State. The table below indicates the  number of responses obtained for each stakeholder group. We had a minimum of x  answer s obtained from each EU MS.
