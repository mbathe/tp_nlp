March 7, 2022   ADP:   Ethics in Artificial Intelligence     ADP is a leading global technology company that supports tens of millions of people in 140  countries with its comprehensive human capital management solutions. With over 70 years  of experience responding to changing workforce needs with insights and soluti ons, ADP has  built a legacy of innovation and service. This legacy has yielded ADP a profound  understanding of the lives of people and their success in the world of work and has  embedded within the organization a great respect for the trust placed in ADP.       ADP holds the trust of its clients and their employees at the heart of its mission, vision and  values. First and foremost, we are committed to upholding strong ethics as part of our core  business approach —not just because we believe it gives us a comp etitive advantage, but  because it is the right thing to do. Our associates reflect this every day in their actions and  commitments, including placing a great focus on Privacy .     As technology evolves, new opportunities arise; with them, however, can come the  potential for unintended effects. Automation fueled by artificial intelligence (AI) is helping  transform organizations  by reimagining the way we work, and even the nature of the work  itself. Machine learning (ML), a branch of AI, allows machines to make decisions by feeding  them data to learn on their own, without constant human supervision. ML is helping  accelerate innov ation by reducing the time required for process -driven work and providing  opportunities to perform tasks more effectively, quicker, and at a scale that exceeds human  capacity.   Aspects of this automation are at work today: identifying discrepancies in payr oll registries,  automating the completion of forms, or providing recommendations for financial programs  or retirement offerings. While powering positive advancements, ML applications can  potentially have negative implications as well, such as arriving at i ncorrect  recommendations or amplifying factors of bias. To counter such impacts, ADP has adopted a  rigorous set of principles and processes to govern its use of newer technologies, including  real-time, operational monitoring of automated decisions, much in  the same way we  monitor transaction and payroll processing. This awareness ensures that our models are  relevant and functional, and do not “drift” from their intended goal unknowingly or  inappropriately.    
    ADP, the ADP logo, and Always Designing for People are trademarks of ADP, Inc.          Included in this approach is the isolation of u nintended bias. Bias in the world of work —that  is, favoring or disfavoring one group compared with another —is caused by a variety of  factors. Ethically, anyone developing ML technologies should be vigilant not to reproduce  such bias in any ML -enabled produ ct or service. Even when accounting for potential  unintentional bias in the source data, coding, or use of an AI -enabled product or service,  there can be unexpected or unforeseen bias that come into play. ADP’s goal is to continually  strive to identify new  and unexpected sources of bias and then refresh and enhance the  design of our client offerings to address them.   We at ADP believe it is important to abide by the following core set of guiding principles,  which put people at the center of everything we do :   1. Human Oversight.   ADP believes that human oversight is essential to the reliable  operation of ML models and making proper use of their results. Our solutions provide  recommendations to human decision -makers, which they can then decide how to act  upon.    2. Governance .  While  AI holds the potential to mitigate human bias, without proper  oversight it can incorporate bias as well.  We have implemented audit and risk  assessments to test our ML models as the baseline of our oversight methodologies.   We continue to actively monitor  and improve our models and systems to ensure that  changes in the underlying data or model conditions do not inappropriately affect the  desired results. And we apply our existing compliance, business ethics, and risk  management governance structures to our  ML development activities.   3. Privacy -By-Design.   We have implemented an enterprise -wide Privacy -By-Design  approach that incorporates privacy and data security into our ML model development  and data processing systems more generally. ADP provides information  about how we  handle personal data in privacy statements made available to our clients’ employees,  consumers, and job applicants.  Our ML models seek to minimize access to identifiable  information to ensure we use only the personal data we need to generate  insights. We  also maintain a robust security program for our ML models, including designing them in  line with our security standards and protecting them against misuse or compromise.

We strive to develop ML models that are explainable  and direct, with clear purposes. Our ML models are designed with understanding as a  key attribute, measured against an expressed desired outcome.  We test and evaluate  our ML models accordingly, adjusting as needed to maintain accuracy in l ine with the  models’ purposes.  We provide our clients with information about how our ML models  operate, their proper use, and their limitations, so that clients can implement those  models in accordance with their design and purpose, operate them effective ly, and use  their outputs as intended.   5. Data Quality.   Understanding how we use data, and the sources from which we obtain  it, is key to our ML model development. We maintain processes and systems to track  and manage our data usage and retention from across  ADP systems or processes. If we  use external information in our models, such as government reports or industry  terminologies, we understand the processes and impact of that information in our  models.  All data included in our ML models is monitored for it s quality and accuracy, as  well as for changes that could alter the desired outcomes.   6. Culture of Responsible AI.   We have an active AI & Data Ethics Committee, comprised of  both industry leaders and ADP experts across our business, which meets on a regular  cadence and reviews our design principles. The Committee advises on emerging  industry trends and concerns and provides guidance with respect to the principles ADP  should follow while developing products, systems and applications that involve AI and   data.   7. Inclusion and Training.   We are committed to having  diverse team s design and develop  our ML models, to ensure a wide variety of perspectives and experience are  considered.  After all, ML models impact humans, and human experience should inform   that impact.  In addition, we support skills development to accelerate the growth of a  diverse workforce that can develop and deploy the ML solutions of the future.
