5 FOREWORD FOREWORD Dear readers, Artificial­intelligence­(AI)­is­fundamentally­changing­society, ­ the economy, and everyday life. It is also creating great  opportunities for the way we live and work together. For  example, it helps doctors evaluate X-rays better and often more  accurately. It answers questions on insurance policies and other  products by means of chatbots. Also, in the foreseeable future,  it will enable cars to become more and more autonomous.  At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that these  applications need to be designed carefully so that we can make  use of the opportunities AI brings while still respecting our  social values and views. Artificial­intelligence­has­the­potential­to­extend­human­capabilities and help us make new discoveries. Making decisions  based on its results, which are automated or semi-automated  through machine learning, also sets fundamentally new challenges for us. In addition to questions of technical suitability,  general philosophical/ethical considerations come to the fore  as well as legal issues. The possibility that intelligent machines  will react “autonomously” casts new light on the individual  liability and responsibility of people and thus on the basis and  criteria of “attribution”. To ensure that humans are always  at the center of this development, we therefore need close  communication­about­artificial­intelligence­between­the­areas ­ of IT, philosophy, and law. In­view­of­the­fast­advance­of­artificial­intelligence­in­almost ­ every area of society, we have set the goal of developing  ­ certification­for­artificial­intelligence­in­interdisciplinary ­ exchange. This publication forms the beginning of this and  looks­at­current­challenges­for­artificial­intelligence­from ­ the viewpoint of IT, philosophy, and law. Building on this  interdisciplinary­exchange,­it­formulates­AI-specific­audit­areas ­ for­trustworthy­use­of­artificial­intelligence.  Fair behavior from the AI application towards everyone  involved, adaptation to the needs of users, comprehensible,  reliable, and safe functioning, as well as the protection of  sensitive­data­are­central­criteria­that­need­to­be­fulfilled­in­the ­ trustworthy use of an AI application. The audit areas presented here provide the basis for an AI audit  catalog that we are concurrently working on. Neutral inspectors will be able to check AI applications for trustworthiness  by using this catalog. With its many years of experience in the  development­of­secure­IT­standards,­Germany’s­Federal­Office ­ for Information Security (BSI) is an important partner in the  drafting­of­this­audit­catalog.­The­certification­system­will­allow ­ us to make a major contribution to setting quality standards  for­artificial­intelligence­that­is­“Made­in­Europe”,­ensuring ­ responsible use of technology, and promoting fair competition  among different suppliers.

6TRUSTWORTHY USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRELIMINARY REMARKS Executive summary This publication forms a basis for the interdisciplinary  development­of­a­certification­system­for­artificial­intelligence. ­ In­view­of­the­rapid­development­of­artificial­intelligence­with ­ disruptive and lasting consequences for the economy, society,  and everyday life, it highlights the resulting challenges that can  be tackled only through interdisciplinary dialog between IT,  law, philosophy, and ethics. As a result of this interdisciplinary  exchange,­it­also­defines­six­AI-specific­audit­areas­for­trustworthy­use­of­artificial­intelligence.­They­comprise­fairness, ­ transparency, autonomy and control, data protection as well  as security and reliability while addressing ethical and legal  requirements. The latter are further substantiated with the aim  of operationalizability. Structure of white paper The­interdisciplinary­approach­to­the­topic­is­reflected­in­the ­ chapter structure of this white paper. Chapter 1 provides an  introduction to the topic and advocates the necessity of certification­for­artificial­intelligence.­In­section­2.1,­fundamental ­ understanding of the functioning, possibilities, and limitations of the underlying technology is developed. The philosophical/ ethical view of the problem, in particular the role of the ethical  concepts of autonomy, freedom, and self-determination  of people, is examined in section 2.2. The basics of the  resulting legal requirements are discussed in section 2.3 with  particular focus on responsibility, traceability, and liability for  AI applications. Section 2.4 presents the effects of the different  interdisciplinary perspectives, in particular with regard to the  design­of­specific­AI­applications.­In­chapter­3,­the­specific ­ fundamental­audit­areas­are­then­justified­and­explained­in ­ separate sections from autonomy and control in section 3.1,  through fairness, transparency, reliability, and security, to data  protection in section 3.6. Finally, chapter 4 provides an outlook  on­the­next­steps­planned­in­the­development­of­a­certification ­ system. Context This­white­paper­is­the­first­fruit­of­an­interdisciplinary­project ­ carried out by the KI.NRW competence platform that is aimed  at­developing­a­certification­system­for­AI­applications.­This ­ system will check for responsible usage from an ethical/legal  perspective in addition to safeguarding the technical reliability.
7INTRODUCTION 1 INTRODUCTION 1 Notes from the AI frontier: Modeling the impact of AI on the world economy, Discussion Paper, McKinsey Global Institute, September 2018,   www.mckinsey.com/mgi 2 Gender-neutral pronouns have been used as far as possible.Each era brings its own challenges. We live in the age of  digitalization. New technology is changing the way we  live and work together on a massive scale. It is permeating  almost every area of society – whether it be the world of  work,­road­traffic,­the­healthcare­sector,­or­simply­the­way ­ we humans communicate with each other. Even if much of  it is taking place silently or in an insidious way, the speed  is  unprecedented when compared with previous societal  changes and would have caused fear and terror among our  ancestors at the time of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th  and 19th centuries. One central driving force behind digitalization is the rapid  development­of­artificial­intelligence­(AI)­that­was­triggered ­ by­breakthroughs­in­so-called­deep­artificial­neural­networks ­ on supercomputers. AI applications can even beat the top  human experts in specialist areas like image recognition and  complex­strategy­games.­Artificial­intelligence­creates­great ­ opportunities for new technical applications, digital business  models, and practical ways to make everyday life easier. Their  applications are spreading unstoppably to a wide range of  areas. Automated translation tools, voice control systems in  homes, and self-driving cars are just some examples you will be  familiar­with.­Artificial­intelligence­has­a­disruptive­potential: ­ the­scientific­and­economic­application­possibilities­are­so ­ far-reaching that it is currently hard to predict how our ways of  perception­and­action­will­be­changed­by­artificial­intelligence. ­ Furthermore, problem contexts will arise where we cannot  sufficiently­react­with­our­traditional­legal,­political,­ethical, ­ and social means. AI research improves the generalizability  of applications and their transferability to new contexts.  Artificial­intelligence­is­therefore­gradually­superseding­older ­  technology. Conventional value chains are being changed  disruptively. The increased productivity simultaneously relieves the burden  on humans as they have to perform less monotonous or heavy  work in certain areas.It is generally expected that the number of AI applications will  grow exponentially over the coming years. McKinsey predicts  that AI could deliver additional global economic activity of  around $13 trillion by 20301.  Furthermore,­it­is­expected­that­artificial­intelligence­will ­ contribute 1.2 percentage points to the annual growth of  the global gross domestic product. The impact is therefore  at least comparable with the productivity growth created by   previous industrial breakthroughs, such as the steam engine  (0.3 percentage points), industrial robots (0.4 percentage  points), and the spread of information technology (0.6  percentage points). This impressive growth is down to    more data being available and linkable, greater networking,  and increasingly higher processing speeds. This all enables  a greater degree of automation and individualization of  products and services. In this area, individualization is more  successful when more information is known about users2 and  customers. It is obvious that, within a short time, the use of AI   applications will have an impact on the way the whole of  society lives and works together. This is particularly evident   if we take surveillance systems as an example. For instance,  facial recognition has also been tested in pilot projects in  Germany such as at Berlin’s Südkreuz railroad station. Among  other things, however, the results were judged to be too  erroneous. On the one hand, this shows that the question of  reliability among AI applications sets new challenges compared with conventional software. On the other, however, it  is­now­just­a­question­of­time­and­money­before­sufficient ­ reliability can be achieved – at least in the aforementioned  case of facial recognition in surveillance systems. In principle,  AI-based intention recognition could also be combined  with facial recognition so that it may even be possible to  specifically­set­off­an­alarm­when­people­act­suspiciously­in ­ public places. The question immediately arises of how such  surveillance – even if functioning optimally –   would comply  with current laws, and whether or how the law would have 
8TRUSTWORTHY USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE   to be changed for this. This leads to new ethical questions,  since, on a societal level, we need to make fundamental  decisions on which AI applications shall be permitted. Law  and ethics need to cooperate in these new situations. The scenario illustrates that forecast economic growth can  only­be­achieved­in­the­long­run­if­sufficient­trust­is­placed ­ in AI technology. To create trust, AI applications need to  be designed in a way that allows us to check whether they  work safely and reliably. They also have to be in line with the  ethical and legal framework. For this purpose, in addition  to the technical safeguarding, we also need to clarify under  which conditions usage is ethically acceptable, and what  requirements result in particular from a legal aspect. The  associated challenges involve basic issues that can only be  resolved by an interdisciplinary team from IT, philosophy,  and­law.­Since­artificial­intelligence­is­entering­almost­all ­ spheres of society, the interests of numerous stakeholders are  affected and deserve legal protection. A legal framework may  need to be concretized or created for this purpose. Conversely we do not, however, want regulations to be  excessive­and­have­a­stifling­effect­on­innovation.­Likewise, ­ they should not become outdated too soon and thus  unusable due to the dynamics of technical progress. After all, ethics­is­not­fixed­for­good­which­is­why­there­is­always­the ­ possibility of ethical progress and regression due to social and  technological change. Development	of	certification	for	AI	applications Since AI applications often work with particularly large  quantities­of­data­and­use­highly­complex­models,­it­is­difficult­ in practice for users to check whether the assured features  are­being­fulfilled.­This­is­where­a­certification­system­for­ AI applications, which is based on professional and neutral  checks, can create trust and acceptance – both at companies  and among users and social stakeholders. In­view­of­the­challenges­posed­by­the­use­of­artificial­  intelligence, the KI.NRW competence platform has set the  goal­of­developing­a­certification­system­for­AI­applications,­ which can be employed by accredited inspectors.  In addition to assuring the technical reliability, the inspectors  also check for responsible usage from an ethical/legal  perspective.­The­certificate­should­confirm­a­quality­standard­ that enables providers to design AI applications in a way  that is lawful and ethically acceptable.

9INTRODUCTION In addition to the requirement that an AI application must  comply with ethical and legal principles, the interdisciplinary  team­identified­six­AI-specific­audit­areas­that­were­defined­in ­ such a way that they could be evaluated as far as possible by  individual specialists. The requirements of these audit areas are  derived from existing ethical, philosophical, and legal principles  (like for example, the general principle of equal treatment).  They cover the areas of fairness, transparency, autonomy  and control, data protection as well as security and reliability.  While security covers the normal aspects of secure operation   reliability concerns the special challenges set by checking  complex AI models, like deep neural networks. The question of how AI-applications can be used responsibly  and reliably has been debated intensively by international social  and­scientific­experts­for­a­while­now.­On­European­level,­the ­ European Commission has set up a High-Level Expert Group 3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai(HLEG)­for­artificial­intelligence.­In­April­2019,­the­HLEG­drew ­ up recommendations on which aspects should be taken into  consideration­during­the­development­and­use­of­artificial ­ intelligence3. This white paper picks up on these recommendations, differentiates them, and goes a step further in some  places. This is necessary because the recommendations from  the HLEG are primarily of general nature. So far, they do not  look­at­legal­aspects­(in­particular,­the­specifics­of­individual ­ national legal systems), nor at operationalizable ethical requirements­with­the­clear­aim­of­certification.­In­this­respect,­this ­ publication takes a horizontal as well as vertical approach in  comparison with the suggestions from the HLEG. In addition  to the philosophical ethics, it examines law and puts the two in  relation to one another. In order to meet the requirements of  operationalizability, the audit areas determined in this way are  also­described­more­specifically­and­in­greater­depth­than­the ­ HLEG categories.

Inspired by cybernetics, cognitive science and neuroscience, a wide range of technologies were developed. They  include intelligent agents that interact with the environment  or each other via sensors and actuators, the combination of  logic systems with heuristics, methods for symbolic knowledge  representation and evaluation as well as machine learning  (ML) with statistical processes and optimization, which  have recorded massive growth particularly following recent  developments. Soon after the discipline was created, people  critically debated its responsible usage4. Many AI technologies are based on the use of models that  contain­knowledge­about­and­experience­of­specific­tasks.­In­ machine learning, learning algorithms create the model from  many examples, known as training data. There are calculation  or “inference” processes for each kind of model that generate  an output for an input. This allows the model to be then  applied to new, potentially unknown data of the same type.  Machine learning lends itself whenever processes become  too­complicated­to­be­described­analytically,­but­sufficient­ example data (for example, sensor data, images or text) are  available. Using the learned models, we can make forecasts  or generate recommendations and decisions – without any  previously set rules or calculation methods.Deep neural networks represent an important and large class  of ML models. They consist of a large number of so-called  artificial­neurons­created­with­software,­which­are­linked­to­ each other by means of weighted connections. This kind of  network contains up to millions of open parameters that are  optimized for the training data. Structure of an AI application The function of an AI application5 is essentially determined by  the trained-in ML models with calculation methods and possibly  further pre- and post-processing procedures. This core in any  AI application is called “AI component” henceforth. The AI  component is always embedded in further software modules  for the AI application. The modules activate the AI component  and process their results further. They are ultimately responsible  for the “behavior” of the AI application that is visible on the  outside and for the interaction with the user. In particular, it is  their responsibility to detect and work around AI component  failure as well as react to faults and emergencies. An AI application can be stand-alone or form part of a system. For example,  pedestrian recognition can be integrated as an AI application  into an autonomous car, into a drone, or into a property  surveillance system. In the discussion on and assessment of an  AI­application,­one­first­important­step­consists­of­defining­the ­ limits of the AI application in the whole system and delimiting  the AI components in the AI application.
11TECHNOLOGICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND LEGAL PERSPECTIVES   Challenges in the use of ML models Dependency on training data   A­specific­request­to­an­AI­component­returns­the­input­for ­ the ML model from whose calculation result the AI component  generates an answer or reaction. Since AI applications “learn”  their “behavior” from generalization of example data, the  quality of the AI application greatly depends on the quality and  the properties of the data stock used. If the training data are  not statistically representative for the data that occur during  operation, the results may end up being “biased” in one direction. For this reason, we need regular checks during operation  to­see­how­well­the­data­distributions­fit­with­each­other­and ­ whether they diverge. Probabilistic character   Due to the statistical nature of the model and qualitative  uncertainties of input and learning data, the results are  approximate and tied to more or less uncertainty. Often there  is­effectively­not­even­a­definite­right­or­wrong­answer.­The­AI ­ component could output the best alternatives together with an  uncertainty indication. When interpreting such results, a person  needs to make a decision within their scope of discretion. In a  fully automated application, corresponding provisions need to  be made in the whole surrounding system to which humans  essentially belong. Comprehensibility and transparency of ML model and   its results   Many ML models are so-called “black boxes”. Black boxes are  systems in which only the external behavior can be observed.  The internal function mechanisms are not accessible, however,  due to complexity or a lack of knowledge. It is therefore often  impossible to understand how answers have come about.  For some applications, it may therefore be advisable to avoid  certain types of ML models. We can, however, also supplement  the ML model with another model, known as an “explanation  model”, that calculates which parts of the input were decisive  for a certain result. For example, it has been discovered that an  AI application in an image database recognized horses from a  water mark, i.e. an artifact in the images, instead of from the  shape of the animals.Testing of ML models   Classic software test methods fail because the models can no  longer­be­broken­down­into­separately­verifiable­units.­It­is ­ generally­not­even­possible­to­find­a­formula­to­characterize ­ reliable inputs. This was impressively demonstrated when an  automatic­traffic­sign­recognition­system­was­totally­confused ­ by­inconspicuous­stickers­affixed­to­the­signs.­Quantitative ­ testing of the model using separate test data, which should  have the same statistical distribution as training data, comes in  here instead of modular testing. Self-learning during operation   In principle, ML models can automatically carry on learning  during ongoing operation, for example, by making use of user  feedback. The ML model is then subject to constant change.  One known example is the Tay chatbot from Microsoft that  learned numerous racist phrases from its users within one day  and­was­eventually­shutdown.­Since­it­is­extremely­difficult­to ­ set  boundaries within which an AI component can continue to  learn, the controlled use of such AI applications still represents  an unsolved challenge at present. The currently best safeguard  in this case is continuous monitoring of the AI application   by humans. 2.2 Initial situation and questions from philosophy Philosophy, in particular its sub-discipline of ethics, has  now­been­assigned­the­task­of­providing­ethics­for­artificial ­ intelligence in order to counteract the disruptive potential of  this­technology.­“Ethics­of­artificial­intelligence”­refers­to­a ­ general requirement for how the application contexts (the  field­of­application­including­the­human/machine­interaction), ­ the technologies used, and the interfaces of the application  contexts to the rest of the social and digital sphere have to be  designed. The aim is for all participants to act well or be able  to behave well according to their respective moral convictions  and for nobody to be restricted in terms of rights, autonomy,  or­freedom.­The­certification­of­AI­applications­in­their­specific ­ application­contexts­is­an­important­first­step­towards­general ­ ethics for AI.
12 TRUSTWORTHY USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  Two­misunderstandings­need­to­be­avoided­here:­firstly,­ ethics­of­artificial­intelligence­refers,­in­this­case,­to­specific­AI­ applications for set tasks. This rules out questions like: which  moral obligations and what responsibility do we have towards  intelligent machines? Against this background, should we try  at­all­to­build­artificial­intelligence­with­general­intelligence?­ When can an AI application count as a moral agent and  does it possess freedom and rights? These questions do not  concern­the­certification­of­specific­AI­applications­which­are­ actually involved at present. Secondly,­ethics­for­artificial­intelligence­cannot­be­implemented as a code in which every question that arises produces a  binary­yes/no­answer­from­a­specific­problem­context.­The ­ question of “which moral system can be programmed or  modeled so that AI applications can be equipped in future?” is  misguided. The reason is neither ethics can be conclusively programmed since they are in principle subject to change, nor can  a consensus be reached on the correct moral system without  running­into­difficulties.­After­all,­ethics­come­from­historically ­ variable experiences gained by people. Societal transformations  like digitalization give rise to previously unknown ethical problems.­This­means­we­first­of­all­have­to­work­out­new­guidelines ­ by­researching­the­specific­human/machine­interaction.   These new guidelines have to be reconcilable with the universal  value system of the human life form (human rights as a framework for law and ethics). The main contribution of philosophy and ethics to the  ­ development­of­standards­for­artificial­intelligence­is­thus­ newly­defined­guidelines­for­the­use­of­our­currently­ existing AI technology. These guidelines need to be in line  with  fundamental ethical key principles like human dignity,  autonomy, and individual as well as democratic freedom.  They set out the framework within which AI applications  should move in their application context so that they do not  contradict ethical basic principles like fairness or transparency.  To this end, we have to look at both the AI application itself  and its interface to the social sphere. This will only succeed if  we place human AI users at the center. 2.3 Initial situation and questions from law In­terms­of­law,­numerous­challenges­arise­from­the­artificial­ intelligence technology that we have to face as a society. This  includes the question of to what extent machine learning  casts new light on the individual liability or the responsibility  of persons, and thus the reason and criteria for “imputation”.  Systems that are controlled by machine learned models can  have errors that could have a negative effect on individuals in  particular in the form of prejudices. In addition, there is the  difficulty­that­transparency­is­only­possible­to­a­limited­extent­ with regard to learning systems. Whether, and if applicable  in what scope, corresponding technologies are to be used in  sensitive­areas­of­society­therefore­requires­clarification. The healthcare sector is one example here. In this area,  artificial­intelligence­provides­support­for­doctors’­work,­ for example, in cancer diagnosis or in the form of so-called  “health apps”. In healthcare, more and more robots will be  used in future not least to replace human staff. As a result,  artificial­intelligence­technology­may­change­the­healthcare­ market considerably in the next decade. The legal profession  is­also­affected­as­is­shown­by­advances­in­the­field­of­“Legal­ Tech”. Therefore, not least German courtrooms are being  considered as another usage area for AI applications: an AI  application could be used in court to make forecasts about  the future risk posed by criminals. This system is already used  in parts of the USA to help make court probation decisions.  Furthermore,­the­use­of­digital­technology­in­the­fight­against­ crime seems to be less futuristic as it has already become reality for the German police. The term “predictive policing” refers  to the usage of data to predict criminal activity. This system  is used for police operations planning. “Predictive  policing”  is one application area that is earmarked for expansion in  the­“Artificial­Intelligence­Strategy­of­the­German­Federal­ Government”. The question of how we want to live in our society is at  the core of all of these developments. Is there a “human  image of digitalization” – and can this be reconciled with 
13TECHNOLOGICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND LEGAL PERSPECTIVES   a free state under the rule of law? People endowed with  human dignity are the focus here, for which Art. 1 Para.  1 of Germany’s Grundgesetz, the Basic Law, provides the  normative basis. According to the Grundgesetz, people may  not be degraded to mere objects of state actions (see for  example German Federal Constitutional Court decision   9,  89; 27, 1; 28, 386; 117, 71, 89; 131, 268, 286 subsequent  to G.

In  a free state under the rule of law, people are at the center of  philosophy, law, and technology. The cooperation of sciences  is therefore not only abstractly desirable, but is also an important requirement of our times. Design of the ethical/legal framework of artificial   intelligence   Our society and thus each individual has the possibility to  (help) decide how the world, in which we want to live with  artificial­intelligence­in­the­future,­should­look.­Philosophy,­ law, and technology play a central role in the discourse that  has to be conducted for this purpose. Technological development generates the problem areas of this social discourse. At the same time, it shows what is actually possible and what  belongs­to­the­realm­of­science­fiction.­Philosophy­reassigns­ central­terms­of­ethics,­such­as­the­moral­figure,­in­the­context­ of­artificial­intelligence­and­provides­reasoning­for­the­univer sal validity of certain ethical principles and legal norms like, for  example, human rights. The framework for a useful and pur poseful societal discourse is set only through this process. Law  uses ethical arguments in implementing the outcome of the  discourse­to­find­the­legally­correct­solution.­This­is­above­all­ relevant in areas where law still has not arrived on the scene.  In­view­of­the­large­number­of­changes­that­artificial­intelligence applications cause in each area of society, the question  arises from the lawyers’ viewpoint of whether there is a need  for regulation. Furthermore, basic legal terms are put to the  test when confronted with new technical developments. This  concerns, for example, the term for responsibility or “guilt”.  Basic terms from philosophical ethics like justness, equality,  autonomy, fairness, and transparency etc. are also affected by  this. These need to be conceived precisely for the context of AI  applications­as­these­terms­gain­a­specific­meaning­that­they­ only get through the new technology. These meanings can  only­be­clarified­in­trilateral­collaboration.­The­question­arises­ in­the­context­of­artificial­intelligence­as­to­whether­we­can­ keep the previous terms or whether they need modifying. In  this case, any legal evaluation requires clear understanding of  the technical contexts. Above all, this concerns the actual possibilities of AI applications and thus the question of effective  implementability of legal requirements. If these do not exist,  a situation occurs where something is demanded from the  legal side that cannot be achieved technically (for example,  unlimited transparency). If, however, a corresponding technical  feasibility does not exist, the further legal question arises of  whether both permissibility of the respective AI application  can­be­justified. Development of specific AI applications   In the design of AI applications within an existing ethical  and legal framework, it is essential to incorporate the  viewpoints of all three disciplines. As early as the design  phase­of­the­AI­application,­it­must­be­clarified­whether­the­
14 TRUSTWORTHY USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  application is ethically and legally permissible and, if so, what  boundaries­should­be­set­for­its­configuration.­One­necessary­ criterion in this case is to give all those involved the same  possibilities to make a moral decision, which they would  also have if AI was not used, and to observe their rights and  freedom. Many  other subsequent questions that result from  this – for  example, what fairness means in the context of the   application or what effects on the user, such as emotional  ties to the AI, are acceptable – cannot be answered from a  technological perspective alone, but instead require a holistic  approach again.If the general permissibility of the AI application has been  ensured, interdisciplinary questions also result for the  further development up to release, e.g. as Open Source.  These­questions­concern­handling­inevitable­conflicts­and­ trade-offs between the different audit areas. A different  balance  between the individual values is required in respective  different­contexts.­Conflicting­interests­can­be­brought­into­ a balanced relationship with each other through the ethical/ legal principle of proportionality. In this way, all perspectives  of the players involved are incorporated into the necessary  weighing of interests. Although weighing decisions cannot be  made on the meta level in individual cases, the proportionality  principle provides an instrument to establish the reliability of  specific­AI­applications.
15AUDIT AREAS FOR A CERTIFICATION SYSTEM   3 AUDIT AREAS FOR A CERTIFICATION SYSTEM  Due to their disruptive potential, it is particularly important  for AI applications to guarantee concurrence with the philosophical,­ethical,­and­legal­framework.­Their­certification­serves­ above all the protection of the fundamental legal and ethical  interests of people. We should be able to avoid impermissible  adverse effects on individuals or groups in this way. In this  ­ respect,­AI­certification­follows­the­general­purpose­of­ ­ averting­injustice­or­ethically­unjustified­conditions­in­society.  In addition to the rights to freedom of individuals and the  principle of equal treatment, this concerns in particular also  general social interests like, for instance, the protection and  preservation of the environment as well as the constitutional  democracy. A large number of substantiations can be derived from these  basic values and principles of a liberally organized community  taking the constitutional principle of proportionality into  consideration.­In­this­way,­audit­areas­that­are­significant­for­ certification­are­drawn­up­on­the­basis­of­ethics­and­law­as­ well as IT requirements.For the development of an AI application, this entails that  the application area, purpose, and scope as well as affected  persons­need­to­be­identified­at­an­early­stage.­All­players­ who are directly or indirectly affected should be involved   appropriately in this process. A risk analysis should be  performed that covers the possibilities of misuse and dual use  whose consequences need to be included appropriately in  the further development. Finally, the application should "by  design" be built in a way that it can be audited and tested to  the­defined­extent. 3.1 Autonomy and control Autonomy is recognized both as an ethical and legal value. In  terms of philosophy, autonomy forms the basis of all values  since, as a human community, we have to give ourselves  values. It is generally the capability for morally relevant  ­ self-determination.­This­justifies­the­freedom­of­individuals­to­ make autonomous decisions. This also covers all decisions that  relate to your own legal position and moreover the freedom  to determine the goals of your own actions as well as to  choose the means to reach these goals. Are the AI functions and the decisions made by the AI comprehensible?  Does the AI work reliably and is it robust? Is the AI protected against attacks, accidents, and errors? Does the AI protect privacy and other sensitive information?Is autonomous, effective usage of the AI possible? AUTONOMY AND CONTROL Does the AI treat all persons concerned fairly? FAIRNESSDoes the AI application respect social values and laws? ETHICS AND LAW TRANSPARENCY RELIABILITY SECURITY DATA PROTECTION
16 TRUSTWORTHY USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  AI applications are taking over more and more routine  activities and are increasingly autonomous. We need to  note that mobile systems (for example, robots and vehicles),  which are controlled by the assigned AI applications, are also  often described as “autonomous”. However, these systems  are only capable of choosing the means and not the actual  goal. In this context, we misleadingly say that the system  possesses “autonomy to act” where in fact this results from  the­human­goals.­For­this­reason,­an­area­of­conflict­with ­ autonomy (of people) also results as such AI applications can  influence­people­in­the­choice­of­their­goals­and­means.­The ­ latter is particularly the case if the AI application interacts  with human decision-making by, for example, generating  decision suggestions, creating control commands (and  possibly executing them), communicating with the people  directly (virtual assistants, chatbots,...), or being integrated  into work processes. Artificial­intelligence­may­not­disproportionally­restrict­the ­ autonomy of individuals and social groups. Against this  background, it is important in the development and operation of an AI application to state to what extent individual or  collective users can develop excessive trust in the AI application, build up emotional ties, or be impermissibly impaired  or directed in their decision making. The distribution of  tasks and interaction possibilities between the AI application  and user therefore need to be clearly and transparently  regulated. Users need to be familiarized with the possible  risks related to potential impairment of their autonomy,  and with their rights, obligations, and options to intervene  as well as make complaints. The user must be given the  possibility to control the system within an adequate scope.  Also, they must have the option of revoking their consent to  using an AI application. This should not simply be a yes/no  option for the user, but instead multiple usage possibilities  should be provided. In particular, it must also be possible  to switch off the application completely. Users need to be  supported adequately in the safeguarding of their autonomy  by receiving the necessary information about the behavior  of the AI application during operation without being  overwhelmed. The latter in particular also needs to cater for  people with special needs. In addition, appropriately secure  intervention possibilities need to be provided in case a risk to  the autonomy of the user is detected. 3.2 Fairness Emanating from the general principle of equal treatment,  safeguarding the principle of fairness is to be required  from an AI application both in an ethical and in a legal  respect. This refers to the ban on treating the same social  issues unequally or differing ones equally unless a different  procedure­would­be­objectively­justified.­The­principle ­ thus­stretches­to­the­ban­on­unjustified­discriminatory ­ treatment in an AI application and rules out impermissible  discrimination. This means in particular that individuals may  not be discriminated against again in the social result due to  their­affiliation­to­a­marginalized­or­discriminated­group.­For ­ example,­people­with­certain­surnames,­a­specific­religious ­ affiliation,­or­a­specific­gender­may­not­be­given­a­better­or ­ worse evaluation. Also, voice control systems must be able  to­react­to­people­with­specific­accents­or­sociolects­and­be ­ customizable. Furthermore, facial recognition software may  generally not make more frequent errors with people of a  certain skin color or other phenotypical features. AI applications learn from historical data. These data are  not necessarily free of prejudice. If, for example, the data  discriminate against women, the AI component can thus  adopt these prejudices, too. Also, certain groups may be  underrepresented in the data basis. We then talk of bias.  Bias can also lead to decisions that are unfair. One known  frightening­example­is­the­incorrect­classification­of­people ­ with dark skin as gorillas by Google Photos. Representative  training data must therefore be provided. Furthermore, an  improvement in the output of the ML model comes into  consideration as a suitable instrument for avoiding bias. To­operationalize­fairness,­a­quantifiable­fairness­term­needs ­ to be respectively developed from a technical viewpoint. The  groups that should not be discriminated against therefore  need­to­be­identified­in­a­first­step.­These­groups­can­be ­ social minorities, but also companies or general legal persons  as is the case, for example, with pricing on digital marketplaces.­In­a­second­step,­the­chosen­fairness­definition­needs ­ to­be­quantified.­The­differentiation­of­group­fairness­and ­ individual fairness should be highlighted in particular in this  process. Regarding group fairness, it should be required  that the results for all existing groups are comparable, for  example, in the sense of “hit probability” in all groups. In the 
17AUDIT AREAS FOR A CERTIFICATION SYSTEM   case of individual fairness, the same treatment of the same  individuals is set   as a standard.  3.3 Transparency The transparency of an AI application can be decisive for its  acceptance. Two aspects should be differentiated in this area.  Firstly, information on the correct usage of the AI application  needs to be available. Secondly, it is about requirements for  the interpretability, traceability, and reproducibility of results  that require insight into the internal processes of the AI  application. Information on usage of an AI application   First of all, it has to be generally clear in a communication  situation that the communication is occurring with an AI  application. Furthermore, the players need to be adequately  familiarized with the use of the application. This includes  understanding what purpose the application has, what it  does, what the potential risks are (also in terms of other  audit areas, for example, reliability, security, and fairness),  and who the target group of the application is. Traceability and interpretability of ML model   From­an­ethical/legal­viewpoint,­a­conflict­of­interests­can ­ occur between the desire for transparency for the user (or  for interested groups) on the one side and the safeguarding  of trade secrets or the general social safety on the other.  This­results­specifically­in­the­following­requirements­for­the ­ transparency of an AI application:   AI applications that affect the rights and interests of  third parties generally must be transparent. Transparency  means the traceability of how the AI application works.   AI applications do not need to be made transparent  to the outside. This does not apply if there are   predominantly social interests for the understandability   of the AI application.   AI applications that affect the rights and interests of third  parties may be non-transparent in exceptional cases if  this­is­proportionate­when­the­conflicting­interests­are­ weighed up.This second type of transparency concerns the internal   processes of the AI application and in particular of the  ML model. This involves the questions of interpretability,   traceability, and reproducibility of results for different  players and purposes. In particular, the following should be   demanded among other things:   Users must be able to comprehend the output of the  AI application to the extent that they provide informed  consent or refusal. This can frequently occur by showing  the passages relevant to the decision during input.   The information provided needs to be selected in a way  that users are not overwhelmed with irrelevant details to  allow informed intervention when using an    AI application.   Experts generally need to be able to trace the functioning  of the AI application on technical detail level, for  example, for the purpose of improvement or clarifying  conflicts.­The­experts­do­not­have­to­be­able­to­predict­ each output of an AI application. However, its general  behavior in principle needs to be explainable, traceable,  and documented during development and also later  in productive operation. Logging, documentation, or  archiving of the design, data, training, testing/validating  the model as well as the embedded environment are used  for this purpose. From a technical viewpoint, the question of general  ­ transparency­is­not­trivial­and­the­field­of­tension­between­ greater accuracy or robustness and the explicability of models  is a long-known dilemma in the world of AI. In many cases,  “black box” models are actually more accurate and more   robust than, for example, rule-based models, but they can  only be interpreted to a limited extent. This explicability can  partly also be achieved through subsequent processes, for  example, by training explanation models or analyzing the  input/output behavior of models (known as LIME analysis  – Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). The  interpretability­of­models­is­currently­an­active­research­field­ and great efforts are being made to understand the learning  processes of “black box” models better as well as to visualize  their internal processes and explain the resulting decisions.
18 TRUSTWORTHY USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  3.4 Reliability From a technical viewpoint, reliability represents a collective  term that partly compromises clearly different aspects of  the quality of an AI component: the correctness of the AI  outputs, the estimate of the ML model uncertainties, and the  robustness to harmful inputs (e.g. adversarial attacks), errors,  or unexpected situations. New kinds of error modes, which  are not typical for humans and thus unexpected, can lead  to situations that are potentially critical because they have  not been practiced – in particular in direct human/machine  interaction. In-depth knowledge of the application is required to evaluate  these­reliability­dimensions­for­a­specific­AI­application­and­ to­define­under­what­requirements­the­application­can­be­ classified­as­reliable­according­to­these­dimensions.­For­this­ classification,­the­requirements­that­have­already­been­collected, the initial risk assessment as well as the ethical and legal  framework should be fully taken into consideration. The conversion of the requirements into quantitative measurements  and target values requires knowledge of the domain as well  as mathematical/technical expertise and is never complete by  nature. The same applies to the description of the application  area­of­the­AI­application.­It­should­be­specified­as­precisely­as­ possible and be formalized in order to ensure that the training  and­test­data­used­sufficiently­cover­the­inputs­to­be­expected­ during use of the AI application. In any case, the reliability of  the­AI­application­should­be­configured­for­the­capabilities­of­ the people using it. Correct implementation of the training routines and of the  finished­trained­model­is­an­essential­factor­in­meeting­these­ requirements. The tests to be performed for this should be  established­in­the­area­of­machine­learning­and­be­configured­ for the respective application. If ML model weaknesses are  uncovered, we need to react to this with suitable correction  mechanisms right up to use of a back-up plan. The reliability  of the AI application should be guaranteed at all times in  productive operation in this case.  This implies that the correct function needs to be checked  at appropriate regular intervals. In order to also increase the  reliability gradually, suitable measures should be established,  for example, by saving challenging scenarios in productive use.3.5 Security Security in the sense of protection against attacks and safety  in the sense of protection against dangers arising from the AI  application are at least just as highly important as with other  information and technical systems. The security and safety  concepts can be used on the whole AI application in which  the AI component is embedded and on the AI component  itself.­AI-specific­risks­should­be­intercepted­or­handled­in­a­ suitable way. These risks can come in the form of function  failure or major function changes in the AI component as well  as unauthorized information leaks. The causes of the function  failure, for example, adversarial attacks, and major function  changes are already reacted to inside the AI component,  which comes under the reliability audit area. If this is not  possible to the full extent, the measures of the surrounding  AI application are effective and the responsibility lies with the  security audit area. The­HLEG­has­defined­abstract­security­goals­for­AI­applications. These abstract goals (and those going further) are,  however, far off being put into operation for instance through  an audit catalog or a standard. Conversely, a whole series  of­operatively­verifiable­specifications­and­standards­do­exist­ particularly in the area of security. However, they do not refer  specifically­to­the­special­features­of­AI­applications.­The­aim­ of the security audit area is to gather the requirements from  existing standards that are indispensable for protection against  attacks and the dangers of AI applications and supplement  them­with­further­specific­AI­requirements. 3.6 Data protection AI applications are suitable for intervening in a large number  of­legal­positions.­Quite­frequently,­this­involves­interference­ in the private sphere or the right to informational self-deter mination. For example, AI applications often process sensitive  information, for example, trade secrets, private information,  or personal data, such as voice recordings, photos and  videos. Therefore, we need to ensure that the relevant data   protection-law regulations, for instance, the General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Germany’s Federal Data  Protection Act are observed. AI applications may not just  pose a risk to the private sphere of individuals. Furthermore,  they could affect (trade) secrets that do not contain personal  data­as­defined­by­the­GDPR,­but­require­protecting­in­terms­ of ethics and law. This can involve, for example, machine  data that contains information on the process utilization 
19AUDIT AREAS FOR A CERTIFICATION SYSTEM   or error rates regardless of which person was active as the  machine­operator.­The­AI­certification­should­ensure­that­ data  protection risks and measures in the AI application are  ­ analyzed­and­documented­sufficiently­by­the­AI­system­so­ that­the­data­protection­officer,­who­generally­has­to­be­  nominated, receives useful support. This will enable them  to­conduct­the­investigation­and­make­the­final­decision­or­ approve the data protection while taking the special data  protection­challenges­related­to­artificial­intelligence­into­ consideration. The challenges for data protection are potentially greater than  in traditional IT systems since AI applications often gather  together data that were previously not linked. Also, new  methods of linking data are not formed until machine learning  is employed. The more data are linked, the greater the risk  that­people­or,­for­example,­specific­business­premises­can­be­ identified­even­without­direct­specification­of­corresponding­ attributes. For example, it is possible, with approximately 95  percent reliability, to re-identify persons from the way they use  a computer keyboard. If there were a public (or commercially  available) database that assigned keyboard typing patterns to  persons, the typing  sample would become a so-called “quasi-identifier”­that­­ enables­a­link­to­a­person­to­be­established.­ Also, AI methods can potentially create references to persons during the processing of text, speech, and image data as well  as logged usage data. In addition, there is a risk that a trained  model re-allows references to a person without actually  containing personal data. This results in the gathered information having to be   effectively protected both during training and also during  operation. AI applications may access personal data only with  the consent of the owner. Further processing and disclosure  to third parties may – subject to further restrictions – occur  exclusively with consent from the owner of the legally protected right. It must be ensured that there are no gaps in the  protection that enable unauthorized access. Individuals must  be granted the option of deleting their data. The necessary  measures thus include notifying the person concerned about  the purpose and use of personal data or data derived from  them and providing adequate consent, inquiry, objection,  and revocation mechanisms related to the use of personal  data. Compliance with the principles of data economy and  use­for­a­specific­purpose­should­be­indicated­as­well.­A­risk­ analysis should also be performed to examine the potential to  produce a reference to a person. This analysis should check  any measures taken to make data anonymous or to aggregate  data­against­the­potential­for­re-identification­via­links­to­ background knowledge.
20 TRUSTWORTHY USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  4 OUTLOOK This­white­paper­is­the­first­fruit­of­an­interdisciplinary­project­ carried out by the KI.NRW competence platform that is aimed  at­developing­a­certification­system­for­AI­applications.­This­ system will check for responsible usage from an ethical/legal  perspective in addition to safeguarding the technical reliability.  An AI audit catalog, which is currently being developed and  will allow accredited inspectors to assess AI applications in  a professional and neutral manner, will form the basis for  certification. The plan is to publish an initial version of the audit catalog at  the­beginning­of­2020­and­then­begin­with­the­certification­of ­ AI­applications.­Due­to­the­complex­nature­of­the­topic,­the­first ­ version will set suitable restrictions related to the applicability in  several places, for example, in the area of further learning during  operation or for the control of critical security applications.  A  series of different AI applications is used during the development  of the audit catalog to check the integrity and universality of  the audit objectives and requirements. We will also evaluate and  demonstrate the use of the catalog as part of this.One special task in this area will be checking the audit objectives against existing standards and the differentiation from  existing audit catalogs and laws, for example, for IT security  and the General Data Protection Regulation. For this reason,  the project team is collaborating with Germany’s Federal  Office­for­Information­Security­(BSI)­to­incorporate­their­many­ years of experience in the area of IT security for the drafting  and recognition of IT testing standards. The­methods­and­possible­applications­of­artificial­intelligence­ are being continuously developed on a massive scale. We can  assume that society’s concept of ethics and the regulation  of­artificial­intelligence­will­be­shaped­with­them.­Therefore,­ the audit catalog must be a living document that undergoes  continuous updating from the areas of information technology, law, and philosophy. At the same time, the scope of the  catalog will be expanded step by step, and special catalogs  will be produced for certain application areas and risk classes.
