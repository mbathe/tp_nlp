    11352/18    MS/gb  2  ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN    ANNEX   The EU Communication on Artificial Intelligence   Europe has strong assets in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the potential to boost its competitiveness  with a rapid adoption of these technologies. However, other regions of the world are investing massively, with the risk of Europe lagging behind. In this context, the European Commission adopted in April 2018 a Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe 1. The communication  was also accompanied by a Commission Staff Working Document on liability2. In parallel, the  Commissio n proposed legislation to open up more public sector data for re -use, and other measures  to make data sharing easier3.  The proposed AI strategy for Europe aims at strengthening European AI capacity on the basis of three pillars:   − boosting the EU's technological and industrial capacity and AI uptake across the economy;   − preparing for socioeconomic changes,  − ensuring an appropriate ethical and legal framework.   It puts forward that Member States and the European Commission join forces  and work together  towards a coordinated plan on Artificial Intelligence by the end of 2018. The goal is to maximise the impact of investments at EU and national levels, encourage synergies and cooperation across the EU, including on ethics, exchange best practices, and collectively define the way forward to ensure that the EU as a whole can compete globally.                                                     1  European Commission , Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe (25.4.2018).  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/communication- artificial -intelligenceeurope    2  Doc. 8507/18 ADD 1, SWD(2018) 137 final   3  European Commission, Communication "Towards a common European data space"  (25.4.2018) https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/communication- towards common -european- data-space  
    11352/18    MS/gb  3  ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      Artificial Intelligence in the next multiannual financial framework   For the next multi- annual financial framework, the European Commission adopted proposals of  complementary programmes to ensure R&I leadership and broad roll -out of Artificial Intelligence,  with different instruments and targets:   • The Single Market Programm e supports among other goals the "a doption of new  technologies to efficiently tackle internal market challenges (e.g. block -chain, Artificial  Intelligence, Mixed reality, Big Data Analytics) and ensuring that such technological  progress benefits the internal market".   • The Digital Europe Programme4, the first pan -European programme dedicated to the  digital transformation . Endowed with a proposed total budget  of €9.2 billion, it will  reinforce Europe's capacities in key digital technologies.     With €2.5 billion for Artificial Intelligence, it will notably support building up and strengthening core AI capacities in Europe, including data resources, repositories of algorithms and testing and experimentation sites.  Moreover, the Commission proposes to reinforce the role  of Digital Innovation Hubs and their networking as an instrument to deliver on the digital transformation of the economy and society.    In addition to Artificial Intelligence, the Digital Europe Prog ramme will cover high  performance computing, cybersecurity, advanced digital skills and interoperable solutions in areas of public interest.                                                     4  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/connecting -europe -facility -digital- europe -andspace- programmes_en   
    11352/18    MS/gb  4  ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN        • The Horizon Europe Programme5 will mobilise research, technological development,  demonstration, piloting, proof -of-concept and innovation on key digital technologies,  including AI. It builds on Europe's leadership in Research and Innovation in digital technologies and complements the Digital Europe Programme 6.  • The InvestEU Fund7 will provide access to finance with its four policy areas –  sustainable infrastructure; research, innovation and digitisation; small and medium sized businesses; and social investment and skills. InvestEU covers a broad range of activities and financial instruments such as loans, equity  financing and guarantees,  which can be used to finance the adoption of digital innovations by companies willing to digitally transform.   Joining forces at EU level   A thorough discussion between the Commission and Member States is needed to determine how national efforts could best be aligned and coordinated in order to ensure the necessary scale, speed and impact pertaining to AI -driven innovation in Europe.                                                     5  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/research -and-innovation -including- horizoneurope -iter-and-euratom -legal -texts -and-factsheets_en    6  Proposal  on establishing the specific programme implementing Horizon Europe – the  Framework Programme for Research and Innovation states that "the completion of the Digital Single Market and the growing opportun ities from the convergence of digital and  physical technologies requires a stepping up of investments. Horizon Europe will contribute  to these efforts with a substantial increase of spending in main digital research and  innovation activities compared to th e Research and Innovation Framework Programme  Horizon 2020. This should ensure that Europe remains at the forefront of global research and innovation in the digital field." EUR 13 billion are spent in main digital activities under Horizon Europe.   7  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/investeu- programme_en   
    11352/18    MS/gb  5  ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      The AI strategy for Europe foresees the launch of a coordinated plan on Artificial Intelligence  with  Member States and a series of high -level meetings by the Member States’ Group on Digitising  European Industry (DEI) and AI to develop such a plan. Moreover, a close dialogue with the  Council is planned to be established mainly via close cooperation be tween the Member States’  Group on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI  and the High- Level Working Group of  Competitiveness and Growth, as well as related Council meetings (roadmap of AI -related events in  Annex).  First discussions in the context of the  implementation of the EU's AI Strategy have already taken  place as part of the existing Member States’ Group on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI    on 18 June 2018. This meeting, attended by more than 60 national representatives from all EU28,  launched work on a coordinated plan, and identified preliminary shared priority areas.   Building on the various strands of work, the following priorities emerged:   1) AI applications need to be championed by all, in academia, industry, services and the public administrations.    A coordinated plan should target key sectors such as health care, finance, agriculture, advanced manufacturing, automated driving and fighting climate change. The use of health data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will play a key role to improve predictive medicine to the benefits of European citizens. In the manufacturing sector, there is also a whole ecosystem to be developed to smarten the vast installed base of machine tools with sensors and AI.  
    11352/18    MS/gb  6  ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      2) Shi ft in Public Sector services   In order to reap the benefits and truly develop AI -based economy, we need our public sectors to  change the way they service citizens. AI can enable the creation of real -world users of public  services. However, in order to ensur e that, we first need to know that the public sector leads by  example. Servicing the citizens needs not only to become digital but also AI enabled whenever  feasible. The use of AI in the public sector encourages the introduction of new technologies in the private sector. Additionally, our legal system should enhance and not restrict innovation. The flexibility of the public sector and regulations is important, as the full potential of the evolving technologies is not clear at the beginning.  Therewith, we must find ways to develop practical applications, whereas low -hanging fruits from  public sector can be  a quick example. Public sector can direct innovation through public  procurement and by designing public sector processes, so that those processes where te chnology  makes the work of a person can be done by AI. These processes can be for example in the areas of data sourcing, control of compliance with conditions, frequent communication with citizens.   Furthermore, sharing practical solutions and experiences between the Member States, and policy development experiences and solutions of using AI in the private sector, are essential. We should support and stimulate public and private pilot projects for the development of AI, and it is important to define priorit y pilot projects from the European Union.  3) The development and broad roll -out of AI requires excellence in research and world -class  innovation infrastructures, such as the Digital Innovation Hubs.   Investing in research and innovation along a coordinated agenda and together with schemes  allowing for disruptive innovations will be essential for the future of Europe. New ways of  collaboration will be needed to test and experiment AI in new applications and to build up an investor community that triggers hig her private investment into this technology. The European  Commission announced to maintain and even increase the investments in Artificial Intelligence in the future Horizon Europe Programme. (see above)  
    11352/18    MS/gb  7  ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      Broad roll -out requires availability of testbeds, not only for AI, but also for digital technologies  which enable its deployment  such as High Performance Computing (HPC), 5G, cybersecurity and  data platforms, which will be particularly important to pool data from various sources and handle access and use rights.   It is also critical to make AI available to SMEs, to allow them to reap the potential benefits this technology can bring. Member States supported the critical role played by Digital Innovation Hubs in the delivery of the digital transformation of the economy, by approaching and supporting SMEs in their digital transformation.   Pilot financing schemes under the current financial framework in preparation to the InvestEU Fund could be explored. These schemes could form a pipeline of projects for an investment platform for the digital transformation of the economy, notably in the further development and adoption of Artificial Intelligence by SMEs.   4) Changing work environment, education, training and up- skilling remains a challenge.    Developing, training, keeping and attracting the best digital talents worldwide are key for a sustained growth of the European economy. Training should not cover only specialists but also all the workforce so that they can seize the digital opportunities and particularly AI a s outlined in the  Digital Europe Programme.   The European Commission also set up a high- level expert group on the impact of the digital  transformation on EU labour markets 8 to analyse, advise and explore policy options.   5) Free movement of data as an enabl er of new technologies and AI   Most future successful business -models are likely to be data- driven. The widespread adoption of AI  will further deepen this approach, as it is, in fact, the explosion of data, that will enable AI to advance. At this point, the  principle of free movement of data is becoming of utmost importance.                                                     8  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/call -expression -interest -high- level -groupimpact -digital- transformation -eu-labour -markets  
    11352/18    MS/gb  8  ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      To be more specific, the real use of AI requires the availability, sharing, reciprocal cross- usage of  data. In cooperation, we need to further develop the free movement of data, which would allow AI  to be developed across borders. Furthermore, in this context, we should consider the possibilities of pooling data sources.   6) Adequate ethical and regulatory frameworks are a precondition to roll -out AI which  embeds and respects European v alues .   The recently launched High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLG) 9  and its  outreach to a broad range of stakeholders through the European AI Alliance10 will build and echo  the ongoing development of ethical standards in several countries. At this point, Member States are not adopting new regulations, but are focusing on national strategies in order to see where AI should be placed in the national legal order in the first place. Member States are rather interpreting existing legislation in the light of AI and adopting norms and guidelines for businesses. For example, Estonia has allowed testing of autonomous vehicles on the roads  under the existing road regulations. It is however key that companies further experiment with digital technologies, and for  that Member States may need to verify that existing regulations do provide the required legal certainty for them. Thus, numerous Member States are currently in the process of drafting national strategies on AI, or have already done so. It is clear that in order to benefit from new technologies, we have to make the legal environment fit for them. Furthermore, it is clear that in order to ensure highest level of  consumer protection, we need to introduce some new principles regarding liability,  consent, transparency, ethics, etc.. It would be worthwhile to explore how regulatory sandboxes could provide the required legal certainty within the current regulatory fra meworks.                                                     9  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/high -level -group -artificial -intelligenceA    10  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/european -ai-alliance   
    11352/18    MS/gb  9  ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      The European Commission appointed an expert group on liability and new technologies which will  examine whether existing EU legislation in the area of product liability is suitable for new technologies such as AI, advanced robotics, and the Inte rnet of Things (IoT). It will also assist in  developing principles that could serve as guidelines for adapting applicable EU and national laws to new technologies. By mid- 2019 the Commission will issue guidance on the interpretation of the  Product Liability Directive in the light of technological developments, to ensure legal clarity for consumers and producers in case of defective products.   Questions for the discussion   • What should be the areas for shared priorities and collaboration to agree on for a coordinated plan on AI?   • What role could the ongoing and future EU programmes and national initiatives play to  boost private and public investments and diffuse the benefits of digitalisation to all  businesses and administration in the EU?   • Specifically, what  are Member States doing to establish AI -focussed Digital Innovation  Hubs?    
    11352/18    MS/gb  10  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN    Annex  to ANNEX   Work strands on Artificial Intelligence  Introduction  Last year, the Tallinn Digital summit, organized by the Estonian Presidency, brought together EU  heads of state or government to debate plans for digital innovation enabling Europe to stay ahead of the technological curve and be a digital lead in the global world in the years to come. It sent a clear message on the need for a stronger and more coherent Digital Europe.  In the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 19 October 2017 Member States then agreed  that, to build a Digital Europe, a series of a priorities ne eded to be addressed, out of which the rise  of artificial intelligence. The importance to have a bold approach to artificial intelligence was confirmed with the signature of a declaration of cooperation signed on 10 April.   Further to the request of the Eur opean Council, the Commission proposed a European approach to  artificial intelligence in a communication published on 25 April 2018. The distinguishing trait of the proposed European strategy is an integrative effort, tackling competitiveness, ethical, leg al and  socio -economic issues together.   Europe has world- class researchers, laboratories and start -ups in the field of AI. The EU is also  strong in robotics and has world- leading transport, healthcare, energy and manufacturing sectors  that should adopt AI t o remain competitive. However, fierce international competition requires  coordinated action for the EU to be at the forefront of AI development. In order to avoid fragmentation and ensure sufficient scale, the Commission initiated a cooperation at EU -level   through the Digitising European Industry platform, wi th the objective to develop a coordinated plan  on AI with Member States.  
    11352/18    MS/gb  11  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      In the next multi- annual financial framework investments in AI -related research and innovation are  expected to continue through Horizon Europe. The Commission also proposes a new Digital Europe  Programme to build up and strengthen core AI capacities in Europe, including data resources and repositories of algorithms. The Digital Europe Programme will reinforce and network digital innovation hubs in the Member States with a focus on testing and experimentation. This will be  complemented by investments in High Performance Computing, Cybersecurity, digital capacities, interoperability and skills.   I.  Implementation of the EU strategy p roposed by the Commission   1. Context   The European Council of 19 October 2017 11 pointed out a sense of urgency to address emerging  trends including artificial intelligence and invited the Commission to put forward a European approach to artificial intelligence by early 2018. It  called on the Commission to take the necessary initiatives for strengthening the framework conditions with a view to enable the EU to explore new markets through risk -based radical innovations and to reaffirm the leading role of its industry.   The conclusions of the COMPET Council 12 on 12 March 2018 stressed tha t, in order to operate in a  data economy, companies need a continued focus on the innovative development and take -up of key  forward looking trends including Artificial Intelligence. The Council called for strengthening efforts and the rapid implementation of policy priorities in respect of the digitalization of industry with a special emphasis on reinforcing initiatives like Digital Innovation Hubs and other initiatives under the European platform on digitising industry supporting small and medium -sized ent erprises  (SMEs) in their digital transformation.                                                     11  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/21620/19- euco -final-conclusions -en.pdf    12  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/pr ess/press -releases/2018/03/12/eu- industrial -policystrategy -council -adopts -conclusions/   
    11352/18    MS/gb  12  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      In response to the call from the European Council, on 25 April, the European Commission adopted  a Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe13. The European strategy is based on a  holistic approach , tackling research and industrial deployment, ethical, legal and socio- economic  issues. It was accompanied by a Commission Staff Working Document on liability14. In parallel, the  Commission proposed legislation on data, to open up more public sector data f or re-use, and other  measures to make data sharing easier15.  The proposed AI strategy for Europe aims at strengthening European AI capacity on the basis of three pillars:   − boosting the EU's technological and industrial capacity and AI uptake across the econ omy,   − preparing for socioeconomic changes,  − ensuring an appropriate ethical and legal framework.  The European approach on AI proposes that the Commission and the Member States join forces and work together towards a coordinated plan on Artificial Intelligence by the end of 2018. The goal is  to maximise the impact of investments at EU and national levels, encourage synergies and cooperation across the EU, including on ethics, exchange best practices, and collectively define the way forward to ensure  that the EU as a whole can compete globally. Discussions will take place as  part of the existing Member States’ Group on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI. The first meeting took place on 18 June 2018.                                                    13  European Commission , Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe (25.4.2018).  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/communication- artificial -intelligence europe    14  Doc. 8507/18 ADD 1, SWD(2018) 137 final   15  European Commission, Communication "Towards a common European data space"  (25.4.2018) https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/communication -towards common -european- data-space  
    11352/18    MS/gb  13  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      The European Council on 28- 29 June 2018 highlighted that in order to build a European data  economy, further action is needed to improve the efficient use of data across the EU, reiterating that  high- quality data are essential for the development of Artificial Intelligence. It invited the co legisla tors to swiftly examine the latest data package and asked the Commission to work with  Member States on a coordinated plan on Artificial Intelligence, building on its recent communication.  2. Member States' Group on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI    On 18 June, the national Directors -General of the Member States’ Group on Digitising European  Industry (DEI) and AI 16 firstly met with representatives from the 28 Member States, Norway and  Switzerland responsible for fostering artificial intelligence (AI).   The meeting proved Member States' full commitment  to make Artificial Intelligence a success for  Europe. EU Member States are adopting new strategies for strengthening the efficient use of AI in  line with the Declaration of Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence signed by 28 Member States and Norway. The launch of national strategies with significant investments 17 is a strong sign that  Europe is willing to lead the development of AI for businesses and citizens.  In her discussion with Member State representati ves, Commissioner Gabriel  stated her ambitions of  a timely coordinated plan, with concrete actions which meet the needs of the European economy  and society.   Work on the coordinated plan on AI will continue with working meetings of Sherpas nominated by the members of this Group, as well as with two additional meetings of the Member States’ Group  on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI.                                                     16 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/high- level -governance -meeting digitising -european -industry -forum -focus -artificial -intelligence    17  France will dedicate €1.5 billion for take -up of AI by SMEs, Finland committed €160  million for AI platforms, Sweden presented a 10 -year plan and several hundred millions to  build academic and industrial competences; and the UK announced an AI sector deal of €1  billion covering investments from technology to skills. And these are just a few examples, as most o ther countries are also making progress on their own AI initiative.  
    11352/18    MS/gb  14  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      The coordinated plan on AI will develop along the three pillars of the Communication. In order to  integrate the deve lopment of the expert groups, joint meetings are also planned.  3. High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLG)   Pursuant to a call for experts launched on 9 March 2018, the Commission has set up a High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligen ce ("AI HLG") to support the implementation of the strategy  on AI. Almost 500 applications were received, and 52 experts have been selected to carry out the AI HLG's mandate.   The experts will focus on two main deliverables:   (1) (draft) AI ethics guidelines , which will offer guidance on how to implement ethical  principles when developing and deploying AI, building on the work of the  European  Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies  and the  European Union Agency for  Fundamental Rights ; and   (2) mid- and long -term policy recommendations on AI -related challenges and  opportunities (the so -called AI policy and investment recommendations) , which  will feed into the policy development process, the legislative evaluation process and the development of a next -generation digital industrial strategy.   The first meeting of the AI HLG took place on 27 June. Further targeted workshops will be organised between September 2018 and January 2019.   The outcomes of these workshops will feed into the AI ethics guidelines and into the policy policy  and investment recommendations report.  
    11352/18    MS/gb  15  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      The next two meetings of the AI HLG are planned on 8- 9 October in Helsinki and on 22 January  2019 i n Brussels. These will be (partially) joint meetings with the Member States’ Group on  Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI, in order to ensure close cooperation between both. The  AI HLG will use the input received from the MS in its deliverables. Ultimately, the success of the AI HLG's work depends on the input and support granted by Member States to this initiative.   4. European AI Alliance   The AI HLG serves as the steering group of the European AI Alliance, a broad multi -stakeholder  forum aiming to stim ulate reflection on AI's challenges and opportunities by all concerned and  interested parties. With the establishment of the Alliance, the Commission aims to mobilise a diverse set of participants, including businesses, consumer organisations, trade unions , and other  representatives of civil society bodies in order to share best practices and encourage private investment  and activities related to the development of AI. The European AI Alliance is hosted on an online platform which was launched mid- June, and which now already counts more than 1000  members.   5. Expert group on liability and new technologies   As announced in the AI Communication and in the Staff Working Document on "liability for emerging digital technologies" of 25 April, the European Commission has appointed in June an expert group on liability and new technologies  which will examine whether existing EU  legislation in the area of product liability is suitable for new technologies such as AI, advanced robotics, and the IoT (Internet of Things). The call for expression of interest can be found here:  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/call -experts -group- liability -and-newtechnologies .  
    11352/18    MS/gb  16  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      It will also assist the Commission in developing principles that could serve as guidelines for  adapting applicable EU and national laws to new technologies. The expert group has two formations: a Product Liability Directive (PLD) formation and a New Technologies (NT)   formation.   The PLD formation has a tota l of 45 experts (including MS representatives, stakeholders and legal  experts) 18. Its first meeting took place on 8 June. The PLD formation will assist the European  Commission with expertise on the applicability of the Product Liability Directive to traditional  products, new technologies and new societal challenges. It will help produce interpretative guidance for the PLD and possibly also recommendations for a revision / recast of the PLD. The timing for the interpretative guidance is June 2019.   The NT form ation has a total of 16 experts composed of law professors. It will assist the European  Commission in developing principles that can serve as guidelines for possible adaptations of applicable laws at EU and national levels relating to new technologies. The  first meeting of the NT  formation took place on 26- 27 June. This formation should produce a report by mid- 2019 ( to be  confirmed ).    6. High -level expert group on the impact of the digital transformation on EU labour  markets and the future of work   A high- level expert group on the impact of the digital transformation on EU labour markets  and the  future of w ork is being set up by the European Commission (but not yet established), to analyse and  advise the Commission on the impact of the digital transformation on EU labour markets and explore policy options. This expert group is composed of nine persons acting in a personal capacity,  under the chairmanship of Professor  Goos. A first meeting is planned in September 2018. The  group is expected to produce a report, with policy recommendations, by March 2019. Five meetings of the HLEG -FoW expert group have been pla nned at regular intervals.                                                     18  http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm? do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID =3592&NewSearch=1&NewSearch=1

International dimension of AI   International cooperation on AI should be implemented on the basis of the strategy defined in the  AI Communication. It should look in particular at protecting EU's interests but also ensuring that cooperation is established with international partners that are like -minded countries sharing EU's  fundamental values, such as the respect for human dignity, pluralism, non -discrimination an d  protection of privacy. The EU AI Alliance should be the main vehicle to associate other non- EU  countries especially when it comes to the AI ethics guidelines.    In terms of future activities, at bilateral level, a Co mmission -Japan Ministerial meeting on AI is  considered and could take place in April  2019 in Japan with the objective to deepen mutual  understanding on EU and Japan AI initiatives and in particular to converge on AI ethics principles. Possible outcomes would feed into the G7 and G20 discussio ns. At multilateral level, a G7 multistakeholders conference on AI will take place in Montreal (Canada) early December 2018. This one-day event will build upon the objectives outlined in the G7 Innovation Ministers’ Statement on  AI and the Charlevoix Comm on Vision for the Future of Artificial Intelligence, bringing together  industry, research institutions and civil society stakeholders with a focus on how we can enable environments that foster societal trust, maximize growth, and realize inclusive developm ent. A G20  Digital Economy/Trade Ministers' meeting will be organised on 8 and 9 June  2019 in Tsukuba (Japan). Japan did not provide yet information on areas that will be covered but it is expected that AI and digital trade will be on the agenda.  
    11352/18    MS/gb  18  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      II. C ompetitiveness Council AI- related work tracks   1. General overview   The Austrian Presidency has presented its priorities19. The Competitiveness Council will operate  under the umbrella of the Presidency goal of "Securing prosperity and competitiveness through  digitalisation". The roadmap of the Presidency Council meetings will therefore pursue boosting  industrial competitivene ss for the EU as a whole, leveraging opportunities that come with  digitalisation. This includes the promotion of innovation, such as with respect to Digitising  European Industry, through Research and Innovation investments and demand side measures, which  overall improve Europe's competitive position internationally. A new, holistic and strong  European Industrial Policy Strategy  shall take full advantage of current and future developments  such as digital transformation, the potential of AI and the need for s killed labour. The Presidency  aims to deliver input related to two key elements – besides the issue of the necessity of skills:   Artificial Intelligence and Robotics: Artificial Intelligence is a topic of high importance for the  competitiveness of the European economy. It will be crucial to highlight the benefit of Artificial  Intelligence and Robotics for the industrial sector. By pooling our resources and working closely together, we will be able to seize the competitive advantage of AI for a reindustrialis ation of  Europe. This topic will be discussed from different angles during the Informal COMPET Council, the HLG CompCro in September and the COMPET Council in September.                                                     19  https://www.eu2018.at/agenda -priorities/programme.html   
    11352/18    MS/gb  19  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      Council Conclusions on “Future EU Industrial Policy Strategy” and Presidency Report : The  Austrian Presidency intends to prepare conclusions to be adopted by the Competitiveness Council  on 29 November, focussing on monitoring , governance  and mainstreaming  of the EU industrial  strategy . Mainstreaming  of the industrial policy is important f or an effective implementation of the  strategy: therefore, a clearer governance structure for industrial policy  must be developed,  involving COM, MS and important stakeholders; high priority should be given to an integrated approach to competitiveness within the Competitiveness Council and between Council formations (Mainstreaming -Approach). An indicator framework as the first piece for a fully- fledged  monitoring mechanism has been elaborated by the HLG CompCro and will be finished during the Austrian Presi dency. The ideas for a Governance structure by better highlighting the tasks of the  existing institutions/fora and better linking them will be presented by a presidency Paper accompanying the Council Conclusions.  A policy debate is planned at the COMPET Co uncil on 27 September on the topic of "Rethinking  European Industry: Artificial Intelligence and Robotics". This debate will build on the outcome of discussions at informal meeting of Competitiveness ministers which will address digitisation of industry wi th a special focus on AI, skills and investments, notably for innovation infrastructures  such as Digital Innovation Hubs.  Two meetings of the High -Level Working Group on Competitiveness and Growth (HLG CompCro)  are also planned on 7 September and 8 November to provide guidance from Member States on the  coordinated plan on Artificial Intelligence  which will be finalized by the Member States’ Group  on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI   at the end of 2018.  
    11352/18    MS/gb  20  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      Planning AI – COMPET Council activities   • Informal meeting of EU Competitiveness Ministers: 16 July     • High Level Working Group Competitiveness and Growth:   7 September     • COMPET Council: 27 September    Rethinking European Industry: Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  (Policy debate)     • High -Level Working Group Competitiveness and Growth:   8 November     • COMPET Council: 29 November   Information on the HLG CompCro input for the coordinated plan on AI     • COMPET Council February 2019         2.  Linking up work tracks    Following the publication of the Commission Communication on AI, the first exchange between  Competitiveness ministers on this topic will take place during the informal meeting on 15 -16 July,  in Vienna. Ministers will discuss the challenges and opportunities that Artific ial Intelligence brings  to European industries, and they will reflect on the appropriate policy response taking into account the Commission proposals on Artificial Intelligence, the data package and the next multiannual financial framework.   The HLG CompCro  is mandated to provide concrete and timely input on new initiatives to the  Commission and to Member States for the preparation of the COMPET Council (via COREPER). Furthermore, its role is to contribute to discussions in the COMPET Council by linking new developments and deepening its discussions.  
    11352/18    MS/gb  21  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      In the current HLG CompCro programme covering the period July 2017 – December 2018, it is  underlined that as a strategic think tank, the HLG CompCro should look at developments that  characterize and affect the future of our industry. Digitalisation and digital innovation are part of the major challenges for all sectors. Therefore HLG CompCro work will provide relevant input on shaping a common view on the importance of a strong industrial base for innovation, creating synergies between R&D&I, industry and other sectors so that any industry, SME and start -up in  whatever location in the European Union can fully benefit from digital innovation.   The priority determined in 'Pillar II –  Industry and Business Climate' for the period falling under  AT Presidency is "digital transformation of industry and innovation ecosystems: chances and challenges." The HLG CompCro   meeting of 7 September will discuss "governance for Artificial  Intelligence", which, together with the output of the Informal COMPET Council, will feed into the Competitiveness Council policy debate "European Industry: Artificial Intelligence and Robotics" planned for 27 September. This policy debate could provide formal feedback from the Council on the strategy proposed by the Commission, take stock of the progress achieved on the development of a coordinated plan on AI at EU level, and focus on the role of digital innovation hubs and EU  programmes in the implementation of the EU AI strategy.   The topics identified by Member States through the Member Stat es’ Group on Digitising European  Industry (DEI) and AI  further to the meeting of 18 June and at the informal COMPET Council of  16/7 should serve as a basis for the discussions at he upcoming meetings of the HLG CompCro. This is reflected in the Presidency discussion paper for the HLG CompCro meeting of 7/9 which is under preparation and includes feedback from the Commission work tracks.  The discussions could notably cover efforts to increase investments in AI, research and innovation  infrastructures such as digital innovation hubs and excellence research centres, how to best prepare for future EU programmes (pipelines, pilot projects), joint priorities and collaboration actions which could be undertaken in the coordinated plan on Artificial Intelligence as a nnounced in the AI  Communication and called for by the European Council Conclusions of June. 
    11352/18    MS/gb  22  Annex to ANNEX  ECOMP.3   EN      Participation from one or a few member(s) of the High -Level Expert Group on Artificial  Intelligence (AI HLG) and Member States’ Group on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI  established by the Commission in the HLG CompCro as well as participation of the HLG CompCro Chair in the Member States’ Group on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI  and High- Level  Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLG) could also allow to link the work of the three groups.   Taking into account the outcome of the COMPET Council meeting of 27 September, where a mandate could be given to HLG CompCro to deliver input for the coordinated plan on AI to the Member States’ Group on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and AI, the HLG CompCro meeting of 8 November can be used to discuss first findings of the Member States’ Group on Digitising European Industry (DEI) and  AI (covering notably investment aspects) which then could be  discussed by the COMPET Council meeting in early 2019.
