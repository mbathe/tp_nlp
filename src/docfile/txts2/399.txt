Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (AIS)                                                                    
 
 
 
 
 
 




Overview


New technology comes with unknown obstacles and unintended risks requiring accountable design and lifecycle planning to ensure responsible innovation. As artificial intelligence, autonomous intelligent systems (AIS), machine learning, autonomous vehicles, and robotics advance at a rapid pace, careful considerations need to be made during development and implementation regarding humanity. At IEEE SA, our global community has developed resources and standards globally recognized in the area of applied ethics and systems engineering and continue to develop accessible and sustainable approaches and solutions for pragmatic application of AIS principles and frameworks. IEEE SA offers standards, training and education, certification programs, and more, to empower stakeholders designing, developing, and using AIS. Global participation is encouraged to offer the broadest regional and cultural perspectives required to best contextualize how AIS systems can avoid risk and offer greatest benefit in operation.

Report: Decoupling Human Characteristics from Algorithmic Capabilities
This report opens a conversation about decoupling anthropomorphic language from discussions around artificial intelligence in efforts to give agency to the public and decision makers. This is explored through the lens of the following human characteristics which are commonly attributed to AI Systems: Learn, Analyze, Knowledge, Foresight, and Decision-Making.




Report: Addressing Ethical Dilemmas in AI: Listening to Engineers
This report is based on the proceedings of the online hackathon “Ethical dilemmas in AI – engineering the way out”, conducted in September 2020. The goal of the hackathon was to identify the main challenges for integrating existing ethical principles and guidelines into the engineering processes that power AI development.





Measuring What Matters in the Era of Global Warming and the Age of Algorithmic Promises
At a physical level, human well being is critically dependent on environmental sustainability. Our symbiotic relationship with nature, however, has been severely damaged due to actions that have resulted in a climate crisis. A combination of a courageous socioeconomic transformation and accelerated technological innovation is necessary to mitigate this threat.
