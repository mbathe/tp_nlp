2   Preface     Research and development ( R&D)  and utilization of artificial intelligence ( AI) are  expected to progress dramatically in years to come .  Under these circumstances,  at the G7 Information and Communication Ministers Meeting in April 2016, Japan  as the host  nation  introduced principles of  AI development, over which the  relevant minister s then held discussions.  As a result, the G7 countries agreed  that they will continue to lead the discussions of "AI R& D Principles" and "AI R&D  Guidelines ," which  explains the principles , with the cooperation of international  organizations such as OECD.     With proactive development and utiliz ation of AI, Japan can solve various  problems arising from challenges  that it is confronted with (such as a declining  birthrate and aging population) .  Moreover , with the findings  obtained , Japan can  make significant  contribut ions to the international community by sharing matters  that are expected to be taken into account in the AI development .    This draft is  prepared as a basis for international discussions at G7 and OECD  regarding matters expected to be considered in R&D activities for promoting the  benefits and reducing  the risks of AI.  Considering that AI -related technolog ies  are in the middle of development, it is NOT appropriate to treat international AI  R&D Principles and AI R& D Guideline s, which  explains  the principles,  as aimed  for introduction of regulations.  Rather , this draft is  drawn up as a proposal of   guidelines that will be internationally shared as non- regulatory and non- binding  soft law .  It is expected that the deliberations  on such guidelines will :  • accelerate the participation of multistakeholders involved in R&D and utilization  of AI ( such as developers, service providers, users including civil society,  governments , and international organizations) at both national and  international levels, in t he discussions  towards establishing "AI R&D  Guidelines" and “AI Utilization Guidelines” ; and   • promote the international sharing of best practices in the R&D and utilization of  AI, which  will help gain the trust of users and the society in AI and facilitate  the  R&D and utilization of AI . 
3   Draft AI R&D GUIDELINES1    1. Purpose     R&D and utilization of AI are expected to progress rapidly in years to come .  In  the process of t he evolution  of AI networking ( that is a formation of networks in  which AI systems are connected,  over the Internet or other information -andcommunication  networks,  to each other or to  other types of systems ( which is   called “AI networks” hereafter) ), enormous  benefits are expected for  humans  as  well as the society and the economy in such manners as making significant   contributi ons to solving various problems that individuals, local communities,  countries , and the international  community2 are confronted  with.  The R&D and  utilization of AI should be accelerated in such a direction.     As part of this, from the viewpoint of  promot ing the benefits from  AI systems to  the society and the economy a s well as mitigat ing the risks such as lack of  transparency and loss of control, it becomes  necessary  to address  relevant social,  economic, ethical,  and legal issues.  In particular, services utiliz ing AI systems,  like other information- and-communication ones, will be  provided beyond national  borders via networks; therefore,  it is essential to share guidelines , which  serve  as non- regulatory and non- binding soft law,  and their best practices among  stakeholders ( such as developers, service providers, users including civil society,  governments,  and international organizations) through open discussions to foster  an international consensus, so that the benefits from AI systems will be increased  and risks with them be controlled.     In view of such  awareness, the Guideline s aim at protect ing the interest s of users  and deterring  the spread of risks , thus achieving  a human- centered “Wisdom  Network Society ”3 by way of  increasing the benefits and mitigating the risks of AI                                                      1 This draft has been prepared to be used for international discussions on the establishment  of an internationally shared AI R&D Guidelines.   2 For details on challenges faced by the international community, refer to the United  Nations “Sustainable Development Goals” (SDGs)   (http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/70/L.1)   3 A Wisdom Network Society  is a society where, as a result of the progress of AI networking,  humans live in harmony with AI networks, and data/information/knowledge are freely and 
4   systems through the sound progress of AI networks.     To achiev e the above- mentioned purpose, th e Guideline s compile  AI R&D  Principles,  which will be  expected to be consider ed in AI-system development  in  the future , along with comments on the Guidelines .    While  the R&D of AI systems covers various fields of the utilization , the benefits  and risks of the AI systems might  differ from field to field.  The Guidelines set  out matters common to those fields of AI utilization or matters  expected to be  considered with regard to the collaborations between the fields .  On the other  hand, for  matters expected to be considered according to the circumstances of  each field , it is hoped  that discussions on guidelines for each field, including  whether or not such guidelines should be established, will be held by concerned  stakeholders including relevant international organizations in the  fields ,  separately from the Guidelines .    Moreover, AI systems’  outputs or programs might  continuously  change as a result  of learning or other methods in the process of the utilization; therefore,  while there  are matters that the developers are expected to mind, there are other matters  that users are expected to mind, too.  For this reason, international discussions  as to  whether to formulate AI utilization guidelines are expected, in addition to the  Guid eline.      2. Basic Philosophies     Recognizing its  purpose, the Guideline s shall be based upon five  basic  philosophies  as follows :    1. To achieve a human- centered society  where all human beings across the  board enjoy the benefits  from their life in harmony with AI networks,  while  human dignity and individual autonomy  are respected.                                                         safely created, distributed, and linked to form a wisdom network , encouraging collaborations  beyond space among people, things, and events in various fields and consequently enabling  creative and vibrant developments.  
5   2. To share the Guidelines , as non- binding soft law,  and their best practices   internationally among stakeholders , as, with the rapid development of the  R&D and utilization of AI , networked AI systems are expected to have broad   and significant  impact s on human beings and society beyond national borders .    3. To ensure an appropriate  balance between the benefits and risks of AI  networks , so as to: (a)  promote the benefits from AI networks through  innovative and open R&D activities and fair competition ; and (b)  mitigate  the  risk that AI systems might  infringe rights or interests,  while fully respecting the  value of the democratic society such as academic freedom and freedom of  expression.     4. To make sure that AI R&D activities based on specific technologies or  techniques  are not hindered in light of ensuring technological neutrality , and  to be mindful that developers are not  imposed of excessive burden , as  the rapid progress of AI -related technologies is anticipated to continue.  And     5. To constantly re view the  Guideline s and flexibly revise them  as  necessary  through international discussions, considering the extent of the  progress of AI networking , because AI-related technologies and AI utilization  are expected to continue to advance dramatically .  Also, to strive for broad  and flexible discussions including the involvement of related stakeholders ,  when reviewing the  Guideline s.      3. Definition of Terms and Scope     3-1 Definition of Terms     In view of the basic philosophies  stated in Section 2,  the terms related to “AI”  used in th e Guidelines  are defined as follows :  • "AI" refers to a concept that collectively refers to AI software and AI system s.4                                                      4 This definition of AI is assumed in the Guidelines to apply mainly to N arrow AI which has  already been put into practical application.  In anticipation of rapid technological progress  related to AI such as autonomous AI and artificial general intelligence (AGI), however, it will 
6   • "AI software" refers to software that has functions to change its own output s  or program s in the process  of the utilization , by learning data, information, or  knowledge; or by  other methods5.  For example, machine learning software  is classified into this category .  • "AI system s" refers to system s that incorporate AI software as a component.    For instance, r obots and cloud systems that implement  AI software  are  classified into this category .    "Developers" and "users" of AI system s are defined as follows , although it should  be noted that they are relative concepts in that who are  developer s or user s  depends on the  situation:   • "Developer s" refers  to those  who conduct the R&D of AI system s (which  includ es R&D using AI system s), including those providing to others AI network  service s using AI system s that they have developed  on their own.   • “Users" refers  to those  who use AI system s, including end users  as well as  providers who provide third part ies with AI -network  service s developed by  others.     3-2 Scope     The Guidelines cover AI systems  that can be networked (i.e. connected to  networks) , since they can be used across national borders via networks, thereby  widely bringing about benefits and risks to humans and society.     The Guidelines cover broadly all developers  as defined in Section 3-1, given that  the Guidelines serve as non- binding soft law.                                                         also be able to cover various types of AI to be developed in the future if they have functions  to change their own outputs or programs by learning or other methods.   In the Guidelines, the definition of AI as described above, which comes from the standpoint  of ensuring the technological neutrality set forth in the fourth basic philosophy, may apply to  a variety of AI to be developed in the future depending on their functions.  How to define AI  in the Guidelines needs to be continuously discussed based on the trends of the  technological progress of AI, etc.   5 Methods other than learning, which might cause AI software to change its own outputs or  programs, include inferences based on data, information, and knowledge; and interactions  with the environment through sensors, actuators, etc.  
7   The Guidelines cover development  at a stage of connect ion to network s, but not  include one within closed spaces (such as laborator ies or sandbox es in which  security is sufficiently ensured)  in view of respect for academic freedom, the  magnitude of the impact on society , and so on.       4. AI R&D Principles     (Principles mainly concerning the sound development of AI networking and the  promotion of the benefits of AI systems )  1) Principle  of collaboration―Developers should pay attention to the  interconnectivity and interoperability of AI systems .    (Principles mainly concerning  mitigat ion of  risks associated with AI system s)  2) Principle  of transparency― Developers should pay attention to the  verifiability of input s/output s of AI systems and the explainability of their   judgment s.  3) Principle  of controllability― Developers should pay attention to the  controllability of AI systems .  4) Principle  of safety― Developers should take it into consideration that AI  systems will not harm the life, body,  or property of user s or third part ies  through actuators  or other devices .  5) Principle  of security― Developers should pay attention to the security of  AI systems .  6) Principle  of privacy― Developers should take it into consideration that AI  systems will not infringe the privacy of users or third parties.   7) Principle  of ethics ―Developers should respect human dignity and  individual autonomy in R&D of AI systems.     (Principles mainly concerning improvement s in acceptance  by users  et al.)  8) Principle  of user assistance―Developers should take it into   consideration that AI systems will support users and make it possible to 
8   give them  opportunities  for choice in appropriate manners .  9) Principle  of accountability― Developers should make efforts  to fulfill  their accountability to  stakeholders including AI systems’ users.       5. Comments on AI R&D Principles     1) Principle  of collaboration―Developers should pay attention to the  interconnectivity and interoperability of AI s ystems.     [Comment ]  Developers should give consideration to the interconnectivity and   interoperability6 between the AI system s that they have developed and other AI  systems, etc. with consideration of  the diversity of AI systems so that : (a) the  benefits of AI systems should increase through the sound progress of AI  networking ; and that (b) multiple developers ’ efforts  to control the risks should be  coordinated well  and operate effectively .  For this, developers should pay  attention to the followings :  • To make e fforts to cooperate to share relevant information which is effective  in ensur ing interconnectivity and interoperability.   • To make efforts to  develop AI system s conforming to international standards ,  if any .  • To make efforts to address  the standardization of data formats and the  openness of interfaces and protocols including application programming  interface ( API).  • To p ay attention to risks of unintended events as a result of the  interconnection or inter operations between  AI systems t hat they have  developed and other AI systems, etc.   • To make efforts to promote open and fair treatment of license agreement s                                                      6 The interoperability and interconnectivity in this context expects that AI systems which  developers have developed can be connected t o information- and-communication networks,  thereby can operate with other AI systems, etc. in mutually and appropriately harmonized  manners.  
9   for and their conditions  of intellectual property rights,  such as standard  essential patents,  contributing to ensuring the interconnectivity and  interoperability between AI systems and other AI systems , etc., while taking  into consideration the balance between the protection and the utilization with  respect to intellectual property related to the development of AI.     2) Princip le of transparency ―Developers should pay attention to the  verifi abilit y of input s/output s of AI systems and the explain ability of their   judgment s7.    [Comment ]  AI systems which are supposed to be  subject to this principle are  such ones  that  might  affect the life, body, freedom, privacy,  or property of user s or third part ies.    It is desirable that developers pay attention to the verifiability of the input s and  output s of AI systems as well as  the explainability of the judgment  of AI systems   within a reasonable scope  in light of the characteristics of the technolog ies to be  adopted  and their use, so as to obtain the understanding and trust of the society  including users of AI systems.     3) Principle  of c ontrollability ―Developers should pay attention to the  controllability of AI systems .    [Comment ]  In order to assess the risks related to the controllability of AI system s, it is  encouraged that developers make effort s to conduct  verification  and validation8  in advance9.  One of the conceivable methods of risk assessment is to conduct                                                      7 Note that this principle is not intended to ask developers to disclose algorithms, source  codes, or learning data.   In interpreting this principle, consideration to privacy and trade  secrets is also required.   8 Verification and validation are methods for evaluating and controlling risks in advance.   Generally, the former is used for confirming formal consistency, whil e the latter is used for  confirming substantial validity. ( See, e.g., The Future of Life Institute (FLI), Research  Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence (2015)).   9 Examples of what to see in the risk assessment are risks of reward ha cking  in which AI  systems formally achieve the goals assigned but substantially do not meet the developer's  intents, and risks that AI systems work in ways that the developers have not intended due to 
10   experiments in a closed space such as in a laboratory or a sandbox  in which  security is ensured,  at a stage before the practical application in society.     In addition, in order to ensure the controllability  of AI systems, it is encouraged  that developers pay attention to whether  the supervision ( such as monitoring or  warnings) and countermeasures ( such as system shutdown, cut -off from  networks, or  repairs)  by humans or other trustworthy AI system s are effective, to  the extent possible in light of the characteristics of the technolog ies to be adopted.     4) Principle  of safety― Developers should take it into consideration that AI  systems will not harm the life, body, or property of user s or third part ies  through actuators  or other devices .    [Comment ]  AI systems which a re supposed to be  subject to this principle are such ones  that  might  harm the life, body,  or property of user s or third part ies through actuators  or other  devices .    It is encouraged that d evelopers refer to relevant international standards and pay  attention to the followings, with particular consideration of  the possibility that  output s or programs might  change as a result of learning  or other methods  of AI  systems:   ● To make efforts to conduct  verification and validation in advance in order to  assess and mitigate  the risks related to the safety of the AI systems .  ● To make  effort s to implement measures,  throughout the development stage  of AI systems to the extent possible  in light of the characteristics of the  technolog ies to be adopted , to contribute to the intrinsic safety (reduction of  essential risk factors such as kinetic energy of actuator s) and the functional  safety ( mitigation  of risks by operation of additional control devices such as  automatic braking) when AI systems work  with actuators  or other devices .   And                                                      the changes of their outputs and programs in the proces s of the utiliz ation with their learning,  etc.  For reward hacking, see , e.g., Dario Amodei, Chris Olah, Jacob Steinhardt, Paul  Christiano, John Schulman & Dan Mané,  Concrete Problems in AI Safety , arXiv:  1606.06565  [cs.AI] (2016). 
11   ● To m ake effort s to explain the designers’ intent  of AI systems and the reasons  for it to stakeholders such as users , when developing AI systems to be used   for making judgments regarding  the safety of life, body,  or property of  users  and third parties (for example, such judgments  that prioritizes  life, body,  property  to be protected at the time of an accident of a robot equipped with  AI).    5) Principle  of security― Developers should pay attention to the security of  AI systems.     [Comment ]  In addition to respect ing international guidelines on security such as  “OECD  Guidelines for the Security of I nformation Systems and Networks,”  it is  encouraged that developers pay attention to the followings, with consideration of   the possibility that AI systems might  change their output s or programs as a result  of learning  or other methods:   ● To pay attention, as necessary, to the reliability ( that is, whether the  operations are performed as intended and not steered by unauthorized third  parties) and robustness ( that is, tolerance to physical attacks and accidents)   of AI systems, in addition to: (a) confidentiality; (b) integrity; and (c)  availability  of information  that are usually required for ensuring the  information security of AI systems .  ● To make efforts to conduct verification and validation in advance in order to  assess and control the risks related to the security of AI system s.  ● To make e fforts to take measures to maintain the security  to the extent  possible in light of the characteristics of the technolog ies to be adopted   throughout  the process of the development of AI systems  (“security by  design”).     6) Principle  of privacy―Developers should take it into consideration that AI  systems will not infringe the privacy of users  or third parties.     [Comment ]  The privacy referred to in this principle includes spatial privacy (peace of personal 
12   life), information  privacy  (personal data),  and secrecy of communications .   Developers should consider international guidelines on privacy, such as  “OECD  Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data,”   as well as the followings,  with consideration of  the possibility that AI systems   might  change their output s or programs as a result of learning  and other methods:   ● To make efforts to evaluate the risk s of privacy infringement  and conduct  privacy impact assessment in advance.   ● To make effort s to take  necessary  measures,  to the extent possible in light of  the characteristics of the technolog ies to be adopted through out the process  of development of the AI systems  (“privacy by design”), to avoid infringement  of privacy at the time of the utilization.     7) Principle  of ethics―Developers should respect human dignity and  individual autonomy in the R&D of AI systems.     [Comment ]  It is encouraged that, when developing AI systems that link  with the human brain  and body,  developers pay particularly due consideration to respecting human  dignity and individual autonomy , in light of  discussions on bioethics, etc.     It is also encouraged that, t o the extent possible in light of the characteristics of  the technolog ies to be adopted, developers make effort s to take necessary  measures so as not to cause unfair discrimination resulting from prejudice  included in the learning data of the AI system s.    It is advisable that developers take precautions to ensure that AI systems do not  unduly infringe the value of h umanity , based on the International Human Rights  Law and the International Humanitarian Law.     8) Principle  of user assistance―Developers should take it into   consideration that AI systems will support users and make it possible to  give them  opportunities  for choice  in appropriate manners .    [Comment ] 
13   In order to support users of AI systems, it is recommended that developers pay  attention to the following s:   ● To make e fforts to make available interfaces that provide in a timely and  appropriate manner the information that can help users’ decisions  and are  easy -to-use for the m.   ● To make effort s to give consideration to make availabl e functions that provide  users with opportunit ies for choice in a timely and appropriate manner (e.g.,  default settings, easy -to-understand options, feedback s, emergency  warnings, handling of errors, etc.).   And    ● To make e fforts to take measures to make AI systems easier to use for  socially -vulnerable people such as universal design.     In addition, it is recommended that  developers make efforts to provide users with  appropriate information considering  the possibility of changes in output s or  program s as a result of learning or other methods  of AI systems.     9) Principle  of accountability―Developers should make efforts  to fulfill  their accountability to  stakeholders including AI systems’ users.     [Comment ]  Developers are expected to fulfill their  accountability for AI systems they have  developed to gain users’  trust in AI systems.     Specifically, it is encouraged that developers make effort s to provide users with   the information that can help their choice  and utilization of AI systems.   In  addition, in order to improve the acceptance of AI systems by the society  including users, it is also encouraged that, taking into account the R&D principles  (1) to (8) set forth  in the Guidelines, developers make efforts: (a)  to provide users   et al. with both information and explan ations about  the technical characteristics  of the AI systems they have developed; and (b) to gain  active involvement of  stakeholders  (such as their feedback) in such manners as  to hear  various views   through dialogues with diverse stakeholders.     Moreover , it is advisable that developers make efforts to share the information 
14   and cooperate with providers et al. who  offer services with the AI systems they  have developed on their own.   
15   Attachment: Roles Expected to Be Taken by Related  Stakeholders     Based on the purpose of the Guideline s, the stakeholders of relevant industries,  academia,  and governments are expected to play the following roles , for  example:     1. Each country’s government  and international organizations are expected to  make efforts to improve the environment for promoting dialogue s among  various stakeholders  such as  governments, international organizations,  developers, users including civil society , in the operation and rev iew of the  Guidelines .  2. Relevant stakeholders such as developers and users including  the civil  society are expected to make effort s to participate in the dialogues   mentioned above, share best practices conforming to the Guideline s, and  also share common perceptions about the promotion of  the benefits and the  mitig ation of  the risks of AI, while ensuring  the diversity of discussions over  AI.  3. Standardiz ation bodies and other related entities  are expected to prepare  and release  recommended models  that conform to the Guidelines.   4. Each country’s government  is expected to: (a)  provide assistance  to AI developer communities  towards solving challenges such as increasing the  benefits from AI and mitigating the risks as stated in the Gu idelines; and (b)   actively promote  policies to support the R&D of AI .
