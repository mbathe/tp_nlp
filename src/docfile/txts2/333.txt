The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR 2   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes  one of its foundational rationales in Recital 4, stating that “the processing of personal  data should be designed to serve mankind.” This refers to any processing of personal  data, from its collection to its various uses, as simple as keeping a record about one’s  purchases at their favorite grocery store and as complex as using personal data for automated  decision-making, such as pre-screening candidates for a job through the use of algorithms, or  having personal data result from complex processing, like creating a profile of the customer  of a grocery store on the basis of their purchase history.1 The same underlying rationale of the  GDPR applies if personal data are in any way processed as part of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)  or Machine Learning (ML) application2 — either as input or output of such processing.   While all the provisions of the GDPR apply to such complex processing of personal data —  from the obligation of the controller to have a lawful ground for processing in place,3 to the  obligation to ensure that the processing is done fairly and transparently4, to more technical  obligations like ensuring an adequate level of data security5 and ensuring that the protection  of personal data is baked into the design of a processing operation,6 one particular provision  of the GDPR is specifically applicable to decisions “based solely on automated processing [of  personal data — n.], including profiling, which produces legal effects” concerning an individual  “or similarly affects” that individual: Article 22.  This provision enshrines one of the “rights of the data subject,”7 particularly “the right not to  be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing” which has a legal or similarly  significant effect on the individual. All automated-decision making (ADM) that meets these  criteria as defined in Article 22 GDPR is referred to as “qualifying ADM” in this Report.  Even if apparently introduced in the GDPR to respond to the current age of algorithms, AI and ML  systems, this provision has in fact existed under the former EU Data Protection Directive adopted  in 1995, and has its roots in a similar provision of the first French data protection law adopted  in the late 1970s (see Section 1.1 of the Report). However, it has only scarcely been enforced  under previous law. Cases started to pick up after the GDPR became applicable in 2018, also  considering that automated decision-making is becoming ubiquitous in daily life, and it now looks  like individuals are increasingly interested in having their right under Article 22 applied.   This Report outlines how national courts and Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) in the EU/ European Economic Area (EEA) and UK have interpreted and applied the relevant GDPR  provisions on ADM so far, as well as the notable trends and outliers in this respect. To compile  the Report, we have looked into publicly available judicial and administrative decisions and  regulatory guidelines across EU/EEA jurisdictions and the UK,  which was a member of the EU  until December 2020 and whose rules on ADM are still an implementation of the GDPR at the  time of writing this Report. To complement the facts of the cases discussed, we have also looked  into press releases, annual reports and media stories.  This research is limited to documents released until April 2022, and it draws from more than  70 cases — 19 court rulings and more than 50 enforcement decisions, individual opinions  or general guidance issued by DPAs, — from a span of 18 EEA Member-States, the UK and  the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). The main cases and documents used for  reference are listed in Annex I. The Report primarily contains case summaries, as well as  relevant guidelines, with the cases explored in detail being numbered consistently so that all  the notes on a particular case can be easily identified throughout the document (e.g. Case 3 will  be referred to several times, under different sections). BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW
Background and Overview AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     3The cases we identified often stem from situations of daily life where ADM is increasingly  playing a significant role. For instance, one cluster of cases envisages students and educational  institutions. These cases vary from the use of live Facial Recognition technologies to manage  access on school premises and recording of attendance, to online proctoring and further to fully  automated grading based on the individual profile of a student, but also on the profile of their  school district, as a substitute of highschool graduation exams during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Another significant cluster of cases has at its core the situation of gig workers and the way they  are being distributed shifts, gigs, income and penalties through their respective platforms. A  significant number of cases challenge automated credit scoring. The way in which governments  distribute social benefits, like unemployment, and manage tax avoidance and potential fraud is  increasingly subject to more cases — individual challenges or ex officio investigations. We also  encountered cases where the underlying ADM was challenged in situations like the issuing  of gun licenses, scraping publicly available sources to build an FR product, or profiling of  prospective clients by a bank.  Our analysis will show that the GDPR as a whole is relevant for ADM cases and has been  effectively applied to protect the rights of individuals in such cases, even in those situations where  the ADM at issue does not meet the high threshold established by Article 22 GDPR, and the right  not to be subject to solely automated decision-making is not applicable. For instance, without  even analyzing whether Article 22 applies in those cases — Courts and DPAs have found that the  deployment of live FR applications to manage access to school premises and monitor attendance  was unlawful under other provisions of the GDPR because it did not have a lawful ground for  processing in place and it did not respect the requirements of necessity and proportionality, thus  protecting the rights of students in France and Sweden (see Cases 30 and 31). A comparative reading of relevant cases will also show how complex transparency  requirements are considered in practice, being effectively translated into a right of individuals  to receive a high level explanation about the parameters that led to an individual automated  decision concerning them or about how profiling applied to them.  The principles of lawfulness and fairness are applied separately in ADM related cases, with the  principle of fairness gaining momentum in enforcement. For instance, in one of the most recent  cases enshrined in the Report, the Dutch DPA found that the algorithmic system used by the  government to automatically detect fraud in social benefits requests breached the principle of  fairness, since the processing was considered “discriminatory” for having taken into account the  dual nationality of the people requesting childcare benefits. Another important point that surfaced from our research is that when enforcers are assessing  the threshold of applicability for Article 22 (“solely” automated, and “legal or similarly significant  effect” of ADM on individuals), the criteria used are increasingly sophisticated as the body  of case-law grows. For example, Courts and DPAs are looking at the entire organizational  environment where an ADM is taking place, from the organization structure, to reporting lines  and the effective training of staff, in order to decide whether a decision was “solely” automated  or had meaningful human involvement. Similarly, when assessing the second criterion for  the applicability of Article 22, enforcers are looking whether the input data for an automated  decision includes inferences about the behavior of individuals, and whether the decision affects  the conduct and choices of the persons targeted, among other multi-layered criteria. 
4   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMBackground and Overview Finally, we should highlight that in virtually all cases where an ADM process was found to be  unlawful, DPAs went beyond issuing administrative fines by also ordering specific measures  which varied in scope: orders to halt practices, orders to delete the illegally collected personal  data, orders to prohibit further collecting personal data.  All of the sections of the Report are accompanied by summaries of cases and brief analysis  pointing out commonalities and outliers. The Report initially explores the context and key  elements of Article 22 and other relevant GDPR provisions that have been applied in ADM  cases, all of them reflected in concrete examples (Section 1). Then, it delves into how the twopronged threshold required by Article 22 GDPR has been interpreted and applied in practice  (Section 2). Finally, Section 3 brings forward how Courts and DPAs have applied Article 22  in sectoral areas, namely in employment, live facial recognition and credit scoring matters.  The Conclusion will lay out some of the identified legal interpretation and application trends  that surface from our research and highlight remaining areas of legal uncertainty that may be  clarified in the future by regulators or the CJEU (Section 4). 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     5Article 22 Automated individual decision-making,   including profiling 1.   The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision  based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which  produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly  affects him or her. 2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision: (a) is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract  between the data subject and a data controller; (b) is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller  is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard  the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or (c) is based on the data subject’s explicit consent. 3.   In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data  controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data  subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the  right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to  express his or her point of view and to contest the decision. 4.  Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special  categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point (a) or  (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data  subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.1. THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ARTICLE 22 GDPR
6   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR 1.1  ADM provisions have been enshrined in data  protection laws since the 1970s The effects of Automated Decision Making and profiling on individuals have been one of the  key concerns of legislators as far back as the 1970s, from the very emergence of automation  and computers. The way they dealt with this concern was by proposing and adopting data  protection legislation, with strong principles and rights for individuals. For instance, the  French Data Protection Act of 1978  specifically prohibited  ADM in the context of judicial,  administrative, or private decisions  involving assessment of human behavior that would profile  or define the personality of the individual,8 while granting individuals a right to know and a right  to challenge the information and the reasoning used by automated processing affecting them.9  In 1995, the EU aimed to harmonize national data protection laws in its Member States through  the Data Protection Directive, and included a provision similar to the one in the French law,  resulting in Article 15 on “Automated individual decisions.”10 The right not to be subject to solely automated decision-making as provided by Article 22 of  the GDPR replicates this right and adds to it. While the core of the right is the same (“not to be  subject to a decision which produces legal effects” concerning the individual “or significantly  affects” them, and “which is based solely on automated processing of data”), there are a few  differences between Article 15 DPD and Article 22 GDPR. First, the DPD did not mention individual consent as an exemption for controllers who wished  to conduct such ADM, providing contract and legal obligations as the only permissible grounds.  Second, the DPD specifically referred to automated processing intended to evaluate certain  aspects about targeted individuals, language which has been transposed into the current  definition of profiling under the GDPR. In any case, for ADM to be covered by Article 22 GDPR,  it does not need to entail any form of profiling, which was not the case under Article 15 DPD.  Case 1: Statistical analyses of defendants in criminal cases are not qualifying ADM Case law interpreting Article 15 of the 1995 Data Protection Directive is scarce. One of the few  judicial decisions of note is a 1998 ruling from the French Supreme Court ( Cour de Cassation ),  in which the Court held that Article 15 did not apply to the use of statistical comparisons of  a defendants’ professional activities (medical acts performed and fees charged) with that of  colleagues from the same profession — in the case at hand, other masseur-physiotherapists —  in a specific criminal case, by means of computer systems. In the particular criminal case, the  Court found that the statistical analyses had not been conducted in such a way as to define  the profile or personality of the persons concerned in the proceedings.11 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     7The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  Case 2: Personalized rates for users of a car sharing service are qualifying ADM Much later, in January 2018, the Italian DPA ( Garante ) found that a controller who offered  personalized rates to the users of its car sharing service, on the basis of their collected hab its and characteristics, was profiling data subjects for the purposes of the Italian law which  transposed Article 15 DPD. During the respective administrative procedure, the defendant  disagreed, arguing that there was no “categorization” of the service’s users, as the data  used for the rates’ calculation were not permanently associated with the subjects. The DPA  dismissed the defendant’s arguments, stating that it was undeniable that, in this case, there  was: a) personal data processing; b) based solely on automated processing; and c) aimed at  defining the profile or personality or at analyzing habits or consumption choices of individ uals.12 This decision — which led to a 60.000 EUR administrative fine — was confirmed by  the Italian Supreme Court (Corte Suprema de Cassazione) in November 2021. In the appeal  procedure, the Supreme Court sided with the Garante, as it held that processing personal  data through an algorithm to calculate a personalized rate is considered profiling, even if the  data is not attributable to the data subject nor stored by the controller.13  In another consequential case of applying Article 15 DPD, the French Data Protection Authority  (CNIL) found that the University admission system used in France breached the right not to be  subject to ADM as provided by the DPD and ordered universities to put in place a procedure  which involved meaningful human intervention (see Case 25 below). 1.2  The EDPB interprets Article 22 as an a priori   prohibition on engaging in qualifying ADM   EU Member-States transposed Article 15 DPD into their national legal systems in considerably  different ways. While some (like Belgium) framed their national ADM provisions as a qualifying ADM  prohibition, others (like Sweden) saw Article 15 as requiring Member-States to grant individuals a  right to opt-out from ADM. The text of Article 22 GDPR was intended to lay down a uniform set of  rules on ADM across the EU and to settle these diverging readings. The issue of the nature of  Article 22 — whether it is a prohibition (with exceptions) or a right for individuals to exercise  in order to be effective — still sparks academic debate.14 And this debate is of consequence:  if Article 22 provides for a prohibition, then controllers must a priori abstain from engaging in  qualifying ADM unless one of the exceptions applies. Whereas if Article 22 provides for a right that  needs to be exercised, then controllers can engage in qualifying ADM regarding an individual until  that individual specifically requests not to be subject to it.15 While the academic debate is ongoing, the EDPB has taken the view that Article 22 provides for  a prohibition, by stating in an Opinion from 2018 that:  “The term right  in the provision does not mean that Article 22(1) applies only when actively  invoked by the data subject. Article 22(1) establishes a general prohibition for decision-making  based solely on automated processing. This prohibition applies whether or not the data subject  takes an action regarding the processing of their personal data.”16 Like for other provisions of EU law, the CJEU has ultimate authority to interpret Article 22  GDPR, but it has not yet adjudicated on its content. Questions for a preliminary ruling to 
8   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR clarify the content and scope of Article 22 GDPR have been sent to the CJEU in 2021 by the  Administrative Court of Wiesbaden (Germany) in the SCHUFA case (C-634/21), and by the  Vienna Regional Administrative Court (Austria) in February 2022. The former is further explored  in Section 3.3 (as Case 39), and the latter in Section 1.6.c (as Case 14) below.  1.3  There are three conditions that trigger the  applicability of Article 22 GDPR For Article 22(1) GDPR to apply, there are three cumulative conditions that need to be met by  the processing of personal data underlying the automated decision-making: the processing  needs to underpin (a) a decision (b) based solely on automated processing or profiling (c) that  has legal or similarly significant effects on an individual (“data subject”). a) The first element requires the existence of a “ decision ” as the result of the underlying  data processing operation, which involves taking a particular resolution regarding a  person, formal enough to be “distinguished from other steps that prepare, support,  complement or head off decision-making.”17 b) Regarding the requirement that such a decision is “ based solely on automated processing, ”  the EDPB has clarified that this means that no human has meaningful  involvement in the  decision-making process. In its dedicated Guidelines on ADM and Profiling, the EDPB does  not give a concrete example of a system where this may happen. It merely mentions an  “automated process” that “produces what is in effect a recommendation concerning a data  subject.”18 This example is very broad and it could potentially capture systems as varied as  automated recommendation for interviewing a job applicant, to automated recommendation  for receiving a credit or not, to other automated recommender systems. The EDPB adds that  if a “human being reviews and takes account of other factors in making the final decisions,”  then that ADM is not “based solely” on automated processing. Further, controllers cannot  avoid Article 22 by having a human merely rubber-stamp machine-based decisions, without  actual authority or competence to alter their outcome.19 By contrast, if the automated  process at hand merely provides input for a decision to be ultimately taken by a human, the  processing underlying it is not in the scope of Article 22(1) GDPR.20 Courts across the EU  have found that some (often limited) degree of human involvement in a number of disputed  cases was enough to set aside the application of the provision (see Section 2.1 below). The third condition refers to the nature of the effects that these automated decisions  must have on individuals: “legal effects” or “similarly significant effects.” According to the  EDPB, a decision has legal effects on individuals where it affects his or her legal status or  rights (including under a contract). Examples given by the guidelines include canceling  a contract or denying a social benefit to a person. Decisions that “similarly significantly  affect” a person are less clear-cut, as shown by our research (see Section 2.2 below). The  EDPB considers that this criterion encompasses decisions that potentially (i) significantly  affect the circumstances, behaviour or choices of the individuals concerned, (ii) have  a prolonged or permanent impact on the data subject, or (iii) lead to the exclusion or  discrimination of individuals.21 Recital 71 of the GDPR provides useful examples of such  decisions: automatically refusing online credit or job applications. The EDPB also includes  in its ADM guidelines a nuanced opinion on whether some forms of online behavioral  advertising  may fall within the scope of Article 22, suggesting that this indeed is the case.  However, the EDPB stresses that the answer depends on assessing a number of factors 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     9The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  in each specific case (e.g., the intrusiveness of any profiling at stake and whether it uses  knowledge about targeted data subjects’ vulnerabilities).22  1.4  Only legal obligations, contract and consent can  justify qualifying ADM Article 22(2) GDPR lists three exceptions, or permissible uses for qualifying ADM: indent (a)  refers to ADM which is necessary for entering into or performing a contract with the data  subject; indent (b) covers ADM which is legally authorized; and indent (c) opens up the  possibility or relying on data subject consent.  a) As per indent (a), the provision demands that the ADM is strictly necessary for contractual  purposes.23 This means that the controller must assess whether there are no other  effective and less privacy-intrusive means to achieve the purpose of the processing of  personal data underlying the qualifying ADM. According to the EDPB, this requires the  controller to “demonstrate how the main subject-matter of the specific contract with the  data subject cannot, as a matter of fact, be performed if the specific processing of the  personal data in question does not occur,” also taking into account the data subject’s  expectations.24 The United Kingdom’s DPA, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO),  offers a more nuanced view, stating that the paragraph’s wording allows ADM as a targeted  and reasonable way of meeting the controller’s contractual obligations.25  Case 3: Algorithmic management of gig workers  could be justified as   contractual necessity In its July 2021 decision to fine food delivery company Deliveroo for unlawful  data practices regarding the algorithmic management of its riders, the Italian DPA  (Garante) agreed that it can be argued the “Frank” algorithm was necessary to  manage Deliveroo’s contractual relationship with the riders.26 For further details about  this case, see our analysis in Chapters 1.5, 1.6.d, and 3.1 below.  Indent (a) may also cover cases where ADM is objectively necessary for the controller  to take certain pre-contractual steps. The EDPB guidance mentions the production of a  shortlist with job applicants as an example, in cases where the controller has received a  very high number of applications.     Guidelines from national DPAs on automated recruiting processes The DPA from the German State of Baden-Württemberg has taken a more  conservative stance in this regard. In its 2020 Annual Report, it stated that using  algorithms which automatically analyze job applicants’ writing from their CVs and  cover letters and thereby decide on whether they continue or are dropped from  the process, amounts to ADM that could only be carried out with prior applicants’  consent under paragraph (2)(c).27
10   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR b) The second indent on legally-mandated or authorized qualifying ADM  states that the  authorizing Member State or EU law must lay down “suitable measures to safeguard the  data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests.” Such measures may include  a right for data subjects to obtain human intervention from the controller, to express their  points of view and to contest automated decisions.     Member State Law: Estonian Unemployment Insurance Act  For instance, this is the case in Section 23(4) of the Estonian Unemployment  Insurance Act , which allows the Unemployment Insurance Fund to decide on the  attribution or rejection of unemployment benefits to applicants in a solely automated  fashion after scanning State-controller databases for relevant information. At that  moment, applicants are informed that the decision was automated, that they have a  right to be heard and to submit a request for internal review.28    However, laws authorizing ADM can go beyond such requirements.   Belgian DPA Opinion: Remote reading of electricity consumption is  qualifying ADM A 2019 opinion from the Belgian DPA (APD) on a draft law proposal regulating  the remote reading of electricity consumptions by Belgian citizens through  smart-meters stated that the automated authorization or refusal of collective selfconsumption operations by the competent energy authority (CWaPE), based on  citizens’ consumption patterns, would constitute legally-authorized ADM for the  purposes of Article 22(2)(b) GDPR. Therefore, the ANP suggested the Wallonian  government include certain data subject safeguards in the final text of the law, such  as allowing data subjects to demonstrate that a specific consumption pattern was  due to a transitory situation.29 It is noteworthy that, even where certain ADM or profiling practices do not prima facie  fall  under Article 22(1) GDPR, there may be a need for national legislators to enshrine into law  additional safeguards for the protection of data subjects.
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     11The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  Case 4: Automated risk assessments of individuals by Tax Authorities  require additional legal protections On November 10, 2021, the Slovak Constitutional Court delivered its ruling on  the legality of an information system managed and used by the Slovakian Tax  Authority to detect potential instances of tax fraud (the “e-kasa” system).30 Under  Slovak law, every receipt issued by a seller (or “trader”) — including the seller’s tax  identification number [TIN] and its customers’ unique buyer identifier (which could  be the latter’s TIN or loyalty program participant number) — is sent in real-time to  the e-kasa system, which then uses such data to automatically draw risk profiles of  all sellers in matters of tax evasion or fraud. Based on the list obtained therefrom,  the Authority’s employees prioritize their supervisory activities, including individual  checks on sellers. The Court found that this constituted an “automated assessment”  of traders, who may also be natural persons. According to the Court, “The fact that  the system itself does not make a decision on whether to carry out a tax or other  control is not relevant,” but rather that the “automation refers to the evaluation of a  person [i.e., a trader] on the basis of his personal data.”31 In this respect, although the  Court notes that the GDPR already includes certain obligations for controllers (such  as carrying out a DPIA), the Slovak Constitution requires that additional measures  are introduced by law to protect individuals when automated assessments by  State agencies are at stake,  such as: (i) ensuring that the criteria, models or linked  databases used in that context are up-to-date, reliable and non-discriminatory; (ii)  ensuring that individuals are aware of the existence, scope and impact of his or  her automated assessment; (iii) checking the system’s quality, including its error  rate (both before and while the system is put to use, e.g., through audits, reporting  and statistics); and (iv) enshrining redress rights for individuals to effectively defend  themselves against the system’s errors and imperfections.32  c) The third indent mentions “ explicit consent ” as a way to legitimize qualifying ADM. The  EDPB has clarified that this entails additional efforts from controllers to obtain, when  compared to “regular” consent under Articles 4(11), 6(1)(a) and 7 GDPR. In this context,  controllers may want to ask data subjects to submit a signed written statement, file an  electronic form or send an email expressing their will to be subject to ADM.33 Other  requirements relating to free, specific, unambiguous and informed consent also apply. 
12   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR Case 5: Insufficiently informed consent is not valid to allow Article 22 GDPR  qualifying ADM  On May 25, 2021, Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation (Corte Suprema de Cassazione)   ruled that consent is not valid if the individual is subject to an ADM system that may  influence his or her rights when he or she is not adequately informed about the logic  behind it.  In the case at hand, individuals voluntarily uploaded documents containing  personal data to an online platform managed by the defendant (Associazione Mevaluate  Onlus). The IT system would then assign a ‘reputational rating,’ i.e., alphanumeric  indicators capable of measuring the reliability of individuals in the economic and  professional fields, with the goal to present the data subjects’ “credentials” to the  defendant’s customers. While the Associazione argued that individuals who adhered to  its platform and voluntarily uploaded documents therein were manifesting their consent  to the ADM involved, the Court concluded that such adherence does not also imply  the acceptance of an automated system that scores the individual who joins it based  on his or her personal data, if he or she is not aware of the ‘executive scheme’ (i.e., the  logic involved) and the constitutive elements of the algorithm.34 This case illustrates the  meaningful connection between Article 22 — in particular, paragraph (2)(c) — with the  GDPR’s transparency obligations. In addition to the exemptions set out in paragraph (2), paragraph (4) of Article 22 demands  controllers that use sensitive data in ADM processes to apply “suitable measures to safeguard  the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests.” However, data related to  protected characteristics which is covered by Article 9(1) GDPR may only be processed in such  a context if data subjects have given their prior explicit consent or there is a “substantial public  interest” involved. 1.5  Human intervention, the right to be heard and  contestability must be ensured for qualifying ADM Mirroring the safeguards that laws authorizing qualifying ADM must enshrine in order to  lawfully allow for qualifying ADM to take place, paragraph (3) of Article 22 GDPR stipulates  that organizations deploying ADM under the contract and consent permissible uses must  “implement suitable measures  to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and  legitimate interests.” The latter shall include, at least, the rights “to obtain human intervention on  the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.”  Furthermore, Recital 71 of the GDPR states that, “in any case, data subjects should have a right  to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment” (i.e., after the individual  requested human review). The EDPB guidance recommends controllers to adopt a number of  additional measures to the minimum required ones, such as regularly checking datasets for bias  and introducing procedures to prevent errors, inaccuracies and discrimination.35 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     13The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  Cases 3 and 6: qualifying ADM related to gig workers, unlawful due to lack of  appropriate safeguards In its above mentioned decision on Deliveroo, the Italian DPA found that the company  had failed to implement Article 22(3) suitable measures to protect its riders’ rights,  including systematically verifying the accuracy and correctness of its automated  rider-management decisions, as well the relevance of the data to the decision-making  process.36 The DPA’s findings closely resemble the ones that surfaced in an older decision  by the Garante , targeting another food delivery company, Foodinho. In this case, the DPA  ascertained that the company did not implement procedures (like setting up a dedicated  communication channel) allowing its riders to exercise the rights listed under Article 22(3)  GDPR. It also mandated Foodinho to properly verify the accuracy and relevance of the  data it used to assign slots to its riders, with a view to minimize the risk of errors and  distortions that could lead to the limitation of the slots assigned to each rider or to their de  facto exclusion from the platform.37 1.6  The rest of the GDPR applies to ADM and qualifying  ADM, regardless of Article 22 conditions It is important to note that both when the qualifying conditions for ADM in Article 22 are met  and where they are not met, the rest of the GDPR obligations apply to the processing of  personal data underpinning the ADM system. However, there are some specific provisions of  the Regulation which are particularly relevant for ADM, including when it falls within the scope  of Article 22. These include the definition of “profiling” in Article 4(4), the data processing  principles in Article 5, the legal grounds for processing in Article 6 (which are relevant for ADM  and profiling that are not covered by Article 2238), the rules on processing special categories  of data (such as biometric data) under Article 9, specific transparency and access requirements  regarding ADM under Articles 13 to 15, the right to object to legitimate interests-based profiling  in Article 21, the obligations to ensure data protection by design and by default in Article 25,  and the duty to carry out data protection impact assessments in certain cases in Article 35.  This section will outline some examples of cases where courts and DPAs have found  touchpoints among these GDPR provisions when deciding on ADM-related breaches or when  issuing related guidelines.  a. General data protection principles, including fairness, apply to all ADM Regardless of whether ADM and profiling practices fall under Article 22 or not, they must  comply with the key principles outlined in Article 5 GDPR. These relate to the amount  of personal data that may lawfully be processed to attain the intended purpose (data  minimization), the accuracy of input and output personal data and the fairness of the data  processing at stake, among others. 
14   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR Case 7: ADM used to grade students allegedly breached the principle of  fairness and data protection by design obligations The Norwegian DPA ( Datatilsynet ) provided some insight into how Article 5 principles,  Article 25 on data protection by design obligations and ADM interact, in its intention to  order the International Baccalaureate Office (IB) to correct student grades because of  unfair profiling, published in August 2020. Given the cancellation of exams during the  COVID-19 pandemic, the IB decided to consider students’ “school context” and “historical  data” in the grading. The DPA established that such consideration was unfair (i.e., it  breached the GDPR’s fairness principle) and led to inaccurate grading (i.e., in breach of  the GDPR’s accuracy principle). Notably, the DPA observed that such grading did not  reflect the students’ individual academic level, rather potentially leading to discrimination  based on the school they attended. The DPA also points to the fairness criteria identified  by the EDPB in its data protection by design & by default guidelines, stating that any  processing of data — including cases of profiling such as the one at stake — should be  non-discriminatory, ethical and transparent, and consider power and information (im) balances.39 In this regard, the DPA stated that the grading system did not correspond  to students’ reasonable expectations, who expected their grades to reflect their  demonstrable academic achievements, the work they had put in as well as the knowledge  and skills they had attained. Furthermore, the DPA noted that the logic behind the grading  (profiling) algorithm was not publicly known, and that the IB refused to further explain the  model to the DPA and to students. This, according to Datatilsynet , translated into a breach  of the GDPR’s transparency principle.40 We had the opportunity to follow up with the DPA on the status of the investigation. On that  occasion, the DPA’s representative clarified that the DPA had forwarded the facts and findings  to the ICO, while the UK’s Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) was  also investigating IB’s exam results.41 Almost in parallel, the ICO had another reckoning with  automated student grading, as it dealt with Ofqual’s widely-reported A-levels algorithm.42 Just  before the UK government decided to drop the use of the controversial algorithm, the ICO  released a statement, underlying the importance of processing students’ data in a transparent  and fair manner. It also pointed to the fact that “the GDPR places strict restrictions on  organizations making solely automated decisions that have a legal or similarly significant effect  on individuals.”43 Finally, the principles of data minimization and fairness also played a significant role in the  decision the Dutch DPA took to declare the SyRi algorithm unlawful, in one of the most  consequential cases against an automated decision-making system in the EU (we explore it in  detail below in Section 2.2 and Case 27). It is important to note that the principle of fairness in data protection law has been traditionally  one of the least explored by literature and case-law, often being conflated with the principles  of transparency. This situation is changing as fairness starts to play a role in data protection  enforcement, particularly in ADM cases. As the cases in this Report show, fairness is already  linked to non-discrimination, but the principle is generous enough to potentially include  imbalances of power and other dimensions that will be clarified as case-law evolves.
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     15The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  b. Personal data processing underlying ADM and profiling require a       lawful ground for processing As shown above, ADM which is covered by Article 22(1) GDPR may only be carried out in limited  circumstances, which are listed under its paragraph (2). On the other hand, any data processing  involved in ADM practices which are not covered by Article 22 — including profiling — must  have a lawful ground for processing as required by Article 6(1) and, should the processing  include special categories of data, an additional condition stemming from Article 9(2).44 This is  illustrated in several court and DPA decisions we have analyzed.  Case 8: e-screening applications for gun licenses to assess psychological state  can be grounded on a legal obligation — Article 6(1)(c) GDPR The Court of First Instance of The Hague was called upon to solve a dispute between  two associations (Royal Dutch Hunters Society and the Royal Dutch Shooting Sports  Association) and the Dutch State.45 The latter required gun license applicants to fill in a  special digital questionnaire (e-screener) that assessed their psychological state against  ten risk factors (e.g., impulsiveness, lack of empathy, egocentrism, suicidality, narcissistic  harm and extremism). Under Article 7(1)(c) of the Dutch Arms and Ammunition Act, a gun  license may not be granted by the Dutch State if there is a reason to fear that the applicant  cannot be entrusted with possession of a firearm. The plaintiffs claimed that the e-screener  breached the GDPR, as it lacked a proper legal basis and countervened the rules on ADM  under Article 22. In February 2020, the court decided that the ADM taking place was  not covered by Article 22, as decisions regarding gun license attribution were not solely  automated (for reasons that we will explore below in Section 2.1), and that the  e-screener  data processing was lawfully conducted under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR:  the processing was  considered strictly necessary for the controller’s compliance with its legal obligation to  adequately assess gun license applications. Case 4: Automated tax fraud risk assessments require a legal authorisation,   as per Article 6(1)(e) GDPR In the November 2021 ruling from the Slovak Constitutional Court, judges decided that  the constitutional interpretation of Slovak law “does not allow the [Tax Authority] to use  data from the e-kasa system for automated analytical assessment of entrepreneurs’ risk  profiles”  to detect instances of potential tax fraud committed by traders, on the basis of  the receipts that were stored in the e-kasa database.46 To reach this conclusion, the Court  stressed that the Tax Authority’s algorithm aided the Tax Authority’s employees to decide  whether additional investigatory steps should be taken in specific cases. It observed that  this form of “automated assessment” by the Tax Authority based on personal data needs  to be authorized by Slovak law — as it cannot be implemented in a discretionary manner  by the Authority — regardless of the concrete effects they have on data subjects.47 While it  seems clear that the Court does not consider these “automated assessments” to fall under  Article 22 GDPR, judges invoke Article 6(1)(e), (2), and (3) GDPR to stress that the Slovak  legislator should provide a clear legal basis and additional safeguards — such as the ones  mentioned in Chapter 1.4. b) above — given that the issue of automated processing for  exercising public authority is not fully harmonized within the EU.48
16   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR Case 9: Automated assessment of job seekers’ chances for employment found  unlawful by the DPA, but lawful by the Court in appeal In a December 2020 ruling, the Austrian Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) decided on  an appeal lodged by the Austrian Public Employment Service (AMS) against an Austrian  DPA (BSG) decision. The BSG’s initial investigation on the AMS’s job seekers’ potential  assessment algorithm (called “AMAS”) was triggered by a data subject’s complaint. AMAS  intends to calculate the probability of registered job seekers finding employment within  a certain period in the future, taking into account several factors, notably job seekers’  age group, gender, education, health conditions, caring duties, the performance of their  regional labor market and how long they have been registered with AMS. Based on the  calculated probability, job seekers are assigned into different jobseeker groups: one  corresponding to job seekers with high market opportunities, another with medium and  a last one with low opportunities. This system seeks to assist the AMS’ counselors in  assessing job seekers’ opportunities and ensuring a more efficient use of resources.  The DSB’s August 2020 decision considered that the described data processing was  unlawful, under Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1) and 9(2) of the GDPR, and prohibited AMS from  processing job seekers’ data with the help of the AMAS, with effect from January 1, 2021.  The AMS’s appeal against the DPA’s decision alleged that data processing through AMAS  was justified pursuant to public interest tasks assigned to AMS by law, under paragraphs  25(1), 29 and 31(5) of the Austrian Labor Market Service Act (AMSG). The court agreed  that the processing of job seekers’ data by AMS (including sensitive data) was justified  by public interest tasks assigned by law, under Articles 6(1)(e) and 9(2)(g) GDPR.  It also  noted, disagreeing with the BSG decision in this regard, that profiling (under Article 4(4)  GDPR) on the basis of the collected data is covered by what Paragraph 25(1) of the AMSG  mandates the AMS to pursue, as such paragraph expressly includes the data types that  AMAS processes about jobseekers.49  Cases 10, 11, 12 and 13: Processing biometric data for automated identification was  found unlawful because it lacked a legal ground for processing (Clearview AI Cases) The DPA from the German State of Hamburg (HmbBfDI) ruled that the processing of  biometric data collected and made available as a service by Clearview AI was unlawful,  given the lack of a valid legal basis for the processing of such data.  It observed that  Clearview AI processes data subjects’ biometric data (under Article 4(14) GDPR), as it  “uses a specially developed mathematical procedure to generate a unique hash value of  the data subject which enables identification.” The investigation and subsequent decision  were triggered by a data subject complaint, which was based on the fact that he had  not provided consent for the processing of his biometric data. The DPA determined that  Clearview AI, even though it does not have an establishment in the EU, was subject to  the GDPR by virtue of the monitoring of data subjects’ activity on the web (Article 3(2)(b)  GDPR), as it “does not offer a snapshot [of individuals], but evidently also archives sources  over a period of time.” Therefore, the DPA ordered Clearview AI to delete all of the  complainant’s personal data.50
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     17The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  Cases 10, 11, 12 and 13, continued In a similar fashion, the ICO has more recently announced its intention to fine Clearview  AI for just over £17 million, along with a “provisional notice to stop further processing of  the personal data of people in the UK and to delete it,” as the company failed “to have  a lawful reason for collecting the information,” and “to meet the higher data protection  standards required for biometric data.”51 The CNIL has also ordered Clearview AI to stop collecting facial images of persons in  France from the internet to feed the company’s database that trains its facial recognition  software, and to delete the previously collected images,  both within two months. This  was due to the unlawful nature of the processing at stake, given that there was no  appropriate legal basis under Articles 6(1) and 9(2) of the GDPR for the collection and use  of biometric data. In this respect, the CNIL notes that “the company has not obtained the  data subjects’ consent” and that the fact that the personal data at hand was publicly  accessible does not grant the controller a “general authorisation to re-use and further  process” it under the legitimate interests legal basis, given its “strong intrusiveness”  and lack of foreseeability and transparency for data subjects.  It is also important to  note that, to establish its competence over the processing operations carried out by  Clearview AI (which is based in the USA), the CNIL used the same criterion under Article  3(2)(b) GDPR as the HmbBfDI to determine the extraterritorial application of the GDPR,  combined with the fact that the controller did not have a lead DPA in the EU as per Article  56(1) GDPR, given its lack of “central administration or establishment with decision-making  powers as to its purposes and resources” in the Union.52  More recently, the Italian Garante reached similar conclusions and imposed similar  corrective measures in its decision to fine Clearview AI in a total of 20.000.000 EUR. The  DPA grounded its decision on the lack of a proper legal basis — as legitimate interests  did not qualify as such — as well as for failure to comply with transparency requirements  for biometric data processing and monitoring of persons in the Italian territory. In this  regard, the authority notes that: “The possible public nature of the images is not sufficient  to suggest that the persons concerned can reasonably expect them to be used for facial  recognition purposes, (...)” and “the very circumstance of the public nature of the images  does not automatically authorize Clearview to be able to legitimately reuse them in a free  way.” Furthermore, Clearview AI was found to be in breach of the purpose and storage  limitation principles, as it processed such data for purposes which were incompatible with  the original ones and did not define a storage period for them. Like the CNIL, the Garante  ordered the company to delete the illegally collected personal data and prohibited  it from further collecting and processing  information about Italian residents through  web scraping techniques and its facial recognition system. The Garante  also  ordered  the controller to designate a representative in the EU  to be addressed in addition to or  instead of the US-based controller, as the company did not have an establishment in the  EU but was subject to the GDPR via both Article 3(2) targeting criteria.53
18   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR c. General transparency requirements apply to ADM and profiling,        regardless of whether it is qualifying ADM or not Articles 5(1)(a), 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the GDPR establish principles of transparency and fairness,  as well as rules about notices to be given to individuals, the modalities in which they should be  given, as well as rules granting individuals the right to access their own data. These provisions  apply to all processing of personal data underlying ADM and profiling, regardless of whether it  is qualifying ADM or not,54 subject to the general exceptions for transparency obligations under  the GDPR.  With regard to the obligation of controllers to give notice under Articles 13 and 14, the EDPB  Guidelines on Profiling and ADM specify that when the processing of personal data is done for  the purposes of either profiling or ADM, “irrespective of whether it is caught by Article 22,” this  fact “must be made clear to the data subject,”55 as a consequence of both articles requiring  controllers to disclose what are the purposes of processing.56 The EDPB also recalls that,  according to Recital 60 of the GDPR, “giving information about profiling is part of the controller’s  transparency obligations under Article 5(1)(a).”57 In practice, some enforcers are applying these  rules to cover additional information than the mere existence of profiling and the categories of  personal data processed for it, such as details about “how” the profiles were created and the  practical consequences of their creation (see Case 16 below). In addition, there are two specific transparency obligations in Articles 13(2)(f) and 14(2)(g) GDPR  requiring controllers to disclose in their notices the fact that qualifying ADM and profiling  covered by Article 22 are taking place, both in cases where data is obtained directly from data  subjects and where data is obtained from third parties or publicly-available sources. On top  of this disclosure, “at least” where qualifying ADM and profiling happen, controllers must also  provide “meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the  envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.” By using this wording (“at  least”), the legislators seem to have envisioned situations where, voluntarily, controllers may  provide information also about the logic involved in ADM and profiling that do not fall under  Article 22.  The EDPB encourages58 controllers, as “good practice,” to provide meaningful information  about the logic involved, and explain the significance and envisaged consequences of ADM  and profiling even when these do not meet the Article 22 criteria.  As the EDPB highlights,  this is especially because Recital 60 of the GDPR asks that, taking into account the principles  of transparency and fairness, controllers should provide “any further information necessary to  ensure fair and transparent processing.”  The EDPB guidelines interpret the ADM specific transparency requirements for notices as  mandating controllers who process data as described in Article 22 to inform data subjects  about elements such as “the categories of data that have been or will be used in the profiling or  decision-making process; why these categories are considered pertinent; how any profile used  in the automated decision-making process is built, including any statistics used in the analysis;  why this profile is relevant to the automated decision-making process; and how it is used for a  decision concerning the data subject.”59 In addition to the specific notice requirements under Articles 13(2)(f) and 14(2)(g), the right of  access also includes transparency related to “at least” qualifying ADM, according to Article 15(1) (h) GDPR. As such, data subjects making a request to access their own personal data, have the  right to obtain information about the existence of qualifying ADM and at least in those cases, 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     19The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  information about the “logic involved” in ADM, “as well as the significance and the envisaged  consequences of such processing for the data subject.” A February 2022 request for a CJEU  preliminary ruling from the Vienna Regional Administrative Court (Austria) invited the CJEU to  shed light on the extent of information that controllers who carry out credit scoring through  profiling are required to give data subjects about the underlying logic.  Case 14 — Request for a CJEU preliminary ruling: what is “meaningful”  information about the logic involved in, the significance and consequences of  credit scoring? An individual in Austria was denied conclusion or extension of a mobile phone contract by  a mobile operator. This contract would have led to a monthly payment of only 10 EUR. The  operator’s refusal was grounded on the fact  that the individual had a low credit score. The  individual challenged the credit scoring that the company relied on before the Austrian  DPA, for not having received meaningful information from the controller about the logic  involved in the ADM underpinning the credit score. The Austrian DPA decided in favor of  the individual and ordered the company to disclose meaningful information about the logic  involved in reaching the credit score. The company challenged the DPA decision in Court.  With the case making its way into the Austrian Court system, the Vienna Regional  Administrative Court (Landesverwaltungsgericht Wien) asks the CJEU to clarify whether  explaining the “logic involved” to a data subject who has exercised their right of access  in relation to credit scoring entails providing information that enables the person to  understand the automated decision taken in the individual case,  including in particular the  disclosure of (i) the data subject’s processed personal data, (ii) the parts of the algorithm on  which profiling is based, and (iii) the relevant information on the profiling process, notably in  the form of a list of the most important factors considered in that context.  Furthermore, the referring court seeks to understand whether the controller can invoke  trade secret justifications to avoid the disclosure of essential information  that would  allow the data subject to exercise their rights to express their point of view and contest  an automated decision. According to the Vienna court, this information includes, among  others, the input data used for profiling, the parameters and variables used in the  profiling process, the mathematical formula used to calculate the rating, enumeration  and explanation of each profile category, and an explanation of why the individual was  assigned to a particular profile.  Interestingly, the court also asks whether the individual (whether directly or through a court  or DPA) also has a right to obtain other profiled data subjects’ information (even if only in a  pseudonymized format) to verify the accuracy  of the controller’s profiling process.60  The questions for a preliminary ruling specifically refer to the interpretation of Article  15(1)(h) GDPR and they presume that the processing at stake meets the conditions for  qualifying ADM under Article 22 GDPR.
20   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR Our analysis shows that when applying the GDPR to profiling and ADM, enforcers make a  relevant distinction. On the one hand, there are general transparency obligations  for all  processing of personal data, including that underlying profiling and ADM which is not covered  by Article 22. On the other, there are specific transparency obligations  under Articles 13(2)(f),  14(2)(g) and 15(1)(h), only for qualifying ADM subject to Article 22, requiring a more complex set of  information to be provided to data subjects (“meaningful information about the logic involved,”  “the significance and the envisaged consequences on the data subject”).   ›In most cases, even where profiling and ADM are not found to meet the Article 22  criteria, data subjects still obtain recourse against unlawful practices or obtain access  to their personal data underlying an automated decision, including profiling, under  the general transparency provisions.   ›However, there is some divergence about the level of detail and type of information  that needs to be given to data subjects in these cases  under general transparency  obligations, varying from only giving access to personal data insofar as they were  relied on as the basis for an ADM in such a way that accuracy and lawfulness of the  processing can be verified, to a priori  informing data subjects through the notice about  how their profiles were created and about the practical consequences of their creation  (i.e., about the decisions which were taken on that basis).   ›Applying a strict interpretation of the law, enforcers are reluctant to expand the  transparency obligations specific to qualifying ADM — Articles 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g) and 15(1)(h)  GDPR — also to profiling or ADM which do not meet the Article 22 criteria. However, one  recent case from the Austrian DPA takes this approach, indicating that the enforcement  landscape of profiling and ADM transparency could start to vary in a more significant way.  ›When enforcing the right of data subjects to obtain transparency about the “logic  involved” in qualifying ADM in specific cases, DPAs require individual explanation for  each data subject inquiring about it, and a meaningful and high-level explanation of  what led the ADM process to reach an impactful decision on the individual. The latter  involves listing the specific categories of personal data that were used and considered  crucial for the decision, or what circumstances always lead to negative decisions.  Mathematical explanations, access to algorithms, or detailed information about  computing systems are never considered in these cases.  
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     21The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  Case 15: Information about “the logic involved” is due where a bank relies on ADM  to decide on credit applications or to detect potential fraud or money laundering On March 28, 2022, the Swedish DPA (IMY) imposed on Klarna Bank AB a 7.500.000 SEK  fine (approximately 750.000 EUR) for several infringements of transparency requirements  under the GDPR. Among other findings, the regulator noted that, in a period between  March and June 2020, the controller did not provide meaningful information about the  rationale, meaning and foreseeable consequences of the qualifying ADM it carried out  for the purposes of deciding on credit applications it received from its customers and for  detecting potential cases of fraud or money laundering. In this context, the IMY stressed  that Klarna’s data protection notice “only indicate[d] that certain types of information  [were] used in connection with the automated decisions” (like contact, identification  and financial information), but it did not explain to customers which circumstances may  be decisive for a negative credit concession decision. The IMY considered that “the  requirement to provide meaningful information on the logic behind an automated credit  decision entails the indication of the categories of data that are crucial in the context of  an internal scoring model and the possible existence of circumstances that always lead  to a refusal decision.”  As this information was not included in Klarna’s notice, the IMY  established that the controller breached Articles 13(2)(f) and 14(2)(g) GDPR.61  Case 16: Creating commercial profiles of customers may not be qualifying ADM,  but still requires detailed information about the profiling involved In a decision62 from May 2021, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined an energy company (EDP  Comercializadora) 1.000.000 EUR for not complying with Article 13 GDPR, finding that,  among other issues, it did not sufficiently inform data subjects about the profiling it  engaged in for marketing purposes.  The DPA concluded that the company’s customers  did not receive adequate information about the processing of their personal data at the  point of data collection (e.g., when entering into a contract by phone or electronic means),  including about how their commercial profiles were created by the company and about what  the practical consequences of such creation were (i.e., about the decisions which are taken  on that basis). Although the DPA found that the company’s creation of customer profiles  to send personalized marketing communications did not amount to Article 22-covered  ADM, it still ruled that controllers that carried out profiling activities are required to  be transparent towards data subjects about their profiling practices  and how they can  exercise their right to object to such profiling, under Article 21. To reach this conclusion, the  DPA referred to the EDPB Profiling and ADM guidelines and relied on Recital 60 and on the  obligation to disclose the purposes of processing (under Article 13(1)(c)), including when the  purpose is profiling and even if the profiling is not covered by Article 22.63 In doing so, the  DPA rejected the submission of the company that the profiling was in fact associated with  the purpose of personalized marketing communications and showed that in the General  Terms submitted by the company, profiling was enumerated among the purposes for which  personal data is used.64 On a last note, the AEPD highlighted that it is possible to find, in any  given case, a breach of Article 13 GDPR transparency obligations, even where there is no  infringement of Article 22 and Article 6, as these such provisions are independent.65
22   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR Case 17: Ride-hailing drivers have the right to obtain access to their data underlying  a decision to terminate their accounts, even if only partly based on ADM In a First Instance case brought by several Uber drivers against the ride hailing company  before the District Court of Amsterdam for alleged automated termination of their  contracts for fraudulent acts, the plaintiffs argued that Uber had failed to comply with its  transparency obligations regarding ADM.66 They had explicitly requested the company  to make such information available, pursuant the specific  transparency requirements  for qualifying ADM under Articles 13, 14 and 15. While doing so, they also raised claims  under the general transparency obligations of the same Articles. Even if the Court found  that Articles 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g) and 15(1)(h) were not applicable to the case at hand because  Uber did not make fully automated decisions, covered by Article 22,  regarding the  deactivation of drivers’ accounts in the platform (i.e., the termination of the drivers’  agreements),67 the Court did extend access rights for two of the drivers involved in  the case to receive personal data “insofar as they formed the basis for the decision to  deactivate their accounts, in such a way that they are able to verify the accuracy and  lawfulness of the processing of their personal data.”68 In doing so, the Court rejected  the company’s submission that such access would provide the applicants “insight into  the fraud detection parameters that can be used to circumvent its anti-fraud system”,  considering that it was not sufficiently substantiated.69 The similar data access request  of the other drivers involved in the case was rejected by the Court, on the ground that  they had already been provided with sufficient information about the deactivation of their  accounts through individual messages and other interactions with the company.70
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     23The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  Case 18: Access to personal data used to draw up a profile of a ride-hailing  driver is not possible when the claim is not “sufficiently specified” In another case involving ride-hailing drivers and Uber,71 the District Court of Amsterdam,  as the First Instance Court, again made a distinction between transparency rights in  relation to qualifying ADM and transparency rights in relation to ADM and profiling which  do not fall under Article 22. First, the Court found that there was not enough evidence for  qualifying the automated process of matching drivers and clients for a ride as having legal  or similarly significant effect, therefore Article 15(1)(h) was not found applicable.72 Second,  the Court noted that, to the extent the applicants wish to have access to their personal  data that the company used to draw up a profile in the sense of Article 4(4) GDPR, the  applicants “have not sufficiently specified this request.”73 Per a contrario , this means that  if such a request related to profiling not covered by Article 22 was sufficiently specified,  the Court would have considered it. In their submission, the applicants also asked the  Court to issue an order against Uber to give them access to “all personal data relating  to them that it processes,” including personal data used to feed the passenger-drivers  matching algorithm.74 However, the Court rejected it on grounds that the applicants’  access request was too general (i.e. not sufficiently concrete on the types of data they  wished to access).75 The court only ordered Uber to grant plaintiffs access to their  anonymised individual ratings,76 and not to other pieces of information, such as each  driver’s “tags” determined by Uber employees to categorize the driver’s behavior.77 One  other request of interest made by the applicants was to have access to their personal data  underlying the “upfront pricing” system that the company uses to determine the price of  rides. While the Court found that “in general, it can be assumed that the application of a  system of tariff determination involves the processing of personal data if its purpose  is to make decisions in respect of one person,”78 it was not satisfied with the information  provided at the hearing that the applicants want access to these data “in order to verify  the accuracy and lawfulness of the processing.” Therefore, it rejected this request, but  without providing more details about its reasoning or specifically grounding it in one of the  restrictions of the right of access under the GDPR.79 
24   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR Case 19: Fraud probability score constitutes profiling, and ride-hailing drivers have  a right to access personal data underscoring it even if it is not qualifying ADM In March 2021, the Amsterdam District Court dealt with another case brought by drivers  against a ride hailing company, Ola,80 in First Instance. The plaintiffs requested Ola to  share information about the data it used for driver profiling and ADM purposes, including  data on their fraud probability score, earning profile, assigned rides and imposed  discounts and fines. Specifically on the fraud probability score, the court held that it  constituted profiling under Article 4(4) GDPR, since “the automated processing of personal  data of the applicants creates a risk profile that makes a prediction about their behavior  and reliability.”81 The Court also noted that it does appear automated decisions have been  taken on the basis of this personalized score, therefore this is not ADM covered by Article  22. However, Ola must provide access to the personal data of the applicants that it  used to draw up such a profile,  as well as information about the segments into which the  applicants have been classified.82 The Court was not satisfied that any of the restrictions  to the right of access in Article 15(4) were satisfied, arguing that Ola “has not made clear  to what extent providing access to the processed personal data offers applicants insight  into its working and enforcement policy and the system it uses for this purpose, which  would allow applicants to circumvent certain security measures.”83 Case 20: Qualifying ADM establishing social benefits requires disclosure of  information about the logic involved in the decision for every data subject  making an access request In a case where the facts satisfied the criteria of Article 22 for the ADM taking place, the  Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) observed that Udbetaling Danmark  — the authority responsible  for the collection, disbursement and control of a number of public benefits in Denmark  — failed to provide 5 data subjects who requested access to their personal data with  mandatory information on the existence of automated decisions on the concession of  certain benefits, in accordance with Article 15(1)(h) GDPR.84 According to the DPA, the  templates that Udbetaling Danmark  used to reply to access requests revealed that the  latter could carry out ADM in this context, including by screening information obtained from  public registers against information received from data subjects to automatically determine  whether the latter were entitled to the requested benefits which were income-based  (such as pensions and housing benefits). Therefore, the DPA concluded that Udbetaling  Danmark  should have informed data subjects who exercised their access right about such  ADM practices, by providing at least meaningful information on the ADM’s logic, as well  as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.   Udbetaling Danmark  eventually committed to changing the wording of its template answers,  to ensure that pursuant to each access request received, data subjects are informed about  whether automated decisions had been made specifically against them.
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     25The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  Case 21: Meaningful information should be provided about automatically  including an individual in a marketing segment, even if it is not covered by  Article 22  In a September 2020 decision,85 the Austrian DPA (BSG) held that the controller must  provide the data subject with meaningful information about the marketing scores  he had  been attributed by the former, as a consequence of the fact that it amounts to profiling,  even if it may not constitute qualifying ADM. Such scores consisted of alleged likelihoods  (expressed in a percentage number) that the subject would belong to certain demographic  groups, such as “conservatives,” “traditionalists,” “hedonists” or “digital individualists.”  As the data subject wanted to know how his marketing score had been calculated, and  as the company refused to provide such information on the ground that it would breach  trade secrecy, the individual submitted a complaint to the DPA. The authority held that the  marketing scores were considered personal data and that the processing activities leading  to the creation of such scores amounted to profiling under Article 4(4) GDPR. Moreover,  according to the DSB, the right under Article 15(1)(h) GDPR is not limited to cases of ADM  covered by Article 22 GDPR, but also encompasses other cases, such as the profiling at  hand:  the use of the words “at least in those cases” in Article 15(1)(h) points toward a broad  scope of application.86 Therefore, the DSB considered that it is not necessary to ascertain  whether the profiling qualifies as ADM under Article 22 or not. While the DPA agreed that  the respondent was not required to disclose the algorithm, the source code or compiler  code that was used when creating the marketing scores (as those would likely be qualified  as trade secrets), it still had to provide the following information in connection with the score  calculation: parameters or input variables and how they came about (e.g., using statistical  information); their effect on the score; explanation of why the data subject was assigned  a particular score; list of possible profile categories; or similar equivalent information that  enables the data subject to exercise his or her rights of rectification and erasure and to  review the lawfulness of processing.87  Thus, the Austrian DPA proposes a broad application of the specific transparency obligation  under the right of access tailored to “at least” cover qualifying ADM, to include profiling  which does not meet the qualifying ADM criteria. This is consequential, because only the  specific transparency obligations in Articles 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g) and 15(1)(h) require disclosure  of “meaningful information about the logic involved” in ADM or profiling, “as well as the  significance and the envisaged consequences” of such processing on the data subject. d. DPIAs are always required for qualifying ADM in some EU Member States  Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) are a key accountability measure required by  the GDPR whenever a type of processing of personal data is “likely to result in a high risk to  the rights and freedoms” of individuals, subject to the conditions detailed in Article 35.88 This  provision specifically refers to a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects based  on automated processing, including profiling, on which decisions are based that produce  legal or similarly significant effects on the individual, as requiring a DPIA under Article 35(3)(a).  However, Article 35(1) allows for additional processing operations underlying ADM and profiling  to be covered by the DPIA obligation, depending on whether they are high risk for the rights  and freedoms of individuals. 
26   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUMThe Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR In its profiling guidance, the EDPB stresses that Article 35(3)(a) GDPR “refers to evaluations  including profiling and decisions that are ‘based’ on automated processing, rather than ‘solely’  automated processing. We take this to mean that Article 35(3)(a) will apply in the case of  decision-making including profiling with legal or similarly significant effects that is not wholly  automated, as well as solely automated decision-making defined in Article 22(1).”89  A number of recent DPA decisions confirm this approach, by finding breaches of the GDPR  where controllers carrying out certain forms of profiling or ADM, including qualifying ADM, failed  to conduct a DPIA. Case 3: An algorithm that assigns shifts to platform workers based on certain  criteria requires a prior DPIA In its groundbreaking Deliveroo decision,90 the Garante determined that Deliveroo should  have conducted a DPIA on the Frank algorithm, taking into account Article 35(3)(a) GDPR  and criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the EDPB/WP29 DPIA Guidelines:91 the processing used  innovative technologies, it was large scale (both in terms of the number of riders — 8.000  — and the types of data used), it related to vulnerable individuals (gig economy workers),  and entailed an assessment or scoring of the latter. In this case, the Garante found that  the ADM at issue was covered by Article 22. Case 4: Tax Authority must conduct a DPIA before implementing automated tax  fraud risk assessments  The Slovak Constitutional Court ruling on the e-kasa system and tax fraud detection  algorithm states t hat “the e-kasa system is a type of processing using new technologies  which, given the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to lead to  a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This finding is all the more true if  the [Tax Authority] uses it for automated risk assessment of entrepreneurs and therefore  Article 35 GDPR provides one of the guarantees” for the protection of data subjects.92  It adds that, “As a rule, in the context of an automated assessment, a public authority  will be obliged to carry out a [DPIA] pursuant to Article 35 GDPR. However, unlike other  processing operations, the impact assessment must focus on the overall human rights  impact of automated systems on the individual,” as well as on identifying specific risks, (...)  [documenting] the scope of human and automated assessment in the different steps of  the data processing process, [as well as] how to test the “data-set” and models used.”93  Of note, the Constitutional Court did not make a specific finding related to whether  the automated processing at issue falls or not under Article 22 GDPR, since it primarily  interpreted and applied the constitutional right to informational self-determination in  the Slovak Constitution. It did note tangentially that the automated process used by  the Tax Authority does not make a decision per se and it only includes an automated  risk assessment, but it did not find this of consequence for the application of such  constitutional right.94 In a later paragraph, the Court does refer to Article 22 GDPR under  general remarks,95 without applying it to the facts of the case. 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     27The Fundamentals of Article 22 GDPR  It should be noted that there are some differences resulting from comparing the ADM covered  by Article 22(1) and the ADM that triggers the obligation to perform a DPIA referred to in  Article 35(3)(a).  Arguably, certain types of ADM covered by Article 22 are not subject to a prior  DPIA, for instance where they are based on an occasional evaluation of a limited number of  personal aspects relating to natural persons.  Furthermore, ADM with legal or similar significant effects is only one of nine criteria that  controllers should take into account according to the EDPB/WP29 guidance on DPIAs when  deciding if a processing is sufficiently high risk to require conducting a DPIA.96 Other criteria  described by the EDPB/WP29 in these Guidelines could also be relevant for identifying high risk  processing in other ADM, even if not covered by Article 22 — such as processing that in itself  prevents data subjects from exercising a right or using a service, like automated screening of  credit applicants, or matching or combining datasets in a way that would exceed the reasonable  expectations of the data subjects. According to the Guidelines, if at least two of the nine criteria  detailed in the Guidelines are met, controllers should most likely conduct a DPIA. However, the  EDPB also recognises that there may be situations where only one criterion suffices for the  DPIA to be mandated.97   In order to bring more legal certainty about this issue, European DPAs were empowered by the  GDPR to clarify what types of profiling and ADM practices they consider to fall under Article  35(1) GDPR, through the approval of specific lists of processing operations which always require  a DPIA. Some interesting examples include:   ›The Czech DPA’s mention of data processing that a data subject cannot influence, which  encompasses “processing operations which are performed by the controller (...) as a  result of automated decision-making,”98  ›The Finnish DPA’s reference to “Processing of personal data for automated decisionmaking with legal or similarly significant effects, where the notice exemption under  Article 14(5)(b) GDPR applies;”99 and  ›The Greek,100 Hungarian101 and Italian102 DPA lists, all of which deem to clarify that  ADM which falls under Article 22(1) always requires a prior DPIA under the Article 35(1)  general clause. 
28   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM  2. ASSESSING THE  THRESHOLD THAT  TRIGGERS ARTICLE 22:  CASE-LAW In order for Article 22 GDPR to be applicable, two conditions must be met at the same  time: first, the ADM at stake must involve “solely automated” processing of personal data;  and second, the ADM must either produce “legal effects” concerning the data subject, or  “similarly significantly” affecting the data subject. If at least one of the two conditions is not  met, then the processing does not fall under Article 22 GDPR and its specific requirements.  Courts and DPAs apply an increasingly sophisticated set of criteria when making these  assessments. In order for a decision to be considered “solely” automated, enforcers are looking  at the entire organizational environment where the processing takes place: organizational  structure, reporting lines and chain of approval; effective training of staff; internal policies and  procedures. Formal human involvement in making decisions is not considered sufficient, with  enforcers paying attention to the quality of human involvement, how it relates to individual and  actual decisions (as opposed to setting parameters at the outset for the whole ADM process),  and at what time in the decision-making process it occurs.  When assessing if ADM has legal or similarly significant effects, the criteria used are even more  complex, layered and considered in relation to one-another. Enforcers pay attention to everything  from the categories of personal data on the basis of which the automated decisions are produced  and whether they include data points and/or inferences about the behavior of data subjects, to  the capacity of a decision resulting from ADM to affect the “conduct and choices” of the persons  targeted, and to the more easily quantifiable financial loss or loss of income opportunity. Our research shows that even in those cases where Courts and DPAs decided that the ADM at  issue does not fall under Article 22 GDPR since it does not meet the required criteria, they have  still enforced other relevant provisions of the GDPR, such as the principles of transparency,  fairness, data minimization, purpose limitation, and other provisions.  2.1  “Solely automated processing” can sometimes  include human involvement The interpretation of the meaning of the “solely automated processing” element of Article 22(1)  GDPR is one of the most contentious issues in cases before EU Member-States’ courts and one  of the biggest focuses of DPA decisions relating to ADM. According to guidance from the EDPB/ WP29, not all forms of human involvement in a decision-making process rule out the application  of such provision, as mere token gestures taken by humans are not enough to set aside the  ADM prohibition.103 The condition that the decision-making must be “solely automated” in order  for the prohibition and special conditions in Article 22 to apply has already been assessed in  several cases, both by national Courts and DPAs. In the cases we analyzed, the Courts have  found that the decision-making is not solely automated primarily when:
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     29 Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law  ›organizational measures are put in place to ensure structured and substantial human  involvement, such as when multiple persons analyze automated individual potential  fraud flags and have to unanimously agree on whether fraud was committed taking into  account additional elements and correlating facts; or when   ›internal procedure requires a written assessment made by case officers on the basis  of an automated assessment, which then needs to be vetted by the head of the  organization; or when   ›employees are specifically trained and provided with detailed guidelines on additional  elements to take into account in order to make decisions on the basis of automated  assessments and recommendations.  As an outlier, a subjective criterion such as employees “using their own judgment” to act  upon automated recommendations was also considered in one case (by a DPA) to render the  decision-making as not solely automated. On another hand, the cases where enforcers have found that the ADM at issue was “solely”  automated involved outcomes based on an automated process which could not be influenced  by humans, or included inconsequential human involvement — as revealed by factors such as  lack of training about making decisions based on automated recommendations.   It is interesting to note that in all cases studied, with no exception, the enforcers assessed the  last stage of the decision-making process to conclude whether it was “solely” automated or  not. Moreover, in one of the cases, the DPA specifically found that the fact human staff manually  set out the algorithm’s parameters had no consequence on the nature of the decision to be  classified as “solely” automated. Most importantly, even in the cases where Article 22 ADM was not found to be applicable, the  DPAs or the Courts applied the other relevant GDPR provisions. Most of the time, breaches of  the GDPR were found, such as those related to lawful grounds for processing and those related  to general transparency requirements (see, for instance, cases 22 and 23 below, which also  resulted in significant million euro fines). Case 16: Deactivating the account of a ride hailing driver — not “solely”  automated when humans make the final decision after considering factors  other than the ADM signal In the Uber case concerning the deactivation of driver accounts, the District Court of  Amsterdam was satisfied that Uber had demonstrated it was not carrying out “solely  automated” decisions with regards to such deactivation. In that context, Uber showed  that its software was used to identify potentially fraudulent activities of its drivers. Such  a system merely generated signals for a specialized team of Uber employees (the EMEA  Operational Risk team) to initiate investigations of such activities. Uber’s protocols  required them to analyze these signals and the associated facts and circumstances to  confirm or dismiss the existence of fraud. Based on the investigation, two employees  from the Risk team needed to unanimously decide to deactivate the driver’s account on  grounds that there was a consistent pattern of fraud.104
30   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law Case 8: Granting a gun license is not “solely” automated when the negative  result of pre-screening does not automatically lead to rejecting the license  application Likewise, in the gun license applicants case, the District Court of The Hague found that  the decisions taken by the Dutch State to grant or refuse such licenses to applicants who  filled the legally-vetted e-screener were not solely automated in the meaning of Article  22(1). The court’s decision stresses that the weighting of the answers to the e-screener  is carried out by a computer program based on validated algorithms, which produces a  quick and efficient opinion that would otherwise have to be given by a psychologist or  psychiatrist. A negative result in the e-screener does not inevitably lead to a rejection of  the gun license application. The decision whether to grant the license or not is taken  by the Dutch Police’s chief constable,  based on the opinion formed on the suitability  of the person concerned, weighing all the information assessed. Such information  includes the results of the e-screener, but also a background check of the applicant  and applicant’s own representations. However, the application is rejected if there are no  clear contraindications that put the negative outcome of the e-screener into question.105 Case 9: Distributing benefits to jobseekers: not “solely” automated when social  security employees are trained and are provided guidance on additional factors  to take into account A similar view was taken by the Austrian BVwG in the already summarized job seekers’  potential assessment algorithm case. Therein, the court established that no solely  automated decisions under Article 22(1) were taken by AMS in relation to job seekers,  as the final decision on labor market potential opportunities — and thus the allocation  of funding — rests with the respective AMS counselor. In order to ensure that the result  calculated by the AMAS algorithm was not relied upon unquestioned by the counselors,  the AMS had published guidelines for action and had carried out training courses, both  of which instructed counselors to take AMAS’s results only as one of several information  sources. Criteria that cannot be taken into account by AMAS, such as motivation  and self-help potential of the jobseeker, addiction, debt, housing situation, etc., are  mentioned in the guidelines as decisive  for the final decision of the counselors, which  could lead them to diverge from the AMAS results. Counselors ultimately decide, together  with each jobseeker, on the optimal support strategy for the latter (e.g., through subsidies  and support services).106
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     31 Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law Cases 22 and 23: Client profiling is not qualifying ADM if employees take the  final decision on the best commercial approach in each case, but consent  should be informed and specific In January 2021, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) published a decision in which it found that  Caixabank’s client profiling practices did not amount to ADM under Article 22(1), as  the individual decisions taken on the basis of the profiling exercise (which included  price-tailoring and credit concession decisions) were taken by Caixabank’s employees  exercising their own judgment.  The AEPD reached this conclusion despite the fact  that Caixabank asked its customers to consent to such data processing, and that it told  them that they had the right to obtain human intervention, express their point of view  and contest the decisions taken by Caixabank on the basis of the profiling, as well as  to obtain an explanation of said decisions, all of which are typical of qualifying ADM.  Nonetheless, the AEPD still concluded that the controller breached its transparency  duties under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, and failed to secure a lawful ground for its  client profiling activities as per Article 6.  With regards to the former breach, the DPA  relies on Recital 60 GDPR and the fact that the controller failed to inform data subjects  about the types of profiles it intended to build, their specific uses and consequences, nor  about the individuals’ right to object. Concerning the latter, the AEPD established that the  data subject consent on which Caixabank relied for its client profiling activities was not  informed, free nor specific — and hence valid — given the DPA’s findings of transparency  shortcomings and since the consent was bundled to the contractual terms that clients  accepted when opening their accounts. This led the DPA to impose an administrative fine  against Caixabank, in a combined total of 6.000.000 EUR.107 In a separate case later that year, on September 22, the AEPD issued a 3.000.000 EUR  fine against Caixabank, after establishing that the consent on which the company relied to  profile prospects and customers for loan default risk analysis (both before and after credit  is granted) and personalized promotional activities was not sufficiently informed. Of note,  the DPA does not make any findings in relation to the applicability or lack thereof of Article  22 GDPR. The DPA noted that the information provided to data subjects in this regard was  generic, as it did not allow data subjects to understand the processing at stake — notably,  the profiles’ level of detail — and its consequences, such as the determination of an  individual loan amount ceiling. Moreover, the DPA found that data subjects were not given  the chance to separately consent to each of the profiling purposes, as required under  Article 4(11) GDPR, nor to the sharing of data with other Caixabank Group entities.108   
32   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law Case 24: Content moderation algorithm in a dating app is not qualifying ADM if  final decision is taken by a human  In the complaint that the NGO Rights International Spain filed against Grindr LLC with the  AEPD, there was a claim that the dating app’s content moderation algorithm produced  prohibited automated decisions that fell under Article 22 GDPR, as it could lead to  blocking user accounts where there were indications of illegal activities. Although the  controller admitted that it used an automated system to detect possible instances of fraud,  spam, or breaches of its Terms & Conditions, it successfully argued that the system merely  produced signals that Grindr employees analyzed before deciding whether to remove the  content at stake or block the user account. Therefore, in its January 17, 2022 decision, the  Spanish DPA found no breach of the GDPR in this regard.109  Danish DPA Opinion: Decisions on job offers that are merely supported by  automated analyses are not qualifying ADM The Danish DPA’s ( Datatilsynet ) July 2019 response to a parliamentary consultation on  the draft law related to active employment efforts presents clear similarities with the  AMAS court decision (see Case 9). The DPA’s assessment focused on the parts of the  bill that dealt with a nationwide digital clarification and dialogue tool that could be used  by job centers and unemployment funds. With the tool, a statistically-based analysis  could be made of the citizen’s risk of becoming long-term unemployed based on  information obtained from the citizen himself and information about the citizen collected  from the Ministry of Employment’s and other public authorities’ own records. In this  context, the DPA emphasized that the clarification tool should be used to support the  caseworkers’ professional assessment in order to improve the chances of offering  the right job, but that decisions would not be made solely on the basis of data  obtained from the tool.  It was against this background that the DPA considered that the  envisaged profiling would not fall within the scope of Article 22 GDPR.110 Instances of fully automated decision-making for the purposes of Article 22 GDPR have been  found in cases where either human staff had no possibility to influence the outcome of the  decision at issue, but also where the human involvement was not considered meaningful and  was seen as “rubber-stamping.” 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     33 Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law Case 25: Automated ranking of students leading to university admissions and  placement offers is qualifying ADM  In a pre-GDPR case, the French DPA (CNIL) found that admissions to French universities  were determined solely by the use of two computer algorithms: one automatically ranked  university applicants on the basis of three criteria (their place of residence, the order of  their wishes and their family situation); and another automatically directed an offer of  university admission solely on the basis of that ranking. Moreover, if there were several  applicants filling the same criteria for admission, exceeding the number of vacancies in  universities, the algorithm would randomly select the applicants who would receive the  offers. Human staff at universities had no possibility of influencing the final decision  regarding offers of admission delivered to applicants.  The CNIL established that the  ADM at stake breached the French national rules transposing Article 15(1) DPD and it  ordered universities to put in place an admission procedure which involved meaningful  human intervention, thereby allowing them to consider applicants’ observations.111 Case 6: Assigning income opportunities to platform workers on the basis of  their “score” is prohibited under Article 22 The Foodinho case offers another example. In that context, the Garante looked into the  automated data processing system used by Foodinho to assign riders to certain food and  product deliveries, on the basis of the riders’ “score.” Such score was set considering  factors such as customers’ and merchants’ feedback, as well as riders’ service requests  history (e.g., how many requests they had accepted and how fast they performed  deliveries). The DPA determined that such a system produced automated decisions  covered by Article 21(1) GDPR, which was not affected by the fact that the algorithm’s  parameters were manually set by Foodinho’s employees .112  Even in cases where there is a final decision taken by a human, the ADM process may still be  considered “solely” automated when the humans involved in the decision-making process  simply “rubber-stamp” an automated decision. 
34   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law Case 26: Student proctoring software — lack of clear human assessment  criteria leads to “rubber-stamping” algorithmic suggestions, thus the decision is  “solely” automated The lack of fully automated decisions was one of the grounds which a Portuguese  university that planned to deploy student proctoring software during the Covid-19  pandemic used to try to avoid corrective action from the Portuguese DPA (CNPD), in  May 2021. The controller sought to use Respondus Inc’s “Monitor” software to analyze  students’ behavior when taking exams (through the use of the students’ computer  webcam and video analytics technology, including facial and motion detection). The  software would have produced a report with an analysis of each students’ “performance,”  including by attributing a grade to each student corresponding to the likelihood that they  had committed a breach of the exams regulations.  In its decision, the CNPD found that the software tool processed the students’ “biometric  patterns” (by combining their use of mouse and keyboard with their body and facial  movements) to build each student’s profile through solely automated means, ultimately  attributing each of them a fraud likelihood score, which amounted to a breach of the  GDPR’s minimisation principle. Moreover, the CNPD expressed its views on the university’s  claims that the system did not produce fully automated decisions, as professors would  take the final decision on whether to investigate potential instances of fraud based on the  scores produced by the system and ultimately on whether to invalidate exams. It noted  that “ the absence of specific guidelines on the interpretation they should give those  scores and the lack of guiding criteria for teachers to take coherent and transparent  decisions may generate situations of discrimination and lead teachers to validate the  systems’ decisions as a rule. ” This seems to demonstrate that the CNPD does not believe  that human authority and competence on profiling-based decisions are enough to rule out  Article 22(1): the human decision-maker also needs to understand why they should follow  the automated system’s lead or not.113 It is important to note that there are also ADM cases that are assessed from the perspective of  other branches of law, most often labor law, and not only in the application of data protection  law. While such cases are not in the scope of our report, we did identify some of them during  our research. In these cases, national courts express reservations toward decisions that impact  individuals based on solely automated processes114 more often than not. 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     35 Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law 2.2  “Legal or similarly significant effects” require a   multi-dimensional, case-by-case analysis  In order for ADM to trigger the protection of Article 22 GDPR, it needs not only be “solely”  automated, as explained above, but also to have either a legal effect for the data subject, or a  similarly significant effect. Some useful examples can be found under Recital 71 GDPR and the  EDPB’s guidance (see Section 1.3 above). However, our analysis shows that a multi-dimensional  case-by-case analysis is required, with enforcers weighing together a wide variety of criteria,  such as:   ›the categories of personal data on the basis of which the automated decisions are  produced and whether they include data points and/or inferences about the behavior of  data subjects;   ›the immediate consequence the decisions have on data subjects;   ›the temporary or definitive effect of the decisions;   ›whether the decisions affect conduct or choices of the data subjects;   ›whether the decisions limit opportunity for income or are followed by a quantifiable  financial loss for data subjects;   ›whether the data subjects are able to demonstrate the impact of decisions on them are  not trivial where enforcers do not find the facts of the case sufficient to show a legal or  similarly significant effect. We also note that one of the most consequential adjudicated cases where ADM had broad  impactful effects on individuals is the SyRI judgment in the Netherlands (Case 27 below). In this  instance, neither the Court nor the DPA decisions relied on Article 22 GDPR to ultimately protect  the fundamental rights of individuals. While the Court directly found a breach of Article 8 of the  European Convention on Human Rights (the right to respect for private life) when applying GDPR  concepts like purpose limitation and data minimization, in a separate case on the same subject  matter, the Dutch DPA found a breach of the principles of lawfulness and transparency, as well  as a breach of the principle of fairness in the GDPR. Nonetheless, the “significant effects” on  individuals of the SyRi algorithm were documented and explored in these cases.  
36   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law Case 27: Automated fraud signals have a significant effect on the private life of  the targeted individual In February 2020, the District Court of The Hague delivered its seminal ruling on the  Dutch governments’ controversial System Risk Indication (SyRI) algorithm. SyRI was an  algorithmic fraud detection tool targeted at neighborhoods hosting poor or minority  groups in the Netherlands. The system built risk profiles of individuals to detect various  forms of fraud, including social benefits, allowances, and taxes fraud. The court found  that even if “the use of SyRI (...) as such is not aimed at legal effect — neither [under] civil,  nor administrative or criminal law — a risk report does have a significant effect on the  private life of the person to whom the report relates. ” This, among other findings (such  as the lack of transparency of the system), led the Court to rule that the scheme breached  Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to respect for private and  family life). However, the court left open “the question of whether the precise definition in  the GDPR of automated individual decision-making and [whether] (...) one or more of the  grounds for exception to its prohibition in the GDPR are met.”115 More recently, the Dutch DPA (AP) has sanctioned the Dutch Tax and Customs  Administration with a 2.750.000 EUR fine for the processing of the dual nationality  status of childcare benefits applicants in the SyRi system with a view to detect instances  where there was a likelihood of organised fraud, in a manner that the DPA considered  to be discriminatory profiling that was unlawful under Article 6(1) GDPR, and in breach of  the lawfulness and transparency principles under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. Specifically, the  DPA considered that “dual nationality” status was not necessary to be processed for  the performance of a task in the public interest by the Tax Authority, under Article 6(1) (e) GDPR, which also means that the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) was not  observed. The AP found that Dutch nationality was sufficient to be processed, considering  that it was the one triggering the potential benefits. In addition, the AP found that the  principle of fairness was not observed either. “In short, such processing can be regarded  as discriminatory and for that reason contrary to the principle of fairness within the  meaning of Article 5”. Significantly, the AP did not make any findings with regard to Article  22 GDPR in this case.116 Cases 17 and 18: Ride-hailing drivers did not demonstrate that the effects of  ADM impacting them were not trivial In both Uber cases which we have previously summarized, the Amsterdam District Court  did not find that the automated decisions made through algorithms regarding drivers —  respectively, the decision to preventively impede drivers from accessing their accounts  pursuant to a fraud signal until they reached out to the company, and the decision to  favorably match drivers with passengers according to the drivers’ location and existing  traffic conditions — had the sort of impactful, long term or lasting effects that Article  22(1) would require. In the second case, the court more precisely held that the plaintiffs  were unable to judicially demonstrate that the effects of not being matched with a  passenger because of the ADM system were not trivial,  but indeed sufficient to reach  the Article 22(1) significance threshold.117
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     37 Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law Case 19: Automated decisions to impose fines or fare deductions on gig  economy workers have the sort of impacts covered by Article 22  In the Ola case, the Amsterdam District Court established that the ride-hailing company’s  automated decisions to impose fare deductions and/or fines on its drivers on the  basis of the performance data it collects about them “ha[ve] effects that are important  enough to deserve attention and that significantly affect the conduct or choices of the  person concerned  as referred to in the [EDPB] Guidelines. Such a decision leads to a  penalty which affects the rights of [the applicants] under the agreement with Ola. ”118  It therefore decided that Ola was prohibited from taking such decisions. However, the  wording of the decision is not clear as to whether the court finds that Ola’s ADM had legal  or only similarly significant effects on its drivers (or, indeed, both types of effects). In the Uber (non-existent “Article 22 effects”) and Ola (existent “Article 22 effects”) cases the  same Court reached different conclusions with regard to the effects that the ADM at issue had  on data subjects. The various elements the Court took into account, in combination with one  another, were:   ›the type of personal data on the basis of which the automated decisions were produced  (in the Uber cases: factual data as location and traffic, which are not dependent on  driver behavior; fraud signals, which are dependent on driver behavior, requiring a  further assessment; in the Ola case: broader “performance data” related to the overall  and ongoing behavior of an individual as a gig worker);  ›the immediate consequence on data subjects (in the Uber cases: matching gigs/rides;  suspending access to the gig account until further verification; in the Ola case: imposing  fines and penalties);  ›the temporary or definitive effect of the decisions (Uber case: the accounts were  suspended temporarily before a further decision was reached; Ola case: a sanction was  imposed as a fine, which seemed definitive in nature);  ›whether the decisions affect conduct or choices of the data subjects (a specific impact  highlighted in the Ola case);  ›whether the data subjects are able to demonstrate that the impacts of decisions on  them are not trivial. However, the burden of proof seems to have been considered as  falling on the data subjects only as a second step, once the Court was not satisfied  by itself, based on the facts of the case, that the impact on individuals triggered the  application of Article 22. In the Ola case, the Court seems to have been satisfied by the  facts of the case that the impact of the decisions were covered by Article 22, without  mentioning the burden of proof.
38   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM Assessing the Threshold that Triggers Article 22: Case-Law Cases 3 and 6: Ranking algorithms have significant effects on workers if they  limit their chances of making income In July 2021, following an Italian court ruling (which is further analyzed below119), the  Garante sanctioned Deliveroo for GDPR breaches related to its rider ranking algorithm.  This algorithm automatically ranked and assigned riders to certain delivery slots based  on the riders’ manifested availability in critical time slots (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday  evening) and the riders’ reliability regarding their manifested availability (i.e., whether  riders actually participate or not in their booked shifts). In its June 2020 defense,  Deliveroo claimed that Article 22 GDPR did not apply to its booking system, “given  the absence of (even abstract) legal or similarly significant effects on the individuals.”  However, the DPA concluded that the company carried out profiling and ADM impacting  its riders, notably for (i) “reliability” and “willingness” assessments relating to the  acceptance of shifts during critical time slots, to exclude riders from shift choices (until  November 2, 2020); and for (ii) the assignment of orders within the booked shifts, through  an algorithmic system called “Frank.” The DPA held that such ADM produced a significant  effect on the riders, consisting of the possibility of allowing (or refusing) access to job  opportunities,  in certain pre-established time slots, and therefore offering (or denying) an  opportunity for income.120 The DPA’s view on the seriousness of the effects of the ADM  system on Deliveroo’s riders was equivalent to the one it took in an earlier decision that  looked into a similar system set up by Foodinho to manage its riders.121 While we have mentioned in Chapter 1.3.c) above that the EDPB took a nuanced view of  whether online behavioral advertising may qualify as Article 22-covered ADM, depending on  the nature of the advertising and profiling at stake, the Portuguese DPA has offered a specific  take on whether targeted political advertising qualifies as such. Portuguese DPA Guidelines: ADM-powered political advertising is covered by  the GDPR’s ADM prohibition The Portuguese DPA (CNPD) adopted political marketing guidelines in March 2019  addressing the issue of tailored political communications. In that context, the CNPD  stressed that, where messages (SMS, emails, etc.) by political parties to potential voters  are tailored or targeted through profiling or ADM, such activities may be covered by  Article 22 GDPR, as they may significantly affect citizens. This means that, according  to the DPA, such profiling or ADM requires the recipients’ prior explicit consent.  Furthermore, the CNPD mentions that the messages sent to potential voters should  include information about why they are receiving them.122 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     393. ADM AND THE GDPR   CASE-LAW IN SPECIFIC  SCENARIOS: WORKPLACE  — FACIAL RECOGNITION —  CREDIT SCORING  The following sections explore three specific scenarios where individuals tend to  challenge ADM systems more often: the workplace (managing employees, contractors,  hiring processes); Facial Recognition (automated facial recognition, both in the public  interest and for commercial purposes); and credit scoring. The cases summarized  show that the GDPR provides for protection of individuals against unlawful practices in these  scenarios, even where Article 22 is not applicable. In addition, each section briefly introduces  new legislative proposals introduced by the EU to tackle specifically each of these scenarios,  creating thus potential overlap which deserves further exploration.  3.1  ADM in the workplace often interacts with labor rights Courts often assess the lawfulness of profiling and ADM processes through other lenses than  data protection law. This is particularly evident in judicial proceedings which involve the use of  algorithmic tools by organizations to manage their workforce and individual service providers or  contractors. A significant body of case-law is emerging on the issue of ADM in the gig economy,  which often includes both GDPR enforcement and labor law considerations. Interestingly, it  is precisely the use of ADM systems to manage gig workers which is considered the relevant  argument by enforcers to qualify this situation as an employment relationship, and therefore a  “labor law” issue (see cases 3 and 29).  Case 28 (related to Case 3): Fairness of automated ranking depends on the  factors which are weighed in by the algorithm In December 2020, the Labor division of the Italian Bologna Court found that Deliveroo’s  reputational ranking algorithm “Frank,” which determined the order in which Deliveroo’s  riders would be called for a given service, was discriminatory and unlawful, after three  riders sued the company. The algorithm took into account riders’ absences, without  considering the reasons behind absenteeism (e.g., riders or their children could have  been sick that day). Riders which were not available for, or canceled a given service would  lose “points,” thus leading them to a less favorable position to be attributed services  in the future, which could eventually result in a quasi-ban from the platform. The Court  stressed that Deliveroo’s profiling system could and should have treated riders that did  not participate in booked services for trivial reasons differently from riders who did  so because of legitimate reasons (like strikes, sick leave, etc.).  The Court did not reach  any direct conclusions on whether “Frank” fell under the scope of Article 22 GDPR, as it  approached the case from an Italian labour and anti-discrimination law perspective.123
40   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM ADM and the GDPR Case-Law in Specific Scenarios: Workplace — Facial Recognition — Credit Scoring Cases 3 and 29: Algorithmic management of gig economy workers leads  to qualification of the relationship between platforms and gig workers as  “employment” The Italian DPA devotes a significant part of its Deliveroo decision explaining why the  company’s rider management algorithm breached Italian labor laws, including a new  law that protects gig workers in Italy. The decision states that “ the company carries out  the processing of personal data of the riders (...) in the context of an employment  relationship  concerning the transport of food or other goods from restaurants or other  partner merchants (...), through the use of a digital platform.” The Garante reaches this  conclusion after assessing several elements of the relationship that exists between  Deliveroo and its riders, such as the fact that the company determines the riders’  remuneration and supplies them with mandatory working tools (like the Deliveroo  app’s credentials), garments and work shifts (through the disputed algorithm). Given  the “employment” nature of this relationship, the Italian DPA stressed that Deliveroo  is required to comply with Italian labor law rules on the processing of its riders’ (i.e.  employees) personal data , regardless of the concrete qualification of such employment  relationship, pursuant to Section 114 of the Italian Privacy Law.124 This includes the  prohibition of excluding workers from digital platforms or reducing their job  opportunities on grounds that they refused to accept offered services.125 Therefore, and  because it established that Deliveroo’s rider management algorithm led to the exclusion  of certain riders from such opportunities, it found that the controller breached the GDPR’s  lawfulness principle (Article 5(1)(a)) and its employment-focused provision (Article 88).126 A similar view was taken by the Amsterdam District Court — in September 2021 —  regarding Uber’s drivers, which the Court qualified as the company’s employees under  Dutch labor laws. Among other grounds, the court found that Uber exercised its employer  powers and prerogatives through the algorithmic assignment of rides to drivers (according  to Uber-established rules and priorities), as well as the algorithmic determination of the  payment they obtain for each ride. The court’s decision also mentions the fact that drivers  who cancel previously accepted journeys may be automatically excluded (i.e., loggedoff) from Uber’s platform as an indication of the subordination to which Uber’s drivers are  subject, which the court notes is typical of employment relationships. Interestingly, the  Court notes that Uber’s algorithms have disciplining and instructive effects on drivers,  thereby allowing Uber to exercise its “modern employer authority.”127 These recent court rulings and DPA decisions may have been one of the factors that inspired the  European Commission to propose a new Directive to improve working conditions in platform  work across the EU.128 The EC’s Proposal states that “Algorithm-based technologies, including  automated monitoring and decision-making systems, have enabled the emergence and growth  of digital labor platforms”, and that “Persons performing platform work subject to algorithmic  management often lack information on how the algorithms work, which personal data are being  used and how their behavior affects decisions taken by automated systems.”129 Among other  groundbreaking rules, the draft text contains provisions on worker status reclassification and  the algorithmic management of platform workers.  The proposal includes provisions on added  transparency  towards workers regarding automated monitoring and decision-making systems  (e.g., grounds for decisions to restrict, suspend or terminate the platform worker’s account), to a  ban on processing personal data on the emotional or psychological state  of platform workers.130
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     41 ADM and the GDPR Case-Law in Specific Scenarios: Workplace — Facial Recognition — Credit Scoring Management of gig workers with the help of ADM is not the only issue that has gained attention  of regulators and enforcers. Automated screening of job applications is another point of  concern which has generated regulatory action. Saxon DPA note: An algorithm which automatically filters job applicants that  are selected for interviews counts as qualifying ADM In its 2019 Annual Report, the DPA from the German Free State of Saxony elaborated on  a job application assessment tool that the Saxon State Chancellery wished to deploy.  Applicants would be automatically assessed and ranked by a software according to  predetermined criteria (with differing and predetermined degrees of importance). The types  of personal data used for the assessment were the applicants’ names, addresses, contact  details, gender, severe disabilities (if any), certificates and work assessments. The evaluation  made by the tool would ultimately serve as the sole basis for deciding which applicants  would be invited to interviews.  Taking the above into account, the DPA concluded that  there was profiling and qualifying ADM involved, as the decisions taken lacked meaningful  human intervention and were liable to significantly affect applicants’ rights.  Moreover, the  DPA took the view that the system did not seem to comply with Article 22 requirements with  regards to the use of an exception to the ADM prohibition, under paragraph (2).131 3.2  Facial Recognition is broadly regulated by the GDPR,  beyond Article 22 There is a large trove of cases decided by EU courts and DPAs in the application of the GDPR,  involving either building Facial Recognition (FR) products, or the use of live FR technologies  in contexts as varied as recording attendance in schools and keeping former convicts from  entering a supermarket. Thus, it is not only the providers  of FR technologies that have been  subject to GDPR enforcement (see Cases 10, 11, 12 and 13 above) for the way they processed  personal data to build FR systems, but also the users  of such technologies. These cases mainly focus on the issue of lawfulness under the GDPR (Articles 6 and 9), as well  as on principles, such as accuracy and data minimisation (Article 5). Only some of them refer  specifically to Article 22.  Our research shows that the GDPR offers individuals meaningful safeguards against some uses  of FR, notably via its rules on lawfulness of processing personal data in conjunction with the  rules on processing sensitive data (such as biometrics), profiling and ADM. For instance, these  provisions have protected students in France, Sweden and Bulgaria from being subjected to  attendance checks or access permission on school grounds through automated FR.  One notable common feature of the cases we identified is the fact that enforcers considered  explicit consent as being the only lawful ground that can justify the use of live FR in most cases.  In all cases where controllers argued they relied on the consent of data subjects for the use of  live FR, enforcers found that the consent was invalid, primarily because it was not freely given.  In one case, where public interest was argued to justify the use of live FR, the Court rejected this  submission and required that any public interest that may justify the processing at issue must be  grounded on a specific law to be considered as a valid lawful ground (cases 32 and 33). 
42   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM ADM and the GDPR Case-Law in Specific Scenarios: Workplace — Facial Recognition — Credit Scoring In the one case identified where live FR was considered to be lawfully based on substantial  public interests, and thus not requiring explicit consent, the DPA requested specific safeguards  to be in place in order to consider the processing lawful: refraining to store images that fail to  generate a match with the database used, posting clear signage that automated FR checks are  being carried out, and deploying cutting-edge encryption (Case 34). Cases 30 and 31: Automated FR to monitor school attendance and control  access requires explicit and free consent under Article 9(2) GDPR A February 2020 ruling by the Marseille Administrative Court annulled a decision from the  Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (PACA) region of France to conduct two FR pilots at the entrance  of schools located in Nice and Marseille. The system would allow the schools’ staff to  either grant or refuse students access to the schools’ premises, depending on whether a  match in the student facial images database was detected or not.  While the case — which  was brought by two NGOs and a parents association — was pending, the CNIL expressed  concerns about the implementation of such a system, given the target audience (children)  and the sensitivity of the biometric data at stake.132 The Court’s decision to annul the pilots  was taken on grounds that the consent collected from high school students was not given  in a free, specific, informed and univocal way  (in line with Article 9(2)(a) GDPR), and that  less intrusive means were available to schools to control their students’ access to their  premises  (e.g., badge/ID card checks, coupled with CCTV).133 Likewise, in June 2021, the Stockholm Administrative Court upheld the decision of  the Swedish DPA (IMY) to impose a 200.000 SEK (roughly, 20.000 EUR) on the Upper  Secondary School of Skelleftea for unlawful use of automated FR to record students’  attendance at a test.134 Aligning with the IMY, and amongst other findings, the Court  stressed that there was an imbalance of power between the school and data subjects  (i.e., the pupils), which meant that the latter’s consent to the processing of their  biometric data could not be considered free and, hence, valid.  The court also held that  the school had the right to monitor students’ attendance, but not by collecting biometric  data, given its sensitive nature under Article 9 GDPR.135 Bulgarian DPA Opinion: The decision to prevent students from entering school  premises on the basis of automated FR and temperature checks amounts to  prohibited ADM The Bulgarian DPA (CPDP) took a similar position to its Swedish counterpart in an opinion  issued in 2020 upon a school’s request. The controller in this case wished to install an FR  and temperature measurement system at the school’s doorway and to deny entrance to its  premises to students and teachers who rejected being subject to such monitoring. Besides  noting that the only suitable legal basis for processing special categories of data (such as  biometric and health data) in this context would be consent, the DPA stressed that consent  in such a scenario would not be free. However, the CPDP went beyond the IMY, by holding  that decisions to impede data subjects from entering a school’s premises by using these  systems would not comply with Article 22 GDPR, and that access control therein should  be conducted without the processing of special categories of data.136 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     43 ADM and the GDPR Case-Law in Specific Scenarios: Workplace — Facial Recognition — Credit Scoring ADM and the GDPR Case-Law in Specific Scenarios: Workplace — Facial Recognition — Credit Scoring Cases 32 and 33: Using FR to keep convicted individuals away from a shop is  unlawful In a different context, the Court of Appeal of Barcelona ruled, in February 2021, that the  use of an automated FR system to prevent the entry of judicially banned persons into  a supermarket chain’s premises was unlawful. The background of the decision was the  following: two persons were sentenced to prison by the Criminal Court of Barcelona for  violent robbery in a Mercadona supermarket. They were also prohibited from entering the  supermarket for two years. Mercadona asked the court to allow it to use an automated FR  system to monitor their entrance to the supermarket and to stop them from accessing. They  added that relying on traditional means (i.e., instructing the security personnel to perform  the control) would be virtually impossible. In order to justify this, Mercadona invoked a  legitimate interest to ensure compliance with the judgment of the criminal court and a public  interest based on the Spanish Private Security Act.137 The criminal court rejected the petition,  a decision which Mercadona contested before the Court of Appeal. The latter, however,  dismissed the appellant’s arguments, as it concluded that the use of such FR systems in  the field of private security would imply the processing of biometric data aimed at uniquely  identifying a natural person, which is, in principle, prohibited under Article 9 GDPR. The  Court of Appeal added that any public interest justifying the processing of special  categories of data would have to be grounded on a specific law, which currently does not  exist in Spain.  Alternatively, the controller would have to rely on the data subjects’ consent  for the intended data processing which, in the given case, would not be free (since it would  always be made a precondition to enter the supermarket’s premises).138  Since then, on July 27, 2021, the Spanish DPA has imposed a 2.500.000 EUR fine against  Mercadona for its automated FR pilot in 48 of its supermarkets to detect the two banned  persons. In a preliminary opinion of early July, on whether controllers could rely on  automated FR technologies to comply with the Anti-Money-Laundering regime, the DPA  had stated that controllers cannot make consenting to the processing of biometric data a  condition for data subjects to access their services, and that there was no legal provision  in the Spanish legal order that otherwise allowed such processing.139 Later, in its decision  to fine Mercadona, the AEPD confirmed that Mercadona:  ›could not rely on the Article 9(2)(f) and (g) GDPR derogations for processing  shoppers’ biometric data through the automated FR system, as such processing  served Mercadona’s private interests only. In that respect, the DPA underlines that  the criminal court sentence did not specify the electronic means (e.g., live FR) that  Mercadona could use to ensure the convicted persons complied with the ruling;   ›did not adequately inform data subjects about the processing, notably about the  underlying logic of the automated FR system, thereby effectively barring data  subjects from exercising their rights;   ›failed to carry out a DPIA and to consult with the DPA prior to the processing;  ›did not implement appropriate measures to ensure data protection by design and  by default, which allowed Mercadona to collect its customers’ biometric data in a  remote, massive and indiscriminate fashion.140
44   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM ADM and the GDPR Case-Law in Specific Scenarios: Workplace — Facial Recognition — Credit Scoring Case 34: Monitoring attendance on a football stadium through automated  FR technology is allowed for substantial public interest reasons, as long as  adequate safeguards are implemented A position which seems to directly conflict  with the Mercadona court ruling and DPA  decision was taken by the Danish DPA ( Datatilsynet ), in May 2019. Back then, the regulator  allowed the Brondby I.F. football club to install an automated FR system in its stadium to  prevent the entrance of (about 50) banned spectators.141 The DPA took the view that the  processing of match attendants’ personal data through the automated FR system would  be allowed under Article 9(2)(g) GDPR, as it would be necessary and proportionate  to attain objectives of substantial public interest, notably to ensure the spectators’  security.  Nonetheless, the DPA establishes certain conditions that the controller needed  to observe before deploying the automated FR system, including not storing images that  fail to generate a match with the banned spectators’ database, posting clear signage that  automated FR checks are being carried out and deploying cutting-edge encryption.142 DPAs across the EU have expressed serious reservations about the use of live FR systems in  the law enforcement context.  Case 35 and Italian DPA Opinion: Using live FR systems for law enforcement  purposes lacks an appropriate legal basis In February 2021, the Swedish (IMY) DPA found that Clearview AI had been used by  the local police on a number of occasions. The DPA held that the Police had unlawfully  processed biometric data for facial recognition and failed to conduct a legally-mandatory  DPIA. Therefore, the DPA imposed an administrative fine of 2.500.000 SEK (approximately  250.000 EUR) on the Police Authority.143  Likewise, in March 2021, upon a request for an opinion by the Ministry of Interior, the  Italian DPA took the view that the mobile real-time automated FR system (Sari) that the  Ministry intended to roll-out for security purposes would be unlawful. Such a system would  compare recorded subjects with a predefined “watch-list” of 10.000 faces. The Garante  noted that the biometric data processing at stake would lack an appropriate legal basis  and that the system would lead to mass surveillance.144 Finally, it is of note that live Facial Recognition technologies are a focus of the AI Regulation  Proposal presented in April 2021 by the EC. Such systems would generally be qualified as  “remote biometric identification systems” under the Proposal, either leading (or intending to  lead) to real-time or post-identification of data subjects.145 Thus, it is essential to understand  how the relevant GDPR provisions and the AI Act provisions will overlap, in order to effectively  protect the fundamental rights of individuals and their communities. 
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     45 ADM and the GDPR Case-Law in Specific Scenarios: Workplace — Facial Recognition — Credit Scoring 3.3.  Credit Scoring is justified on “contractual  necessity” only if it relies on relevant information  Courts and DPAs in Europe have been active in assessing the lawfulness of automated credit  scoring practices under the data protection framework. This is illustrated by the questions  referred by the Vienna Regional Administrative Court to the CJEU that we outlined in the  introduction to Chapter 1.6.c, by the fine imposed by the Swedish DPA against Klarna for  transparency shortcomings (analyzed in the same Chapter as Case 14), and by the Spanish  DPA decisions against Caixabank in 2021 (Cases 22 and 23 above). Below we outline other  examples of rulings which provide insight into creditworthiness assessments that may be  considered profiling or qualifying ADM under the GDPR.  The key question in most of the cases analyzed is whether the credit scoring or the decisions to  provide credit that financial institutions make are qualifying ADM. There is no unitary practice,  with the CJEU currently considering questions for a preliminary ruling to clarify under what  conditions credit scoring is the type of ADM that falls under Article 22 GDPR.  Existing case-law indicates that relying on certain criteria, such as age, to automatically exclude  a credit application from being analyzed, is qualifying ADM and needs to comply with the  prohibition in Article 22 GDPR and its exceptions. Interestingly, in one case, the DPA decided  that for the contractual necessity exemption to be applicable, the personal data on the basis  of which the ADM process reaches a conclusion about the individual has to be relevant for  the purpose pursued (e.g. age should not be taken into account, but the applicant’s financial  situation should; see Case 37).  Case 36: Automated credit scoring is not qualifying ADM if a human ultimately  decides whether to grant a loan or not In anearly pre-GDPR ruling from 2014, the German Federal Court of Justice  (Bundesgerichtsoft ) stated that “credit-scoring only amounts to an automated individual  decision where the responsible body takes a decision with a legal consequence for the  person concerned or a decision that has a significant impact on the person concerned,  solely on the basis of a score result without further examination of the content. That is  not the case where the knowledge gained through automated data processing is only  the basis for a final decision still to be made by a human being. ”146 The court’s remarks  are similar to the ones made by the Spanish DPA in the Caixabank case, which we have  covered above as Case 22.147
46   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM ADM and the GDPR Case-Law in Specific Scenarios: Workplace — Facial Recognition — Credit Scoring Case 37: The use of certain factors in automated creditworthiness assessments  leading to the exclusion of credit applicants is prohibited ADM The Finnish DPA (Data Protection Ombudsman) assumed a different  view in April 2019,  when it ordered a financial credit company (Svea Ekonomi) to correct its data processing  practices related to creditworthiness assessments. In its decision, the DPA stated that  the use of an upper age limit as an automatically excluding factor from having a  credit application further analyzed was not acceptable,  as “the mere age of the credit  applicant does not describe their solvency, willingness to pay or ability to deal with their  commitments.” Such an automated decision would, according to the DPA, fall under  Article 22(1) GDPR. The Ombudsman added that, for such a decision to be justified under  paragraph (2)(a) — the contractual necessity exception — it would need to consider the  applicant’s financial position as well. Lastly, the DPA ordered the controller to provide  credit applicants with information on the logic involved in the ADM, its role in making the  decision as well as the automated decision’s consequences for the data subjects.148 Case 38: Credit scoring amounts — at least — to profiling that requires an  explanation to data subjects A September 2020 decision from the Icelandic DPA ( Persónuvernd ) stresses that data  processing in connection with the preparation of individual credit scores must be  considered to involve profiling under Article 4(4) GDPR,  as it relies on data subjects’  financial information to evaluate or predict their economic situation by attributing  certain creditworthiness ratings to them. The decision was triggered by a data subject  complaint against financial information agency Creditinfo Credit Ltd. (Creditinfo), where  the complainant claimed that Creditinfo failed to explain how his credit score had been  calculated pursuant to a data subject access request.  On the complainant’s access request, the DPA noted that the data subject had received  relevant information by email from Creditinfo on how it carried out creditworthiness  assessments, including an explanation of the factors that had downgraded the  complainant’s credit rating  — e.g., his recent entries in the default register and his  ownership relationship with a company which was on the default register, and directing  the complainant to Creditinfo’s website to obtain further information. Thus, it concluded  that Creditinfo complied with Article 15 GDPR when it provided the data subject with  information on how it prepared his credit score.149  More recently, a set of questions sent — and later withdrawn — by the Administrative Court  of Wiesbaden (Germany) to the CJEU reveals that the lower German courts may be willing to  diverge from the Bundesgerichtsoft ’s earlier take on the lawfulness of automated credit scoring  practices (see Case 36). The questions could have also provided an opportunity to the CJEU  to clarify the meaning behind many of the concepts laid down in Article 22(1) GDPR, but the  case has been removed from the Court’s register, as the referring court withdrew its request  for a preliminary ruling.150 Even if this case has been withdrawn by the referring Court, there  are still three ongoing preliminary ruling procedure cases referring to SCHUFA, including one  specifically on the interpretation of Article 22 GDPR.151
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     47 ADM and the GDPR Case-Law in Specific Scenarios: Workplace — Facial Recognition — Credit Scoring Case 39: Request for a CJEU preliminary ruling — Can an automated credit  score created by a credit reference agency which is later shared with third  parties be qualifying ADM? In this case, the Wiesbaden Court is called upon to assess the business model of  German credit reference agency SCHUFA — which is providing its clients (e.g. banks)  with information on the creditworthiness of consumers through so-called score values  — against GDPR provisions. The Court seems to take the preliminary view that the  upstream credit scoring automated process itself — and not merely the downstream  decisions taken on basis of such score (e.g., to automatically reject a loan application)  — goes beyond mere profiling, as it decisively influences subsequent decisions that  significantly affect data subjects.  Through the way it drafted the questions, it seemed  that the referring Court intended to obtain confirmation from the CJEU on whether credit  scoring can amount to an automated decision which is prohibited under Article 22 GDPR.  Policymakers are taking stock of the increasing use of AI systems to inform or take decisions  on credit concessions. In June 2021, the EC proposed an overhaul of its 2008 Consumer Credit  Directive, to equip the EU’s legal framework with tools to tackle new phenomena in the financial  sector, such as fully digital consumer creditworthiness assessments and personalized offers  powered by ADM and “non-traditional data.” The Proposal’s explanatory memorandum clarifies  that the new Directive “aims to address the concerns identified in the processing of personal  data that are specific to practices observed in the consumer credit market,” notably the ones  relating to data minimisation and lack of transparency.152  The EDPS has recently delivered an opinion on the EC’s Proposal, in which it makes several  recommendations to ensure a good alignment of its text with the GDPR’s general principles,  profiling and ADM provisions. It suggests the EU co-legislators exhaustively list the types of  personal data that may be used in consumer lending, which means going beyond merely  prohibiting the use of certain types (e.g. social media or health data). It also notes that Article  18(6) of the Proposal essentially mimics Article 22(3) GDPR, by granting consumers the  rights to an explanation, obtain human intervention, express their point of view and contest  automated creditworthiness assessments.  Finally, the Supervisor looks at how Article 13 would  force controllers to inform data subjects when they are presented with a personalized offer  that is based on profiling or ADM. In this respect, the EDPS worries that the provision “might  be seen as implicitly legitimating personalized processing in ways that exacerbate existing  information and power asymmetries between consumers and providers,” and recommends that  the final text requires the provision of “clear, meaningful and uniform information [to consumers]  about the logic and the parameters used to determine the price.”153
CONCLUSION In a decision issued in February 2022 and published the same week we were finalizing  this Report, the Hungarian DPA sanctioned a bank for unlawfully processing personal data  resulting from voice recordings through an AI system that promised emotion detection and  measurement for customers calling the bank, and prioritization of those cataloged as the  most upset and impatient customers for callbacks.154  The DPA found multiple breaches of the GDPR: the principles of lawfulness, transparency and  purpose limitation; notice obligations; the right to object; controller accountability obligations;  and data protection by design and by default. The case resulted in a fine of over 650.000 EUR  and an order to bring the processing of personal data into compliance within 60 days. The  DPA did not pursue an assessment under Article 22 GDPR, since it concluded early on in the  decision that “no direct decision-making is made” using the AI system. The outcome of the  processing at issue merely served as a basis for further actions by the bank or its employees.  However, this did not prevent the DPA from finding that the processing significantly breached  the GDPR. This case, involving a truly novel proposition of automated processing of personal data resulting  in emotion recognition and classification, confirms the main conclusion of our study based  on more than 70 decisions, opinions and guiding documents issued by Courts and DPAs:  the provisions of the GDPR cover ADM processes and systems in a comprehensive manner,  beyond the specific safeguards offered by Article 22 for processing of personal data resulting  in decisions solely based on automated processing and that have legal or similarly significant  effects on individuals. This is valid for AI systems involving the processing of personal data even  when they are not qualifying ADM, live Facial Recognition systems, algorithms that distribute  gigs in the sharing economy, automated tax fraud flags or automated assessments for issuing  gun licenses — only to give some examples.  Even if the threshold for automated processing to be classified as qualifying ADM is high,  Courts and DPAs have found multiple instances where Article 22 GDPR is applicable. In  doing so, they have been developing sophisticated criteria to assess the degree of human  involvement in ADM and to establish whether the impact of solely ADM on individuals is  significant enough to trigger the protection of Article 22. Without going into detail (see Sections  2.1. and 2.2.), we note elements such as the broad organizational context in which an automated  decision is being made, existence of training for the staff involved in the ADM process,  influencing of choices and behavior of concerned individuals, the categories of personal data  on the basis of which the ADM is being made and whether they draw on monitoring of behavior,  or affecting opportunities of making income. One of the most significant elements of the lawfulness of ADM, be it qualifying ADM or not,  remains the existence of an appropriate lawful ground for processing. For instance, the use of  live FR in schools was declared unlawful in several cases primarily because it did not have a  valid lawful ground for processing in place — consent was considered to be the only ground  that could justify the use of this technology to process personal data of students, and consent  was not considered to be freely given in any of the cases analyzed that related to students  and schools. On the contrary, relying on live FR to ensure safety on a football stadium was  considered lawful by a DPA even if it was not based on consent, but on substantial public  interest, and provided that a set of safeguards was also ensured. In other cases, the mere fact  that consent was not sufficiently informed made the qualifying ADM unlawful (see Case 5).  48   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM
Conclusion Transparency obligations are very often invoked and applied in relation to ADM cases.  Generally, enforcers make a distinction between general transparency obligations for all  processing of personal data, including that underlying profiling and ADM which is not covered  by Article 22, and specific transparency obligations under Articles 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g) and 15(1)(h) GDPR, only for qualifying ADM subject to Article 22, requiring a more complex set of  information to be provided to data subjects (“meaningful information about the logic involved,”  “the significance and the envisaged consequences on the data subject”). In this sense, a point  of divergence is emerging in practice, with some enforcers (mainly DPAs) starting to push for a  recognition of the right to obtain information about the logic involved in ADM not only in cases  of qualifying ADM, but in any profiling or other ADM instances.  It is clear that since 2018 Courts and DPAs have started to ramp up enforcement of data  protection law in ever more complex cases involving ADM and similar technologies. On top of  issuing fines, the DPAs are making full use of their powers to issue corrective measures, such  as ordering erasure of personal data or stopping certain processing activities.  A particular need emerging from analyzing these cases is for a concerted effort to better  understand how data protection law is applicable to ADM and technologies like AI, ML, FR  that rely on or result in (“process”) personal data. This would ensure that new legislative  intervention — such as the proposed AI Act, the Platform Workers’ Directive, the Consumer  Credit Directive — does not create an inflation of legal uncertainty, but only occurs where there  are clear lacunae.

AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE GDPR: PRACTICAL CASES FROM COURTS AND DPAS     551 By virtue of the very broad material scope of application of the GDPR. See the definitions of “personal data”  and that of “processing” in Article 4 of the GDPR. 2 For a tentative definition of AI and ML and associated concepts, see Brenda LEONG and Sara JORDAN, The  Spectrum of Artificial Intelligence , The Future of Privacy Forum, August 2021, available at FPF-AIEcosystem-Re port-FINAL-Digital.pdf . 3 Article 6 GDPR. 4 Article 5(1) GDPR. 5 Article 32 GDPR. 6 Article 25 GDPR. 7 Under Chapter III of the GDPR. The “data subject” is the person whose personal data is being processed. 8 Loi  n° 78-17 du 6 janvier 1978 relative à l’informatique, aux fichiers et aux libertés. Article 2 from the initial  version of the law stated that “ Aucune décision de justice impliquant une appréciation sur un comportement  humain ne peut avoir pour fondement un traitement automatisé d’informations donnant une définition du profil  ou de la personnalité de l’intéressé. Aucune décision administrative ou privée impliquant une appréciation sur  un comportement humain ne peut avoir pour seul fondement un traitement automatisé d’informations donnant  une définition du profil ou de la personnalité de l’intéressé. ”  9 Article 3 added that “ Toute personne a le droit de connaître et de contester les informations et les raisonne ments utilisés dans les traitements automatisés dont les résultats lui sont opposés. ” 10 “1. Member States shall grant the right to every person not to be subject to a decision which produces legal  effects concerning him or significantly affects him and which is based solely on automated processing of data  intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to him, such as his performance at work, creditworthi ness, reliability, conduct, etc.  2. Subject to the other Articles of this Directive, Member States shall provide that a person may be subjected to  a decision of the kind referred to in paragraph 1 if that decision:  “(a) is taken in the course of the entering into or performance of a contract, provided the request for the entering into  or the performance of the contract, lodged by the data subject, has been satisfied or that there are suitable mea sures to safeguard his legitimate interests, such as arrangements allowing him to put his point of view; or  (b) is authorized by a law which also lays down measures to safeguard the data subject’s legitimate interests.” 11 Cour de Cassation — Chambre criminelle, September 28, 1998, available at https://www.doctrine.fr/search?q= Cass.%20crim.,%2024%20sept.%201998,%20n%C2%B0%2097-81.748 .  12 Garante, Ordinanza ingiunzione nei confronti di C.S.

In this case, the complainant argued that his bank’s nuisance calls  related to debts from his consumer loan qualified as Article 22-covered ADM. Although the DPA found that the  individual failed to substantiate his claims, it held that, should the processing fall under Article 22, the com plainant should first exercise his right to object with the controller under said provision.

See De WetenschappelijkeRaad voor  het Regeringsbeleid (WRR), Big Data in Een Vrije En Veilige Samenleving , Amsterdam University Press, 2016.  There are borderline cases, such as those of “triage” automated systems that ultimately limit the scope of  choices that the final human decision-maker can make, to which Article 22(1) may not apply.

It is noteworthy that, in its prior decision on the case, the Austrian DPA  (BSG) had held that the counsellors’ intervention tended to rely solely on the AMAS’s results. It further noted  that actual consultation time between counsellors and job seekers — during which they were supposed to dis cuss the latter’s wishes/expectations, their previous CV and the causes of their unemployment — was normally  very short (around 10 minutes). This meant that, according to the BSG, counsellors were merely rubber-stamp ing AMAS’s conclusions and that their intervention was not meaningful enough for the decision-making to  escape Article 22 GDPR.  107 AEPD, Procedimiento  Nº: PS/00477/2019, available at https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00477-2019.pdf .  108 AEPD, Procedimiento  Nº: PS/00500/2020, available at https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00500-2020.pdf .  109 AEPD, Procedimiento  Nº: E/03624/2021, available at https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/e-03624-2021.pdf .  110 Datatilsynet, Supplerende høringssvar over forslag til lov om en aktiv beskæftigelsesindsats og forslag om  ændring  af lov om organisering og understøttelse af beskæftigelsesindsatsen mv., lov om aktiv socialpolitik,  lov om sygedagpenge, integrationsloven og forskellige andre love (konsekvenslovforslag) , July 5, 2019., avail able at https://www.datatilsynet.dk/media/7758/fornyet-udtalelse-til-star.pdf , p. 3, 6 and 7.  111 Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés, Décision 2017-053 du 30 août 2017, available at https:// www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000035647959/ .  112 Garante, note 37. 113 CNPD, Deliberação n.º 2021/622, May 11, 2021, available at https://www.cnpd.pt/umbraco/surface/cnpdDeci sion/download/121887 .

60   FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM141 According to the European Digital Rights (EDRi) NGO, the DPA authorisation procedure is specific to Denmark.  Under the Danish Data Protection Act, whenever private sector controllers wish to use the substantial public  interest Article 9(2) GDPR derogation to process special categories of data, they are required to seek a permit  from the DPA.

Later this year, the Finish DPA announced that it had also found that  the Finish National Police Board has also unlawfully processed biometric data of potential victims of child  sexual abuse through a trial use of Clearview AI’s automated FR technology. Therefore, the DPA ordered  the National Police Board to notify a data breach to data subjects whose identity was known, and to request  Clearview AI to remove police-transmitted data from its systems.
