Information  technology comes in many forms and implementations. We believe the basic principles of accessibility  for human input and devic e output  developed for computers, the World Wide Web, computer  applications, visual displays, and aural and tactile devices have wide applicability for innovative devices  in all forms.   This set of principles aims to promot e accessibility, usability, and digital inclusiveness. These principles  are a tool that designers, developers, and policy makers can use to assure that the promise of computing can be enjoyed to the maximum extent possible by all members of society.   Implement Accessibility and Usability fo r the Digital Age: Accessible and usable technologies extend  beyond web and mobile applications. Accessibility and usability for the digital age should support and encompass accessible ICT  in all its forms  and assistive technologies.    Build Accessibility in from the Beginning : Incorporating accessibility and usability from conception can  help reduce issues once technologies are deployed and affecting individuals ’ lives. This also avoids  difficult and costly retrofitting.   Promote Awarene ss and Clarity About Compliance: Improving accessibility of ICT can often be a  relatively inexpensive process. Educational resources aimed at improving awareness o f accessibility  requirements  can reduce resistance and increase compliance.   Encourage Tool and Software Development: Tool and software development make it easier for  developers and content providers to design accessible technologies . Improved tools for testing and  auditing accessibility might provide clearer feedback and assistance in improving ac cessibility, thus  simplifying the process of bringing ICT  into compliance.   Promote Innovation and Accessibility: Promoting innovative architectural technical solutions that encourage entities to get creative in the way they provide access can help foster a n affinity for and  commitment to accessibility and usability rather than dismissal.   Foster Digital Inclusiveness: A technology -centered society must consider that individuals may have a  range of accessibility concerns associated with mobility, vision, hearing, cognition, disabilities and  changes in abilities associated with aging. Current and emerging ICT and assistive technologies should consider all of these audience s and plan for appropriate accessibility.    Emphasize the Importance of Privacy and Sec urity : The ubiquity of ICT and assistive technologies  broaden s the scope and scale of their impact. Privacy and security are instrumental in ensuring robust  and reliable technologies for individuals with disabilities.
