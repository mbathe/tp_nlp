  1          IEEE Position Statement     Ethical Aspects of Autonomous   and Intelligent Systems     Approved by the   IEEE  Board of Directors  (24 June 2019 )      IEEE supports the inclusion of ethical considerations in the design and deployment of  autonomous and intelligent systems.   Autonomous and Intelligent systems (A/IS) are systems that are capable of adaption  and learning based on feedback and data from their environment. A/IS hold great  promise to  benefit society in applications domains as diverse as transportation, health  and social care, environmental preservation, enterprise productivity, communication  network optimization, power grid adaptation and management, agriculture,  manufacturing, and en tertainment. Recent success in machine learning, signal  processing, planning algorithms, digital sensing, embedded systems, cloud computing,  as well as voice, image and pattern analysis have greatly accelerated application of  A/IS. They hold great promise to benefit society, but they also present potential new  social, legal and ethical challenges, with corresponding new requirements to address  issues of systemic risk, diminishing trust, privacy challenges and issues of data  transparency, ownership and agenc y.   Therefore, there is a compelling need for developers and operators of A/IS systems to  maintain awareness of and employ consensus -based global best technical practices  and standards that recognize and align end -users’ and citizen’s values when building  and deploying A/IS.  To that end:      IEEE supports the development of technological communities, the development  and dissemination of research and development products, the promulgation of  technical best practices, the development of educational programs and  the  development of technical standards that can extend the capacity of A/IS  developers and operators to deploy the benefits of A/IS systems in a manner that  respects and acknowledges the ethical obligation to consider these systems in  their human and soci al context.    
2    IEEE supports efforts that encourage a global, inclusive and informed dialogue  between technological communities, policy makers, regulators, legal  professionals, ethicists, philosophers, economists, community representatives,  end users and other interested parties regarding best practices for the ethically  aligned design of A/IS.       IEEE endorses the principle that the design, development and implementation of  autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS) should be undertaken with  consideration for the societal consequences and safe operation of systems with  respect to:      Human Rights  A/IS should be developed and operated in a manner that  respects internationally recognized human rights.      Well-being  A/IS developers should consider impact on individual and societal  well-being as the central criterion in development.      Data Agency  A/IS develo pers should respect each individual’s ability to  maintain appropriate control over their personal data and identifying  information.      Effectiveness  Developers and operators should consider the effectiveness  and fitness of A/IS technologies for the purpose o f their systems.      Transparency  To the greatest extent feasible, the technical basis of the  particular decisions made by an A/IS should be discoverable.      Accountability  A/IS should be designed and operated in a manner that  permits production of an unambiguo us rationale for the decisions made by the  system.      Awareness of Misuse  Designers of A/IS creators should consider and guard  against potential misuses and operational risks      Competence  Designers of A/IS should specify and operators should possess  the know ledge and skill required for safe and effective operation.      IEEE supports  the consensus process of, and assets produced through, the  IEEE Global Initiative on Ethical Aspects of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems  and continues to engage  the broader IEEE co mmunity in work in this area  through efforts such as:      “Ethically Aligned Design – A Vision for Prioritizing Human Well -being with  Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, Edition 1.0,” produced by the IEEE  Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intellig ent Systems, is the  outcome of a three -year bottom up, globally sourced (with thousands of 
3   contributors), consensus -based project, using IEEE -SA rules, procedures,  and frameworks. In addition, it has gone through a very rigorous and  independent (of the ori ginal authors) review, including IEEE legal review, and  editing process.  IEEE SA's Board of Governors has expressed its  endorsement and support to this work of the IEEE Global Initiative through a  unanimous resolution.1     The IEEE P7000 Series of Standards2 that explicitly focus on societal and  ethical issues associated with a certain field of technology.      Technology efforts across IEEE Societies and Councils, including the IEEE  Computer Society, IEEE Computational Intelligence Society, IEEE Robotics  and Aut omation Society, IEEE Society on the Social Implications of  Technology and their associated Technical Conferences and Journals.      IEEE Tech Ethics program3, which seeks to ensure that ethical and societal  implications of technology become an integral part of the development  process by driving conversation and debate on these issues.      The IEEE Code of Ethics ( IEEE Policies Section 7.8) 4 is explicit in  referencing IEEE’s commitment to ethical design and to the societal  implications of intelligent systems, an d states in part:     o We, the members of the IEEE, in recognition of the importance of our  technologies in affecting the quality of life throughout the world, and in  accepting a personal obligation to our profession, its members, and the  communities we serve,  do hereby commit ourselves to the highest ethical  and professional conduct and agree:   o to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, to strive to  comply with ethical design and sustainable development practices, and to  disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the  environment;   o to improve the understanding by individuals and society of the capabilities  and societal implications of conventional and emerging technologies,  including intelligent systems.      IEEE is committed to developing trust in technologies through transparency, technical  community building, and partnership across regions and nations, as a service to  humanity. Measures that ensure that A/IS are developed and deployed with appropriate  ethic al consideration for human and societal values will enhance trust in these                                                              1 https://standards.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee -standards/standards/web/documents/ot her/ieee sa-bog-resolution -gieais -1218.pdf   2 https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/   3 https://techethics.ieee.org/   4 https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee -org/ieee/web/org/about/whatis/ieee -policies.pdf

In parallel with our commitment to the ethical aspects  of designing, developing and  deploying AI systems, IEEE supports the development of AI technology and its  application to advance the interests of society, and offers specific recommendations for  public policymakers in a separate IEEE Position Statement en titled Artificial Intelligence.   ABOUT IEEE   IEEE is the world’s largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing  technology for the benefit of humanity. Through its highly cited publications,  conferences, technology standards, and professi onal and educational activities, IEEE is  the trusted voice in a wide variety of areas ranging from aerospace systems, computers,  and telecommunications to biomedical engineering, electric power, and consumer  electronics.
