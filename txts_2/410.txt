© Ipsos -Global Opinions and Expectations about AI -January 2022These are the results of a 28 -country survey conducted by Ipsos on its Global  Advisor online platform. Ipsos interviewed a total of 19,504 adults aged 18 -74 in  the United States, Canada, Malaysia, South Africa, and Turkey, and 16 -74 in 23  other markets between November 19 and December 3, 2021.  The sample consists of approximately 1,000 individuals in each of Australia,  Brazil, Canada, China (mainland), France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan,  Spain, and the U.S., and 500 individuals in each of Argentina, Belgium, Chile,  Colombia, Hungary, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland,  Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, and Turkey. The samples in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Great  Britain, Hungary, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain,  Sweden, and the U.S. can be taken as representative of these countries’  general adult population under the age of 75. The samples in Brazil, Chile, China (mainland), Colombia, India, Malaysia,  Mexico, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey are more urban,  more educated, and/or more affluent than the general population. The survey  results for these countries should be viewed as reflecting the views of the more  “connected” segment of their population.The data is weighted so that each market’s sample composition best reflects the  demographic profile of the adult population according to the most recent census  data.  Where results do not sum to 100 or the ‘difference’ appears to be +/ -1 more/less  than the actual, this may be due to rounding, multiple responses or the  exclusion of don't knows or not stated responses. The precision of Ipsos online polls are calculated using a credibility interval with  a poll of 1,000 accurate to +/ -3.5 percentage points and of 500 accurate to +/ 4.8 percentage points. For more information on the Ipsos use of credibility  intervals, please visit the Ipsos website. The publication of these findings abides by local rules and regulations.METHODOLOGY
