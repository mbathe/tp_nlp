Advances in  computing and network capabilities bring substantial benefits in efficiency, convenience, and  perform ance for individuals, organizations, and society. Applications, services, and infrastructure  depend on the reliability and security of these systems.     What allows society to reap the benefits of computing and interconnectivity also opens the digital  ecosy stem to potential adverse consequences. These can result from unanticipated events and  interactions, or deliberate attacks, with consequences that range from inconvenient to devastating. The  significance of these consequences raises the stakes for the secu rity of computing and network systems.     The following set of principles is intended to elaborate essential qualities for secure computational  environments, based on sound scientific and technical foundations. While the complexity and rapid  evolution of co mputational environments – including infrastructures, devices, applications, and  information – will continue to present  new and unanticipated challenges, these broad principles provide  a strong basis for security.     1. Trustworthiness: Computing and network s ystems should be worthy of trust. Trustworthiness  entails the safety, security, reliability, dependability, performance, and survivability of the  system.    2. Integrity: Technical, physical, and administrative mechanisms should be available to protect  against  information manipulation that alters or masks the intended use.   3. Confidentiality: Technical, physical, and administrative mechanisms should be available to  safeguard access to and distribution of protected information. Access to protected information  shoul d be limited to authorized entities and users.   4. Availability: Technical, physical, and administrative mechanisms should be available to ensure  that information and resources are usable and accessible to authorized entities and users.   5. Manageability: Computi ng and network systems should be responsive to configuration and  patching by intended users without impacting functionality, safety, or security .  6. Transparency: Device, software, and service vendors are encouraged to disclose to their  consumers the informat ion needed to effectively manage personal, organizational, and societal  risks.    7. Accountability: Entities should be held accountable for the information they manage and  process and for providing appropriate security protections for that information.   
                               2  8. Holism : A layered approach to the ubiquitous computing and network infrastructure should  address systems architecture, hardware, operating systems, communications and application  software, and other components that comprise user environments.   9. Requirements based:  Establishment of an explicit statement of goals, derivative requirements,  and the processes needed to fulfill them is critical to security planning and operation. Ongoing  risk management programs that identify risks, and assess and respond to system vulne rabilities  using accepted and known frameworks and standards, are essential building blocks of secure  systems.
