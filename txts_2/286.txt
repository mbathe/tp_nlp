Person identification, human rights and ethical principles     I Executive s ummary  This study explores biometrics  in the era of artificial intelligence  (AI), focusing on the connections  between person identification, human rights and ethical principles. As such, it  covers a subject of  the greatest political and societal prominence. Among the many controversies in this area , certainly  one of the most salient is the discussion surrounding  facial recognition , and more specifically about  the potential risks stemming from the use of live facial recognition technolog y in public spaces.  The potential ly negative impact of the widespread use of such technolog y has indeed mobilised a  strong response from part s of civil society in Europe  and globally.   From a policy and legislative viewpoint, in the European Union (EU) this discussion is currently  being   framed in terms of regulating possible uses of remote biometric identification. Live facial  recognition technolog y uses facial templates that allow for the unique identification of individuals,  and thus constitute – due to such capability for ' unique iden tification ' – biometric data  for the  purposes of applicable EU data protection law.   For many  years , the exploration of possible  normative framework s to accompany and duly channel  the advent of AI has primarily turn ed around ethical considerations and princ iples . In 2020, however,  the European Commission started openly and decidedly mov ing towards the adoption of a new  legal framework for AI  as main priority in this regard . For this purpose, the European Commission   notably published in April 2021 a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the  Council laying down harmonised rules on AI (COM(2021) 206 final) (hereafter also ' the proposed AI  act' or 'the proposed AIA ').  The proposal puts forward rules that apply to a variety of AI systems . Demonstrating the importance  of biometric technologies, three types of AI systems , explicitly defined in the proposal and subject  to specific rules , are in fact defined in the very text of the proposal on the basis of their connection  with biometric  data : these are ' remote biometric identification systems ', 'emotion recognition  systems ' and 'biometric categorisation systems ':   remote biometric identification systems are defined as AI systems used 'for the  purpose of identifying natural persons at a distanc e through the comparison of a  person 's biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, and  without prior knowledge of the user of the AI system whether the person will be present  and can be identified ';   emotion recognition systems  are defined as  AI systems used 'for the purpose of  identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their  biometric data ', and    biometric categorisation systems  are defined as AI systems used 'for the purpose of  assigning natural persons to specific categories, such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour,  tattoos, ethnic origin or sexual or political orientation, on the basis of their biometric  data' .  These notions are  however  not yet fully consolidated at EU level, and thus one of the objectives of  the study is to unpack their rationale , scope  and possible limitations.   The proposed r egulation defines 'biometric data ' as 'personal data resulting from specific  technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or beha vioural characteristics of a natural  person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial  images or dactyloscopic data'  (COM(2021) 206 final 42). This definition of biometric data is exactly  the same as the one featured in the main instruments of EU data protection law, where the processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person is regarded as 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      II constituting the processing of a special category of data that deserves the most stringent level of  protection.   Scope  and structure of the study   This study has been prepar ed on the basis of desk  research . The focus of the study is the EU  framework, although due consideration has also been given to international developments when  releva nt. The study f irst provides  an overview of current trends in biometrics and AI, including  technological considerations and information about notable uses, as well as specific information in  relation to remote biometric identification, emotion recognition and biometric categorisation.  Second, it presents the regulatory framewor k, illustrating that ongoing developments in the area of  biometrics and AI do not occur in a legal vacuum, but amid pre -existing legal provisions and  overarching EU fundamental rights  obligations. Third, it reviews  current policy discussions, in  particular in the EU and as embodied by the European Commission' s proposal for a r egulation on  AI, and then puts forward policy options.   Biometrics and AI   Biometric data are increasingly used  in a great variety of contexts . At EU level, t he processing of  biometric data has been actively  encouraged and directly supported over the past years in the  context of EU -level large -scale information technology ( IT) systems in the area of freedom, security  and justice ( AFSJ ). These systems, initially set up by the EU for asylum and migration management  but increasingly also serving internal security, almost systematically rely on the massive collection of biometric data .  The review of  ongoing technol ogical and societal developments at the crossroads of biometrics and  AI shows that , although identification is a crucial notion for biometrics, there are many  developments aimed  not primarily at identification but at the categorisation  of individuals,  assigning them to different categories, for instance on the basis of age or gender.  It is however not  always clear how the processing occurring for the purposes of categorisation is linked to identification , or to what extent such practices can always be separ ated.   Most notably , it is sometimes unclear, first, whether the data processed  for categorisation purposes   concern an identified or identifiable person at all, and whether such data should thus  be regarded  as personal data for the purposes of EU law.  Secon d, it is sometimes unclear whether the data at  stake – which often relate to the body – constitu te or not biometric data, which requires taking  into account whether the data allow for the identification of the individual  (even if they are  processed for the purpose of categorisation). Complicating the situation further, sometimes the  categorisation of individuals is in practice a step taken towards their identification.   Regulatory framework  There is currently no European legislation relating exclusively to biometrics. The most directly  relevant specific rules of EU law are to be found in EU data protection law. In addition, the whole  existing EU fundamental rights architecture is fully applic able  to the use of biometric technologies .  A review  of this architecture and of the most relevant rules on biometrics and on automated  decision -making in EU data protection la w, as well as of the most important case law in this area  emanating from the Cour t of Justice of the EU (CJEU) and the European Court of Human Rights  (ECtHR) , shows that ongoing technological developments are taking place amid –  and possibly also  somehow despite – existing rights and principles , which might thus possibly need to be  reinforced, clarified, or at least fine -tuned.   Impact on fundamental rights   AI-enabled biometric technologies pose significant r isks to numerous fundamental rights , but also  to democracy itself . In this sense, for instance, the pervasive tracking of individuals in public 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      III spaces constitutes not only a major interference with their rights to respect for private life and to  the protection of personal data, but can also  impact negatively on their rights to freedom of  expression, and to freedom of assembly and association,  alter ing the way in which certain  individuals and groups are able to exercise social and political protest . The deployment of facial  recognition technologies during peaceful assemblies can discourage individuals from attending  them, limiting the potential of participatory democracy. Bias and discrimination are a well documented issue in this field, and can be the result of a variety of factors.   Different uses of biometric technologies can have different specific types  of impact on fundamental  right s. The deployment of remote biometric identification in public spaces, in this sense, is  particularly problematic as it potentially concerns the processing of individuals' data – without their  cooperation  or knowledge, on a m assive scale .  Regulatory trends  and discussions   There is an ongoing –  even if not fully systematic –  shift from the discussion of ethical frameworks  for AI to th e regulation  of AI systems by law. It appears nevertheless clear to many actors that an  improve d framework is needed to guarantee the fairness, transparency and accountability of AI  systems, an objective that can be pursued by enhancing representation at various levels of decision making.  Developments in the United States (US) are numerous and illustrate a variety of approaches, most  notably targeting facial recognition.  In Europe, the Council of Europe has been particularly active in  this area and is currently working on a possible new legal framework at its level for the development, design an d application of AI, based on  recognised  Council of Europe standards in the field of human  rights, democracy and the rule of law.  In 2021, there was  registered a European c itizens ' initiative   named 'Civil society initiative for a ban on biometric mass surv eillance practices ', calling for stric t  regulat ion of  the use of biometric technologies in order to avoid undue interference with  fundamental rights.   The European Commission published its p roposal for a regulation of the European Parliament  and of the Coun cil laying down harmonised rules on AI  (COM(2021) 206 final) on 21 April 2021.  The proposal is based on Articles 16 and 114 of the TFEU, on personal data protection and the  internal market, respectively.  The proposed AI r egulation prohibits the use of some AI systems (listed  in the proposed Article 5), and qualifies other AI systems as 'high -risk' , detailing the rules applicable  to such ' high -risk'  systems.   The area of biometric identification and categorisation of natural persons is in principle ' high  risk' , but under this heading (heading 1), only a concrete group of AI systems are mentioned: ' AI  systems intended to be used for the 'real- time'  and 'post ' remote biometric identification of natural  persons' . There is, however, no reference to biometric categ orisation being recognised as ' high risk' .  Potentially, it is possible to imagine there might exist AI systems that involve the processing of  biometric data  in all other areas listed as 'high risk' .  The AI r egulation proposed by the European Commission for esees, as a general principle, ' the  prohibition of the use of ' real -time ' remote biometric identification systems in publicly  accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement '. Nevertheless, such real -time remote  biometric identification systems can be  used  as far as such use is strictly necessary for certain  objectives and under certain conditions.   The proposed AI regulation explicitly excludes from its scope of application AI systems that are  components of existing and upcoming EU -wide large -scale IT systems , if the systems were  placed on the market or put into service during the first year of application of the r egulation, or  before that date. This rule would, however, not be applicable if the legal acts establishing such EUwide large -scale IT system s would lead ' to a significant change in the design or intended purpose of 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      IV the AI system or AI systems concerned ' (proposed Article 83(1) AIA). The proposed text notes,  despite the proposed r egulation not being applicable as such to the systems  mentioned , that the  requirements that it lays down must 'be taken into account, where applicable ' in the evaluation of  these large- scale IT systems as provided for in those respective acts (idem), but it is unclear what  such 'taking into account'  would imply.   Policy options   In light of the findings of the study, the following policy options are put forward:    Delimit better  the regulation of biometrics  and biometric data : the proposed AIA  reproduces the definition of ' biometric data ' present in EU data protection law si nce  2016. The interpretation of the definition is not completely clear, and there are  significant uncertainties as to how to apply EU data protection rules to biometric data.  The definition, in any cas e, does not appear to cover all the problematic practices that  are often framed in the literature and even by policy -makers as related to biometrics. It  is thus important to shed further light on the scope and relevance of the definition, but  also to think critically about the impact of conditioning some other notions put forward in the AIA (such as 'biometric categorisation'  or 'emotion recogniti on') to the processing  of biometric data defined in such a way.      Improve the future qualification of new AI systems as high -risk:  it is necessary to  envisage a faster, clearer and accessible path to qualifying  additional AI systems as high risk systems in the future. Civil society organisations could be given a role to raise the  alarm of major risks, especially insofar as the affected persons would potentially be  in  vulnerable positions.      Explicitly ban certain uses of live facial recognition : the proposed AI r egulation fails  to prohibit real -time remote biometric identification in public spaces for law  enforcement purposes, despite conceding that it triggers even  more risks than ' high risk'  AI systems. The r egulation should at least formally and effectively  ban the  persistent tracking of individuals in public spaces by means of remote biometric  identification, as it has major consequences for fundamental rights and democracy.      Regulate 'post ' remote biometric identification in the same manner as 'real -time '  remote biometric identification: the proposed AI regulation fails to address properly  the risks connected with the retroactive identification,  using  facial recognition , of  individuals whose images have been recorded while they were in public spaces . In  practice, the risk of persistent tracking and its associated adverse impact on  fundamental rights and democracy are, however, at least equivalent to the risk  associated with 'real- time ' remote biometric identification. 'Post ' remote biometric  identification of natural persons recorded while in public spaces should  be subject to  the same rules  as the ' real-time'  equivalent.      Establish at EU level the necessary safeguards for real -time remote biometric  identification:  the proposed AI r egulation leaves it up to the Member States to define,  by law the exact conditions for the use of in principle prohibited but actually permitted  real- time remote biometric  identification in public spaces for law enforcement  purposes. The only detailed condition is the need for prior authorisation granted by a  judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority. Substantive  safeguards for the prohibited but exceptionally permitted uses of real -time remote  biometric identification, if any, must be specified at EU level in the future AIA itself, as  opposed to being left to the discretion of the Member States.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      V    Ban AI systems assigning to categories that constitute sensitive data based on  biometric data : the proposed AI regulation gives a definition of ' biometric  categorisation system'  that is unclear and conceptually problematic, most notably to  the extent that it seems to endorse the idea that it is possible –  scientifically, ethically  and legally – to use AI systems to assign natural persons to a sexual or a political  orientation. If a reference to the use of similar AI systems persists in the draft, it should   be phrased clearly as a prohibition.      Clarify the r egulation of ' emotion recognition' : the status of ' emotion recognition'  in  the proposal for a r egulation on AI is not entirely clear. The proposed definition of  emotion recognition seems to imply that emotions and intentions of individuals can be  inferred from biometric data. This would only possibly make sense if biometric data are  understood in a broad sense, not limited to data concerned with the unique  identification of individuals. In addition, the list of high- risk systems in Annex III includes  variou s references to systems used ' to detect the emotional state of a natural person' ,  without clarifying if these would correspond to what is defined as ' emotion recognition'   systems or would potentially be something else.      Increase transparency towards individuals as a necessary means to guarantee  rights and remedies: the proposed AI r egulation privileges imposing obligations on  actors other than the users of AI systems, who are only subject to a limited number of  provisions. The use of extremely high- risk sys tems in particular should be conditioned  to additional obligations imposed on users towards individuals, notably in terms of  transparency both prior to the use and during the use. Transparency is crucial for the  exercise of rights and the effectiveness of remedies. Limitations to transparency should   be compensated with measures that guarantee the accountability of such limitations.      Do not allow for special exemptions to general rules for EU large-scale databases:   the use of biometrics and AI in EU large- scale IT systems is massive, raising serious risks  for fundamental rights. The fact that the European Commission's proposal for a regulation on AI deliberately leaves out of  its scope of application certain AI systems to  be used in the AFSJ is of great concern. It is essential that large- scale IT systems in the  AFSJ comply fully with the highest standards of EU law.

Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      1 1. Introduction   This study explores biometrics  in the era of artificial intelligence  (AI), focusing on the connections  between person identification, human rights and ethical principles. As such, it covers a subject of  the greatest political and societal prominence. Our societies are nowadays indeed at a crucial  moment in grappling with the impact on fundamental rights of the continuously increasing and  evolving uses of AI. These are occurring not only due to technological progress, but also in  conjunction with an equally increasing institutional support of AI technologies, typi cally  accompanied by narratives that highlight AI 's potential for societal advances and for economic  growth.   Among all the controversies that have surfaced in these debates, certainly one of the most salient is  the discussion about facial recognition (FRA 2020(b) 130), and more specifically about the use of live  facial recognition technologies in public spaces. The potential negative impact of a widespread use of such technologies has indeed strongly mobilised part of civil society globally, and also specif ically  in Europe (cf. for instance EDRi 2020(a)). From a policy and legislative viewpoint, in the European  Union (EU) this discussion is currently framed in terms of regulating possible uses of remote  biometric identification – as live facial recognition t echnologies use facial templates that allow for  the identification of individuals, and thus constitute, for the purposes of applicable EU data  protection law, biometric data .  After many years of explorations of the normative framework possibly needed to pr operly  accompany AI, which was until very recently primarily turning around ethical considerations  and  principles , the European Commission started openly moving in 2020 towards the adoption of a new  legal framework for AI. To this purpose, it notably publi shed in April 2021 a proposal for a r egulation  of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on AI (COM(2021) 206  final)  (hereafter also 'the proposed AI Act ' or 'the proposed AIA '). The initiative is extremely  important for the future of AI regulation and thus  for the future of  AI in Europe, but also potentially  globally. Th e global significance of the proposal was already perceptible in some of the earliest   reactions following its publication  (cf. for instance Haeck 2021).   It has been noted that, in this important initiative, ' biometrics technologies feature heavily ' (Kind  2021). Indeed, although the proposal puts forward rules that apply to a variety of AI systems, the  three types of AI systems that are explicitly defined and subject to specific rules are in fact defined  in the text of the proposal on the basis of their connection with biometrics : these are 'remote  biometric identification systems ', 'emotion recognition systems ', and 'biometric  categorisation systems '. The  AI systems  that are targeted through these three notions  certainly   raise particularly serious questions in relation to their impact on fundamental rights.   This study takes the three mentioned types of AI systems as  a guiding thread for the exploration of  the impact of biometrics and AI on fundamental rights , in order to facilitate a reflection on the  possible policy options curr ently available , and about the opportunities they each offer.  This does  not mean, however, that the distinctions between the proposed types systems are always fully clear,  or even that their exact relation with biometrics is not unproblematic. As a matter of fact,  questioning the pertinence and possible limitations of the proposed categories  and their definitions  is also one of the objectives of the study.  All in all, the study 's ambition is to throw light on the  evolution of the intersections between AI and biometrics, highlighting some of issues that most  urgently require attention from a human rights and ethical perspective.     
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      2 2. Methodology and resources   This section describes the scope of the study, including some key terminological considerations,  presents the methodology followed, and explains the use of resources.   2.1. Scope of the study   The study focuses on current developments that, building on the use of biometrics  and AI, present  specific challenges related to human rights and ethical principles. Facial recognition is arguably  the most paradigmatic development in this area, developing precisely at the crossroads of AI and  biometrics. Not all uses of facial recognition, however, trigger  the same type of legal and ethical  challenges. In this sense, f or instance, the impact of using facial recognition for authentication of  users of certain devices based on the consent of the individuals concerned is not comparable to the impact of facial recognition being deployed in public spaces, particularly for ide ntification purposes.  More generally, there can be many uses of biometric data which do have important fundamental  rights implications, 1 for example in relation to identity management, but these fundamental rights  implications might not be implications dir ectly connected to the use of AI.   A few terminological considerations are necessary. The term AI itself can be interpreted differently  by different actors. In relation to ' biometrics ', terms such as biometric systems, biometric  technologies , and biometric recognition are commonly used to cover the range of automated  technologies that use biometric identifiers to identify, verify, or confirm a person' s identity. To think  about biometrics nowadays nevertheless requires to also consider  systems that produce ot her  kinds of inferences from bodily data ( Kak 2020 6), also in ways which technically might not fall  under the most commonly used definitions of ' biometrics '.   To delimit in practice the scope of the study, and in light of its final objective, which is to put forward  pertinent policy recommendations at EU level, have been taken into account as main references the  definitions put forward in the European Commission' s proposal for a r egulation on AI, in particular  those related to AI systems and more specifica lly to AI systems and biometrics.   The European Commission' s proposed r egulation on AI defines ' AI systems ' as software  that can,  for a given set of human- defined objectives, generate outputs  such as content, predictions,  recommendations, or decisions influ encing the environments they interact with, and that is  developed with one or more of the following techniques and approaches (COM(2021) 206 final  39):  '(a) machine learning  approaches, including supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement  learning, using a wide variety of methods including deep learning;   (b) logic - and knowledge -based approaches , including knowledge representation, inductive  (logic) programming, knowledge bas es, inference and deductive engines, (symbolic) reasoning  and expert systems;   (c) statistical approaches , Bayesian estimation, search and optimization methods. '  These techniques and approaches are listed in an Annex accompanying the proposal, Annex  I. In  line with the proposed text, the European Commission would be empowered under the future  regulation  on AI  to adopt delegated acts amend ing the techniques and approaches  listed , 'in order  to update that list to market and technological developments on the ba sis of characteristics that are  similar to the techniques and approaches listed therein'  (COM(2021) 206 final  43).                                                                  1 See notably , for instance : Privacy International 2017.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      3 The European Commission' s proposed regulation  defines 'biometric data ' as 'personal data  resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural  characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that  natural person , such as facial images or dactyloscopic data'  (COM(2021) 206 final 42).   This definition  of biometri c data is exactly the same as the one featured in the main instruments of  EU data protection law; the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)2 (cf. Article 4(14) GDPR), the  Law Enforcement Directive (LED) on Data Protection3 (cf. Article 3(13) LED), and the Regulation on  Data Protection for EU institutions and bodies4 (cf. Article 3(18) EU DP Regulation).   The integration of this definition of biometric data in EU data protection law is relatively recent, and  its interpretation is not deprived of complexity. A Recital in the GDPR stresses that shall only be  regarded as biometric data for the purposes of EU data protection law the personal  data that  permit  the unique  identification or authentication of an individual through a specific technical means ,  noting  that:   'the processing of photographs should not systematically be considered to be processing of  special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only  when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or  authentication of a natural person'  (Recital (51) GDPR).5  It is very important to already highlight that at least in some contexts the term ' biometric data ' is  used, at least by certain actors, also in a broader sense, which does  not necessarily involve a llowing  a possible unique identification. Policy documents sometimes discuss AI systems relying on  biometrics as such together with systems that track certain bodily features that might not be  technically, and/or legally, be regarded as biometrics in a narrow sense. This is the case for  instance when is discussed the collection of data of micro -expressions, heart rate or temperature  data (CAHAI(2020)23 8).  In some cases, the boundaries between biometric data and other data are not clear. In this sense,   the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and the Spanish Data Protection Authority  (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, AEPD) co -authored in 2020 a paper that argues, for  instance, that the ' processing of mouse movement used to determine whether a robot is accessing  a website involves treating biometric information to differentiate human from machine' , and would  thus constitute biometric data processing even if the individual moving the mouse cannot be uniquely identified  (EDPS and AEPD 2020 3) , and even if the purpose of the processing is not to  uniquely identify anybody, but to determine whether they are a human being.   There are also other definitions of biometric data  in EU law, beyond the mentioned data  protection law instruments. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the Schengen Information                                                                  2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing  Directive 95/46/EC (General Da ta Protection Regulation), OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, pp. 1–88.  3 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities f or the purposes of the prevention,  investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free  movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA, OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, pp. 89–131.  4 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on  the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC, OJ L 295,  21.11.2018, pp. 39–98.  5 Arguing that Recital (51) GDPR brings confusion to the notion of biometric data in EU data protection law, as opposed to  clarity: Jasserand -Breeman  2019 156. 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      4 System (SIS)6 adds to the definition the explicit mention of ' photographs ' (in addition to facial  images) , and of DNA profiles.7 For the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2019/8178 ' 'biometric data '  means fingerprint data or facial images or both' . Regulation (EU) 2019/816 defines for its purposes  'facial image ' as 'a digital image of a person 's face '.9  In relation to DNA profiles, it must be noted that currently EU data protection law regulates DNA  data primarily through the category of 'genetic data '.10 Notwithstanding the fact that the processing  of DNA data can have serious implications for fundamental rights, their discussion is not directly  related to the core developments addressed in this study , and thus DNA data will only be mentioned  when specifically relevant.   The European Commission' s proposal for an AI Act provides definition for three different types of AI  systems explicitly connected to the processing of biometric  data: remote biometric identification  systems, defined as AI systems  used  'for the purpose of identifying natural persons at a distance  through the comparison of a person 's biometric data with the biometric data contained in a  reference database, and without pri or knowledge of the user of the AI system whether the person  will be present and can be identified ' (proposed Article 3(36) AIA), emotion recognition systems ,  defined as AI systems used 'for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of  natural persons on the basis of their biometric data ' (proposed Article 3(34) AIA), and biometric  categorisation systems , defined as AI systems used 'for the purpose of assigning natural  persons  to specific categories, such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, ethnic origin or sexual or  political orientation, on the basis of their biometric data ' (proposed Article 3(35) AIA) (COM(2021)  206 final 42)  (see Figure 1).                                                                   6 Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 November 2018 on the establishment,  operation and use of the Schenge n Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation  in criminal matters, amending and repealing Council Decision 2007/533/JHA, and repealing Regulation (EC) No  1986/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council and C ommission Decision 2010/261/EU, OJ L 312, 7.12.2018.   7 Cf.: '"biometric data " means personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical or  physiological characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural  person, namely photographs, facial images, dactyloscopic data and DNA profile ', Art. 3(12) of Regulation (EU)  2018/1862. The instrument also defines ' dactyloscopic data'  ('data on fingerprints and palm prints which due to the ir  unique character and the reference points contained therein enable accurate and conclusive comparisons on a  person's identity ', Art. 3(13)), ' facial image'  ('digital images of the face with sufficient image resolution and quality to  be used in automated  biometric matching ', Art. 3(14)), and ' DNA profile ' ('a letter or number code which represents a  set of identification characteristics of the noncoding part of an analysed human DNA sample, namely the particular  molecular structure at the various DNA loca tions (loci) ', Art. 3(15)).   8 Art. 4(11) of Regulation (EU) 2019/817 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 on establishing a  framework for interoperability between EU information systems in the field of borders and visa and amending  Regulations (EC) No 767/2008, (EU) 2016/399, (EU) 2017/2226, (EU) 2018/1240, (EU) 2018/1726 and (EU) 2018/1861 of  the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Decisions 2004/512/EC and 2008/633/JHA, OJ L 135,  22.5.2019, pp. 27–84. This Regulation also defines ' biometric templa te' (as 'a mathematical representation obtained  by feature extraction from biometric data limited to the characteristics necessary to perform identifications and verifications ', Art. 4(12)).   9 Regulation (EU) 2019/816 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 establishing a centralised  system for the identification of Member States holding conviction information on third -country nationals and  stateless persons (ECRIS -TCN) t o supplement the European Criminal Records Information System and amending  Regulation (EU) 2018/1726, OJ L 135, 22.5.2019, pp. 1–26.  10 Defined as ' personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give  unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in particular, from an  analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question'  (Art. 4(13) GDPR; Art. 3(12) LED; Art. 3(17) EU DP  Reg). Recital (34) o f the GDPR further explains: ' Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the  inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA)  analysis, or from the analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained '. 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      5 Nevertheless, the use of these terms is not yet fully consolidated at EU level, and thus one of the  objectives of the study is to unpack their meaning and possible limitations. All in all, it is possible to  refer to the developments discu ssed in the study as ' biometrics -driven AI' , or AI technologies  developed around the use of biometrics understood in a broad sense –  that is, not necessarily as  biometrics aiming at identificatio n. Another relevant term might be ' AI-enabled biometric  technologies ', if used to refer to AI technologies driven by AI which are capable of identifying,  analysing and recognizing human traits.   Figure 1 - Types of AI systems defined by the processing of biometric data (in light of the  proposed AI Act)    2.2. Methodology and use of resources  This study has been elaborated on the basis of desk -research, including traditional literature review.  The selection of mob ilised resources has been taken place on the basis of standard legal research  criteria, giving special attention to applicable law, both primary and secondary law. For the  identification and discussion of the challenges to human rights and ethical consider ations, the focus  has been placed on EU fundamental rights, and the relevant legal framework and case- law has been  explored. In addition, special consideration has been given to the work of data protection  supervisory authorities. For the analysis of polic y developments, the output of the main relevant EU  institutions has been considered. Although the focus of the study is the EU framework, due  consideration has been given to international developments when relevant.

STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      6 3. Synthesis of the research work and findings   This part of the study offers the main insights gathered from the research work. First, an overview of  the current trends in biometrics and AI is provided , including technological considerations and  information about notable uses, as well as specific i nformation in relation to remote biometric  identification, 'emotion recognition'  and biometric categorisation. Second, the regulatory  framework is p resented , illustrating that the ongoing developments in the area of biometrics and AI  do not occur in a lega l vacuum, but amidst pre -existing legal provisions and overarching EU  fundamental rights obligations. Third , are reviewed the current policy discussions, in particular in  the EU and as embodied by the European Commission' s proposal for a regulation  on AI.   3.1. Biometric technologies and AI   Biometric  data are increasingly used in many contexts. The fact that biometric data are, by definition,  enabling the unique identification of individuals, is of particular value. It is the fact that they are   'unique ' that makes them potentially more reliable than alphanumeric data for the purposes of  identifying a person.11 This is  in any case  the main reason why their processing has been  progressively integrating EU policy and legal initiatives ' in order to assist in the reliable identification  of the individuals ' (Recital (20) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1862).  The following sub -sections  further describe  biometric technologies, present some  key areas of use  of biometrics in combination with AI, and finally discuss separately remote biometric identification,  biometric categorisation and ' emotion recognition' .   3.1.1.  Biometric technologies   Biometric technologies utilise various body characteristics, which can be called sources of  biometric data  or reference measures (Bygrave and Tosoni  212). The Article 29 Working Party   argued that sources of biometric data shall not be considered biometric data themselves, but they  can be used for the collection of personal data (Art29 WP193 4).   The sources of biometric data can relate to the physical , physiological or behavioural  characteristics  of a natural person. Technologies relying on the processing of p hysiological  characteristics can include: fingerprint verification, finger image analysis, iris recognition, retina  analysis, face recognition, outline of hand patterns, ear shape recognition, body odour detection,  voice recognition, DNA pattern analysis , or sweat pore analysis (Art29 WP193 4). These are thus  characteristics that could be described as visual , auditory, olfactory or chemical . Behavioural  characteristics can include hand -written signature verification, gait analysis,  or way of walking or  moving (Art29 WP193 4).   Behavioural biometric systems started gathering much attention years ago mainly in the context  of computer security, b ecause although they  might not by themselves be ' unique enough to  provide reliable human identification, [...] have been shown to provide sufficiently high accuracy identity verification ' (Yampolskiy and Govindaraju 2008 82). 12 Examples of behavioural biome trics  include indeed human computer interaction (HCI) -based biometrics, which are concerned with  metrics about humans ' interaction with devices, such as way of using a keyboard or mouse, or their  interaction with software (idem). Keystroke biometrics, for instance, uses ' the cadence of an  individual 's typing pattern for recognition' , which has potential under some conditions but has a                                                                  11 In this sense, see Recital (18) of Regulation (EU) 2019/817.   12 Generally speaki ng, physiological biometric based authentication systems are believed to perform better than  behavioural biometric based authentication systems ( Ramu, Suthendran, and Arivoli  2019 10031).  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      7 limited level of accuracy due to factors such as distraction, fatigue, or emotions provoking variations  in typing rhythm (Ra mu, Suthendran, and Arivoli 2019 10031). Mobile behavioural biometrics   focus on behavioural biometrics related to mobile and wearable devices, measuring for instance the  touching of screens, or processing accelerometer -based and gyroscope -based data (Eglit is, Guest  and Deravi 2020). Behavioural biometrics have also more recently attracted much attention in the  field of banking and payment (Thales 2020).   For a characteristic or trait to be suitable for biometric application s, factors to be considered are tha t  it should  be universal , that is, in principle possessed by every relevant individual ; unique,  in the  sense of  sufficiently different across members of the population; permanent , or sufficiently  invariant over time; and measurable , meaning it should be possible to be acquired, digitized and  further processed to extract representative features (Pato and Millett 2010 34- 35).   There exist multiple possible classifications of biometric systems. An often -used distinction opposes  biometric technologies based on unimodal  biometric systems, i.e., based on one single biometric  trait, and multimodal modal systems, i.e., based on more than one trait. Multimodal biometric  systems typically aim at mitigating or compensating some of the perceived limitations of unim odal  biometric systems, for instance to limit the risk of spoofing, with the aim of making the systems more  robust (Ross and Jain 2004; Sanjekar and Patil 2013).  A term often used in this field is 'soft biometrics' . Th e term can have  different meanings. ' Soft  biometrics ' has for instance been defined as 'biometric characteristics which are specific to an  individual; however, not in themselves unique –  subject age, e.g. or gender ' (Fairhurst, Li and Da  Costa -Abreu 2017 369), and there has been special interest from some researchers to work on the  ability 'to predict soft biometric characteristics from conventional biometric data ' (idem). The term   is however also  sometimes used to refer precisely to the systems that claim to be able to infer  demographic charac teristics, emotional states, and personality traits from bodily – but not  necessarily biometric -  data (Kak 2020 6).   The Article 29 Working Party, which provided guidance on the interpretation of EU data protection  law before being replaced with the adven t of the GDPR by the European Data Protection Board  (EDPB), had defined what it designated as  'so-called soft biometrics'  as 'the use of very common  traits not suitable to clearly distinguish or identify an individual but that allow enhancing the  performance of other identification systems ' (Art29 WP193 16).   Two important trends have actually been described in this area: first, there is literature on how to  use soft biometric information to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems, and,  second, there is work on how to predict ' soft biometrics'  from traditional biometrics (Fairhurst, Li  and Da Costa -Abreu 2017 370). Soft biometrics have themselves been divided into ' lower-level soft  biometrics ', dealing with prediction of demographic information typified by age and gender; and  'higher -level characteristics ', about ' the prediction of what can be called the emotional or mental  state of a subject ' (idem).   It is not always straightforward to pinpoint the exact ' biometric ' component of some technologies  that are sometimes presented as related to or building on biometrics, unless this term is understood in a  rather  broad sense. For instance, some European Commission services have qualified as  'biometrics -enabled driver monitoring systems ' the systems developed to automatically detect  and evaluate the level of awareness of drivers through detection of drowsiness and other distractions (European Commission 2018 4). It is unclear how levels of drowsiness could generally  be speaking allow for uniq uely identifying individuals.  As already noted, the European Commission 's  proposed regulation  on AI defines ' biometric data ' exactly as the GDPR, that is, as:   'personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiologic al  or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      8 identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data ' (COM(2021)  206 final 42).   This legal definition can be qualified as narrow  as, even though it potentially encompasses a broad  spectrum of data related to possible physical, physiological and behavioural characteristics, such  data will only qualify as biometric data if they allow or confirm the unique identification of an  individ ual.  Broadly speaking, it is often stated that biometrics can be used for the purpose of verification,  identification, or categorisation. Biometric verification, also known as authentication, concerns the  (one -to-one) comparison between two sets of biometr ic data –  for instance, two facial images –  in  order to determine whether they belong to the same person (FRA 2020(a) 6 -7). Biometric  identification refers to comparing a person 's template with many other templates, to find out if  that person' s template im age is part of the latter group; in relation to facial images, this is often  referred to as ' automated facial recognition'  (idem).  Biometric categorisation, also referred to as  segregation,  may be described as a biometric technology used to extract informa tion about an  individual 's characteristics in order to assign him  or her to a certain category with predefined  characteristics; in relation to facial images, this is sometimes referred to as ' face analysis ' (FRA 2020(a)  6-8).  These notions might be technic ally and conceptually distinct, but nevertheless they can be  connected  in 'real life ' practices. It is possible, for instance, to decide to first attempt to assign a  person to a certain category in order to  conveniently  reduce the size of the group whose b iometric  data needs to be analysed for identification purposes.   In the context of this study it is  important to note that here the term biometrics is not necessarily   systematically  used in the same sense as in EU data protection law – and thus in the same sense as  in the proposed AIA , as the data processed might not allow per se for the identification of  individuals , notwithstanding the fact that further processing might allow for such identification.   Other typologies of biometrics sometimes used distingui sh between ' strong ' and 'weak ' biometrics  – depending on their reliability for identifying individuals – and between 'generations ' of  biometrics, on the basis of their historical emergence (Mordini, Tzovaras, and Ashton 2012 8-10).  Biometrics technologies can present important differences  between them, as the behavioral and  biological phenomena on which they are based have specific statistical properties, distinctiveness,  and varying stabilities under different natural physiological conditions, in addition to triggering  different environmental challenges (Pato and Millett 2010 4).  The degree of universality, uniqueness,  permanence and measurability varies between biometric techniques (Art29 WP193 3).   Progress in the field of biometrics technologies has been marked by the evolution of the algorithms  used, as well as  the evolution of  hardware (eu-LISA 2015). Notable trends in the past years have  included refining strategies for quick searches  in biometric identification transactions, as the  constant growth of d atabases to be searched represents a challenge for quick identification. It   notably emerged that ' [i]n situations where the person to be identified is present, the database can  be trimmed based on gender, date of birth, nationality or other factors ' (ibid.  33). In this context, the  categorisation of individuals thus  surfaced as a means to facilitate their identification.   The use of AI -enabled biometrics can lead to outcomes such as false positives and false negatives ,  a false positive being for instance the wrong match of a certain template with an individual  (FRA  2020(a) 9)). The likeliness of a false positive is measured by the False Accept Rate (FAR) which  quantifies the ' probability that a biometric system will incorrectly identify an individual or will fail to 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      9 reject an impostor ' (Art29 WP193 6).13 As the relevant algorithm s are based on probabilities, when  using these systems it is necessary to establish thresholds and ra nk-lists to determine how decisions  about matches  are taken (FRA 2020(a) 9- 10). This can involve a  'trade -off' between foreseeable false  positives and foreseeable false negatives (Art29 WP193 6) , and in this regard it becomes important  to asse ss if the rates diverge depending on some characteristics of the individuals –  such as, for  instance, their type of skin.    Studies of biometric technologies have often highlighted their limitations, most notably in terms of  bias – with authors noting that some of the ' most egregious examples ' of problems with these  technologies 'occur reliably where gender, race, class, sexuality, and disability identities are  constructed as other ' (Magnet 2011 153).  Beyond the development of biometric technologies as such, an important ongoing development is  the refinement of advanced data practices including  biometric data but also its  'integration with  big-data ecosystems which combine large datasets from multiple sources such as social media ' (ICO  2021 5)  or immigration data (ICO 2021 19) .  The exact demarcation between biometric technologies and other technologies  can be  sometimes open to debate. In 2008, for instance, Karanja placed under the category of 'biometrics '  – in addition to fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris recognition - the use of ' language testing as  a form of identity control ' by asylum and immigration authorities in Europe  (Karanja 2008 340).  Nowadays,  there a number of AI-driven, emerging technological solutions  with potentially an  important impact on fundamental rights that do not  however  necessarily fall under the category of  biometric technology , although they might track individual 's bodies, and sometimes track them in  public spaces. This is  the case for instance of systems deployed to automatically detect individuals  wearing face masks  in public spaces in the context of the Covid -19 pandemic , which can help  illustrate ongoing trends and issues.   In March 2021, a French decree authorised the u se of smart CCTV cameras to measure the rate of  population wearing face masks in public transport .14 The decree states that the collected images  must be immediately transformed into anonymous data that can only be processed to determine a  percentage of peop le wearing masks, and that the collection of any data allowing to classify people  or to re -identify them is prohibited. The decree also exempts the pertinent personal data processing  from basic data subject rights guaranteed under the GDPR –  such as the ri ght of access and  rectification, and the right to object.15  In its assessment of the draft  decree, the CNIL  had  pointed out that the systems being allowed  by  the instrument do not have as an objective to process biometric data (CNIL Délibération n° 2020136 para. 8) . It also noted that in the situation at stake it could be justified to limit the right to  object,16 but that generally speaking it is necessary to be cautious with the collection and systematic  analysis of the images of individuals using public tr ansport, and with the automated detection of  some of their characteristics (ibid. 16). Such data processing, noted the CNIL, can indeed  generate                                                                  13 The likeliness of false negatives is measure d by the False Reject Rate (FRR) which quantifies the probability that the  system fails to match an individual to his/her own exisiting biometric template (Art29 WP193 6).   14 Décret n° 2021- 269 du 10 mars 2021 relatif au recours à la vidéo intelligente pour mesurer le taux de po rt de masque  dans les transports, JORF n°0060, 11 March 2021.  15 Referring to Art. 23 GDPR.   16 The exercise of the right to object in the described type of scenarios is sometimes challenging. The French company  Datakalab, for instance, which develops computer vision products to monitor public spaces , states in its online data  protection notice that the right to object can be exercised ' by  nodding  "no"  to  the  device ', more precisely with at  least three movements of the head of more than 25 degrees (Datakalab 2021 10).  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      10 a feeling of being under surveillance, lead to habituation and banalisation, and ultimately result  in increased  surveillance (idem).   3.1.2.  A variety of areas of use   The benefits and risks of using biometric technologies can vary depending on the area of use.  Humanitarian organisations, for instance, increasingly adopt biometric technologies for reasons  which include the technologies ' potential for accurate individual identification, and for combating  fraud and corruption –  despite the fact that the use of biometrics in this context can trigger specific  challenges ( Kuner and Marelli (eds) 2020  129- 130).17  The European Assoc iation for Biometrics (EAB) has stressed that biometrics ' have a strong impact on  the security of European  borders  and other governmental  and commercial  applications ', and  devotes particular attention to EU data protection law compliance by supporting Priv acy Enhancing  Technology (EAB 2020 14).  Some of the areas in which the use of biometrics has gathered more attention over the years is  policing  (in both live contexts and in criminal investigations), but other areas that should also be  mentioned are schools, corporate recruitment, supermarkets, airports and public transport  in  general  (Kind 2021). At airports, facial recognition might be deployed on different grounds,  including for commercial purposes.18 In 2021 were launched for instance experiments with facial  recognition for boarding planes at major French (Hue 2021) and Dutch airports.19  The Covid -19 outbreak is believed to have triggered an increased use of biometrics  in areas such as  work surveillance (Mascellino 2020).20 The pandemic has also gener ated some novel situations  such as a widespread use of online proctoring , sometimes relying on authentication and  monitoring using facial recognition, which has resulted in a number of issues for students (see, for  instance: Burt 2020). The wearing of face masks in public spaces has not stopped the remote  identification of individuals. Already in May 2020, in this sense, the European Commission awarded  a Seal of Excellence to a Spanish company developing facial recognition technologies allowing for  the identification of individuals wearing face masks  (Herta 2020).  Examples of potential future uses of biometrics that have gathered the interest of some actors are  the possible use of live facial recognition for purposes such as age estimation at the entrance of  agerestricted premises, for queue time monitoring and management in airports, and for photo  matching at leisure attractions to allow purchasing photos through an app (ICO 2021 19).   The use of biometrics in public spaces trigger s special concerns. 'Public  spaces ' may be understood  in this context as generally including ' any physical space outside a domestic setting, whether  publicly or privately owned' , encompassing ' anywhere providing open access to the public, such as  public squares, public buildings, transport interchanges or parks ', as well as ' privately- owned  premises such as shops, offices and leisure venues ' (ICO 2021 12).                                                                   17 Uses of biometrics in the aid context are extremely varied; see for instance, about a wearable digital necklace for infants  aimed at reducing child mortality, including facial recognition of babies: Sandvik 2020. On this subject, see  also:  UNICEF 2019.   18 Cf. for instance the Star Alliance Biometrics programme, which uses facial recognition at boarding gates, more  information: https://www.lufthansa.com/be/en /information- on-data-protection . The CNIL has stated that certain  uses of facial recognition for queue management at airport might be regarded as proportionate, as inappropriate  queues could represent a security risk (CNIL 2020).   19 See notably: https://www.schiphol.nl/en/page/facial-recognition -pilot -for-departing -travellers/ .   20 Mentioning examples of Dutch companies (a footwear chain and a department store)  that had decided to impose – in  2019 – a compulsory fingerprint authorisation system for checkout staff: Das, De Jong and Kool 2020 98.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      11 France has given much attention to the question of  whether  there is a need for  experimenting with  facial recognition in public spaces, after such experimentation was recommended in a  governmental White Paper of 2020 ( Ministère de l 'intérieur 2020 263). The White Paper notably  explicitly suggested that part of the experimentation should take place  without the knowledge of  the indiv iduals affected, claiming that such secrecy could be based on public interest (ibid.  164).    The Security Strategy  presented by the European Commission in 2020 stressed the importance of  the protection of public spaces, referring to terrorist attacks that h ad targeted  spaces such as places  of worship and transport hubs (COM(2020) 605 final 9). In this regard, a footnote hinted that  '[r]emote biometric identification systems deserve specific scrutiny ' (idem). The European  Commission also referred to its will to enhance public -private cooperation for the protection of  public spaces, and to the launch of an Urban Agenda  partnership on 'security in public spaces ' in  2018 (ibid. 10).  Security  a key driver of the development and deployment  of biometric technologies. In 2017, the  United Nations ' Security Council adopted a Resolution which stated that ' Member States shall  develop and implement systems to collect biometric data, which could include fingerprints,  photographs, facial recognition , and other relevant identifying biometric data, in order to  responsibly and properly identify terrorists, including foreign terrorist fighters ' (Resolution 2396  (2017) para. 15).  Many of the f acial recognition initiatives that have seen the light in Europ ean territory are local  initiatives , occurring at city level (Lequesne Roth 2021  31). Primarily concerned with transportation,  these local developments  have also been deployed in connection with cultural or sports  events ,  punctually focusing on schools (ibid. 32). Sometimes, cities manifest interest in projects which might  not involve facial recognition for identification purposes, but nevertheless are primarily concerned  with the massive monitoring and categorisation of pedest rians , for instance in popular areas  such as the city centre (on an initiative in Karlsruhe, cf. Marx 2020).   In Brussels, a number of actors  including key mobili ty actors  are supporting the Muntstroom project,  a procurement programme for people flow analytics in the city centre, targeting major streets and  public transport areas.21 The project aims to collect data to be structured in accordance with what  is described  'a  set of metrics that are  important  to  the understanding of public life' , which would  include categories such as age, gender and posture (Muntstroom PCP 2020 18) , automatically  classifying pedest rians  for instance also depending on whether they are ' walking leisurely with  intermittent stops ', 'walking at an average human walking pace' , or 'walk ing briskly and determined  without looking anywhere but ahead ' (ibid. 19).   The Impact Assessment accompanying the European Commission' s proposal for the regulation  on  AI echoed the interest of Italy in the facial recognition system Sistema automatico di riconoscimento  delle immagini (Sari),22 its proliferation in train and bus stations in Madrid (Peinado 2019), but also  the investigation by the Greek data protection authority about the use of facial recognition by the  police in Greece (Homo Digitalis 2020) (SWD(2021) 84 final  18).  The processing of biometric data has been actively supported at EU level23 in the context of EU -level  large -scale IT systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). These systems, initially  set up by the EU for asylum - and migration -management but increasingly also serving internal  security, almost systematically rely on biometric data (FRA 2018). The EU Agency for Fundamental                                                                  21 More information: https://www.stib -mivb.be/article-pro.html?l=en&_guid=90c280fa -8afa-3810-968f -eb0cea5e2307 .   22 On this case and others, see also: EDRi 2020(b) 20 and ff.   23 For an overview of national laws of EU Member States on the processing of facial images, see notably: Ernst & Young  Baltic AS 2020. 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      12 Rights has highlighted that the impact of these large -scale IT systems on fundamental rights remains  largely unexplored territory (FRA 2018 19).   It is in th is context that can be found the assertion that ' the use of biometrics is necessary as it is the  most reliable method of identifying third -country nationals within the territory of the Member  States ' (Recital (25) of Regulation (EU) 2019/816).24 Currently, the processing of facial images  is  foreseen in the context of all EU large- scale IT systems in this ar ea, except for the European Travel  Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) (FRA 2020(1) 13). The majority of these systems  encompass also the processing of other biometric identifiers, most notably  fingerprints . This is for  instance the case in the co ntext of the oldest of these information systems, the Schengen  Information System (SIS), which is regulated by multiple legal instruments,25 as well as Eurodac and  the Visa Information System (VIS). The VIS, which facilitates the exchange of data between Member  States on applications for short -stay visas and on the decisions taken in relation thereto, for instance  foresees the processing of fingerprints26 and of photographs. Eurodac contains the fingerprints of  asylum applicants and from persons apprehended i n an irregular border crossing, operating since  2003.  In general, the processing of facial images in this context supports biometric verification in order to  double check an individual 's identity, in situations in which individuals are supposed  to be  in  principle aware that the authorities are processing their facial image. Regulation (EU) 2018/1862, on  the use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial  cooperation in criminal matters, left however the door open for uses of facial recognition yet to be  determined. The regulation  establishes indeed that facial images should initially be used for  identification purposes only in the context of regular border crossing points . However, the  instrument also confers on the European Commission, for an indeterminate period of time starting from December 2018, the power to adopt delegated acts concerning the determination of the  circumstances in which facial images may be used to identify persons , other than in the context  of regular border crossing points  (Article 43(4) and 75(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1862). 27  The upcoming Entry/Exit System (EES)28 also deserves special mention. The EU Agency for the  Operational Management of Large -Scale IT Systems in the AFSJ (eu -LISA) has observed that the  Entry/Exit System (EES) 'incorporates a component for automated biometric matching,  which will  rely on machine learning techniques for biometric matching ' (eu-LISA 2020 5).                                                                  24 Discussing the fixing of identities as a driver for the use of biometrics: Martin and Whitley 2013.   25 See notably Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1862, as well as Regulation (EU) 2018/1860 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 28 November 2018 on the use of the Schengen Information System for the  return of illegally staying third -country nationals, OJ L 312, 7.12.2018.   26 Defined as ' the data relating to the five fingerprints of the index, middle finger, ring finger, little finger and the thumb  from the right hand and, where present, from the left hand ' (Art. 4(14) of the consolidated text of Regulation (EC) No  767/2008 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and  the exchange of data between Member States on short -stay visas (VIS Regulation).   27 Equivalent provisions are to be found in Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28  November 2018 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of border  checks, and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, and amending and repeali ng Regulation  (EC) No 1987/2006, OJ L 312, 7.12.2018.   28 Regulation (EU) 2017/2226 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2017 establishing an  Entry/Exit System (EES) to register entry and exit data and refusal of entry data of third -country nationals crossing the  external borders of the Member States and determining the conditions for access to the EES for law enforcement purposes,  and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement and Regulations (EC) No 767/2008 and (EU)  No  1077/2011, OJ L 327, 9.12.2017.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      13 The purpose of the EES is to record and store the date, time and place of entry and exit of third country nationals, calculate the duration of their authorised stay, generate alerts to Member States  when an authorised stay has expired , and record and store the date, time and place of refusal of  entry. In this context, i t will be possible for the immigration authorities of Member States to compare  the live facial image of a third -country national  with the facial image stored in the system for  verification purposes (Article 26 of the EES Regulation), which shall in any cas e 'have sufficient image  resolution and quality to be used in automated biometric matching ' (Article 15(4) of the EES  Regulation). In addition, the EES Regulation also foresees that in certain cases it will be possible for  both border and immigration autho rities to carry out searches in the system:   'with the fingerprint data or the fingerprint data combined with the facial image, for the sole  purpose of identifying any third -country national who may have been registered previously  in the EES under a different identity or who does not fulfil or no longer fulfils the conditions for  entry to, or for stay on, the territory of the Member States ' (Article 27 of the EES Regulation).   It is also important to mention the r egulation on the i nteroperability between EU information  systems in the field of borders and visa , Regulation (EU) 2019/817. This regulation  provides for  the creation of a shared b iometric matching service (' shared BMS' ), notably to be used in order to  perform multiple -identity detection every time individual file s (or applications or alerts) are  created  or updated in a large -scale IT system which foresees the use of biometrics (Article 27 of Regulation  (EU) 2019/817).  The Interoperability policy initiativ e gave birth to the European Search Port al (ESP),  a search portal  allowing to submit queries to simultaneously query the EES, ETIAS, VIS, SIS, Eurodac, ECRIS -TCN, a  newly created a Common Identity Repository (CIR), Europol data, and Interpol databases. The users  of th is portal will have the power to launch queries by submitting either alphanumeric or biometric  data  to the ESP.   The agency eu -LISA is responsible  for the operational management of Eurodac, of the second  generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), and of the Visa Information Sys tem (VIS), and leads  the development of the EES, ETIAS, and ECRIS -TCN, as well as the realisation of the interoperability  of these systems. In the context of their management and development, eu -LISA has awarded  significant contracts to European companies active in the area of biometrics (Monroy 2020). In June  2020, IDEMIA and Sopra Steria announced they have entered into a framework contract with EU Lisa for the delivery of the shared Biometric Matching System (sBMS) developed for the  interoperability of s ystems, described as a system that will be ' one of the largest biometric  systems in the world , integrating a database of over 400 million third -country nationals with their  fingerprints and facial images ' (Havas Paris 2020).   Eu-LISA has not only a prominent role in the management of large- scale databases with biometric  data, but also a documented keen interest in AI. In a report published in 2020, eu- LISA noted that  'the Agency can support the development and adoption of AI in the domain of borders, migration  and security by, for example, supporting the necessary computational infrastructure for the  development and testing of AI tools for the key stakeholders ' (EU-Lisa 2020 5).29  3.1.3.  Remote biometric identification   The expression 'remote bi ometric identification'  is nowadays being used by EU institutions  primarily to discuss the regulation of certain uses of facial recognition. Facial recognition  technology refers broadly  speaking to the technology allowing for the automatic identification o f  an individual by matching two or more faces from digital images (FRA 2020(1)  2). Technically, facial                                                                  29 The proliferation of biometric technologies in relation to borders is a phenomenon not limited to the EU; for a Canadian  perspective on facial recognition and borders, for instance, see: Israel 2020.  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      14 recognition can be envisaged as a subcategory of the sphere of AI known as ' computer vision '  (Wickert 2019 2), or a form of pattern recognition (Berle 20 20 11) . It takes as a starting point that  'facial images are probably the most common biometric characteristic used by humans to make a  personal identification ' (Datta, Datta and Banerjee 2015 4). Facial recognition technology should in  any case n ever be expected to be 100% accurate and reliable (Wickert 2019 3), due to its probabilistic  nature.   Live facial recognition technology  is an expression often used to describe the practices consisting  of comparing in  'real –time ' footage obtained from video cameras (CCTV) with facial images in  databases (FRA 2020(1) 1).  In the proposed regulation  on AI, the European Commission suggests regulating live facial  recognition through the notion of remote biometric identification, further specified under the  notion of ' real -time  remote biometric identification system s'. As noted, the proposal defines  remote biometric identification systems  as AI systems:   'for the purpose of identifying natural persons at a distance through the comparison of a  person' s biometric data with  the biometric data contained in a reference database, and without  prior knowledge of the user of the AI system whether the person will be present and can be  identified ' (proposed Article 3(36) AIA).   Next, the proposal defines ' real -time ' remote biometric  identification system as:   'a remote identification system whereby the capturing of biometric data, the comparison and  the identification all occur without a significant delay. This comprises not only instant  identification, but also limited short delays i n order to avoid circumvention'  (proposed Article  3(37) AIA).   Three elements stand out in this definition: remote biometric identification systems serve the  purpose of identifying individuals at a distance , comparing their biometric data with data in a  database , and without knowing  if the individual at stake is actually there  or not . In other words,  these are AI systems used for searching for individuals  on the basis of available biometric data  (e.g., a facial image).   European Commission 's services30 had in  the past used the expression ' biometric mass  surveillance ' to refer to ' [r]emote biometric identification'  as 'the use of technology for identifying  – out of a mass of people – individuals through the use of unique biological characteristics, such  as face, gait or voice, at a distance in publicly accessible spaces ' in a summary of responses to a  consultation on AI policy (EC DG CONECT 2020 11).  Remote biometrics are sometimes described as ' nonintrusive ' (Datta, Datta and Banerjee 2015 xxiii),  in the sense that biometric data such as facial templates can be collected without interfering  physically with the individuals concerned. Remote biometric identification has in this sense been  described as having a 'frictionless ' nature by the EDPB and the EDPS (Joint Opinion 5/2021 11). This  lack of obtrusion and friction represents as such a potential issue for the individuals, who might as a consequence not become aware of the fact that data about them is being processed, which makes  the systems potentially particularly  intrusive from a human rights and ethical perspective.   A number of controversies have accompanied the development of facial recognition technologies,  for instance concerni ng the rights of the individuals whose images have been used to train the  algorithms (Satisky 2019, Peng 2020).                                                                   30 Directorate-Gene ral for Communications Networks, Content and Technology.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      15 The UK 's Information Com missioner has identified as most notable issues connected to the use of  live facial recognition the governance of the sy stems, the automatic collection of biometric data at  speed and scale without clear justification, a lack of choice and control for individuals, transparency  and data subjects ' rights, the effectiveness and the statistical accuracy of the systems, the potential  for bias and discrimination, the governance of watchlists and escalation processes, the processing  of children 's and vulnerable adults ' data, and the potential for wider, unanticipated impacts for  individuals and their communities (ICO 2021 6).  Facial recognition can be used in a variety of contexts. It has particularly attracted the attention of  law enforcement . In the US, police use of facial recognition is widespread (Spivak and Garvie 2020  87). It must be stressed that not all facial recognit ion systems fall under what is  described as remote  biometric identification. For instance, facial recognition can be used exclusively for authentication  purposes, in a variety of contexts , by private or public authorities .31  Also,  it is important to underli ne that  the term facial recognition can sometimes be used with  variable meanings, for instance as a broad term to encompass face detection , facial analysis or  facial recognition in a narrow sense  (for instance, to recognise the presence of a face) . Some fo r  instance classify face detection,  face classification and face recognition under automated facial  analysis (Buolamwini and Gebru 2018 2). Some of these practices might not involve the processing  of biometric data, and, depending on the context, it could be that the data processing does not  necessarily fall under the notion of personal data processing.   A whole range of practices not necessarily relying on biometrics have indeed emerged surrounding live facial recognition, in particular in the digital -out-of-home advertising sector (ICO 2021 17).  Typically billboards will be fitted with cameras aiming not necessarily at capturing biometric  templates, but rather at estimating characteristics such as age, gender, or ethnicity, or detecting  brands (ICO 2021 19) . Some commercial practices such as the deployment of ' smart billboards ',  which combine facial detection and ephemeral data processing, have triggered some hesitations  among data protection law experts regarding how to guarantee that processing of personal data is  legally recognised as such –  in particular when those processing data claim that the individuals  monitored cannot be ' identified '. 32  For the purposes of determining the legal rules  applicable to these systems , it is crucial to examine  first whether the processing of data involves or not the processing of data allowing for the  identification of individuals , that is, whether it will be regarded or not as personal data33  processing,  and, second, whether the data processed can be qualified as biometric data.   In 2017, for instance,  the Italian data protection authority , the G arante per la Protezione dei Dati  Personali , investigated the installation nearby the central station of Milan of ' digital signage '  advertisement screens, which had been described as enabling facial recognition and tracking  (Garante 2017). The Garante nevertheless concluded that the responsible company 's devices did  only very briefly process images of passers -by, and not in order to obtain any template of their  faces  or to identify them  but to determine the presence of a human face in a specific area; to  calculate the duration of such presence; to infer information such as gender, age range, and distance                                                                  31 For example, in Morocco the use of facial recognition for authentication to benefit from welfare services is now  permitted, with the approval of the competent data protection authority (CNDP 2020).   32 On this issue, see notably: Earls Davis 2020. A pararell data protection issue concerns the use of CCTV cameras to protect  billboards from attacks (cf. in this sense the judgment of VG Mainz, ECLI:DE:VGMAINZ:2020:0924.1K584.19.00).   33 The GDPR defines p ersonal data as ‘any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data  subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference  to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors  specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person’ (Art.   4(1) GDPR).  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      16 from the device; and to carry out statistical analysis to evaluate the level of enjoyment of the  advertising messages. All in all, the authority concluded the devices carried out ' facial detection '  but not ' facial recognition' , to the extent that they were unconcerned with the processing of  biometric data, and thus data protection law applied, but only its general rules, not the ones on  special categories of data (idem).   There seems to be some hesitation among some data protection authorities regarding how to  apprehend biometric  data processing , at least terminologically . In its reaction to the White Paper on  AI of the European Commission, and discussing specifically remote biometric identification, the  EDPS called for a mor atorium o n 'automated recognition in public spaces of human features, not  only of faces but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or  behavioural signals ' (EDPS 2020 2), as if remote biometric identification could encompass the  processing of data other than biometric data , or behavioural signals could not biometric data.   In relation to facial recognition, a  significant development in is the emergence of pr ivate companies  that offer certain facial recognition services. Among them stands out Clearview AI , which attracted  global controversy in 2020 for scrapping massive amounts of facial images, matched to names and  other information, taken from the web withou t the individuals ' consent, and using these photos and  information to market surveillance tools addressed to private and public actors (Kak 2020 7). An  investigation by Canadian authorities concluded the mass collection of images by Clearview  AI, in  what was described as an ' unreasonable manner, via indiscriminate scraping of publicly accessible  websites ', and creation by Clearview AI of biometric facial recognition arrays was inappropriate ,  notably because the company used the images for purposes unrelated  to their original publication,  often to the detriment of the individual whose images are captured and create a risk of significant  harm to those individuals, the vast majority of whom have never been and will never be implicated  in a crime ( Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada et al. 2021).    A Polish company named PimEyes , which describes itself online as offering ' face search engine  reverse image search' ,34 was later decried for offering a similar product, albeit even more  problematically to any me mbers of the public (Laufer and Mainek 2020). In May 2021, the data  protection authority of Baden- Württemberg35 opened an investigation concerning PimEyes (LFDI  2021).  3.1.4.  Biometric categorisation  The proposed regulation  on AI defines biometric categorisation systems as AI systems 'for the  purpose of assigning natural persons to specific categories, such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour,  tattoos, ethnic origin or sexual or political orientation, on the basis of their biometric data '  (proposed Article 3(35) AIA). A first key element of this definition is that it construes biometric  categorisation systems as requiring the processing of biometric data , that is, of data defined as  allowing for the unique identification of individuals, but such processing sh ould  not be carried out  in order to uniquely identify them –  instead, to assign them to categories .  A second key element of the definition is that the examples of categories mentioned, that is, ' sex,  age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, ethnic origin or sexua l or political orientation ', correspond  partially to the categories of data recognised in EU data protection as special categories of data , but not fully: some special categories of data recognised as such under EU data protection law  are not mentioned in the definition, or only in different terms, while some categories presented here                                                                  34 See: https://pimeyes.com/en . The exact location of the company is unclear, the website currently refers to an address in  the Seychelles, but it has been pointed that until August 2020 a Warsaw address was used (Metz 2021).   35 Der Landesbeauftragte f ür den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit.   
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      17 are not regarded as special categories of data under EU data protection law. It is thus unclear  what   is the exact rationale behind the selection of the mentioned categories .  In this sense, it should  be recalled that the GDPR regards as processing of special categories of data  the processing of personal data:   'revealing  racial  or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious  or philosophical beliefs , or trade  union membership , an d the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of  uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health  or data concerning a natural  person 's sex life  or sexual orientation'  (Art. 9(1) GDPR).  Under the proposed definition of biometric categorisation  systems , a system assigning to an ethnic  origin would be covered, while one assigning to a racial origin would not; a system assigning to a  political orientation would be covered, while one assigning to religious or philosophical b eliefs or  trade union membership would not; a  system a ssigning to a sexual orientation would be covered,  but one assigning to a certain type of sex life would not. The logic of these choices is unclear.   Biometric categorisation is in any case also presented as applying when biometric data are used to  assign to an age or sex, which are not categories regarded as special categories of data under  EU data protection law , although certainly AI systems assigning individuals to such categories  devote attention.   In relation to 'sex', it must be noted that the AI proposal here diverts from the currently most often  used term of ' gender '. There has been much critique of automated gender classification, also  sometimes referred as automated gender recognition  (Keyes 2018).36 Buolamwini and Gebru  (2018) highlighted that ' gender classification'  features in facial analysis typically uses the binary  labels of female and male, following a ' reductionist view of gender does not adequately capture the  complexities of gender or address transgender identities ' (ibid. 6).   Finally, some other categories mentioned in the proposed definition of biometric  categorisation   systems appear to be  directly connected to a possible future  identification of individuals: assigning  to a certain ha ir colour, eye colour, or tattoos, might indeed constitute an intermediary step towards  locating somebody, who could be searched more efficiently on the basis of such information.   The lack of manifest logic in the definition of biometric categorisation systems might be due to the  fact that there is  currently  no established definition of this practice in Europe.   The Article 29 Working Party had pointed out in 2012 that '[d]ue to the recent technological  developments it is now also possible to use biometric systems for categorisation/segregation  purposes ' (Art29 WP193 4). They described what they called ' biometric  categorisation/segregation ' as 'the process of establishing whether the biometric data of an  individual belongs to a group with some predefined cha racteristic in order to take a specific action ',  noting that in these cases, ' it is not important to identify or verify the individual but to assign him/her  automatically to a certain category ' (Art29 WP193 6).  In this context, the Article 29 Working Party  provided as an example of biometric  categorisation/segregation an advertising display that ' may show different adverts depending on  the individual that is looking at it based on the age or gender ' (idem). Another example of  categorisation offered by the A rticle 29 Working Party was the use of facial recognition systems ' to  count demographics of visitors to an attraction'  (Art29 WP193 22). These examples, however, bring                                                                  36 Presenting it as a type of identity classification in automated facial analysis technology: Scheuerman, Paul and Brubaker  2019.  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      18 back the question of whether the attribution to a certain category is effectively based on biometric  data, as the document implied, or not.   The Consultative Committee of the Convention 108 has more recently stated that:   'the use of facial recognition for the sole purpose of determining a person 's skin colour,  religious or other beliefs, sex, racial or ethnic origin, age, health condition or social  condition should be prohibited unless appropriate safeguards are provided for by law to avoid  any risk of discrimination'  (T-PD(2020)03rev4 5).   The sta tement appears to endorse that facial recognition technologies can allow to determine, for  instance, the ' social condition ' of individuals, although it is not clear how such attribution should  take place, at least on the basis of facial recognition understood narrowly. What the statement  seems to aim at highlighting is that certain uses of facial recognition, or connected to it, go beyond  the purpose of uniquely identifying individuals , focusing instead of categorising them, which is  nevertheless not depriv ed of risk –  especially a risk of discrimination –  and sh ould  thus be generally  prohibited. The requirement that what should be prohibited is facial recognition exclusively aiming  ('for the sole purpose ') at categorising  is in any case difficult to reconci le with the fact that it might  apply only to biometric data, defined in reference to their identification potential.   In any case, the idea that certain information about individuals such as their gender  can be inferred  from biometric data , must be approach ed with extreme caution, as it typically either endorses a  very broad notion of biometric data, or a problematic notion of gender identification, or both.    In this sense,  it is worth k nowing that the EDPS and the AEPD stated in a co -published document  that '[d]epending on the biometric data collected, data can be derived from the subject such as race  or gender (even from fingerprints) ' (EDPS & AEPD 2020 1). The reference provided to back up this  claim, however, refers to the analysis of amino acids in finge r marks found in crime scenes  (De  Puit, Ismail and Xu 2014), the collection of which does not necessarily fall under what EU data  protection law qualifies as processing of biometric data as a special category of data , if such  processing is about measuring the presence of amino acids, as opposed to identifying individuals.   There is controversy about which information can exactly be legitimately attributed to individuals  on the basis of biometric data processing . The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights has noted that  '[c]haracteristics commonly predicted from facial images are sex, age and ethnic origin'  (FRA  (2020)(1) 8), while also commenting that researchers and companies have experimented with  inferring other ch aracteristics from facial images, such as sexual orientation (idem). While this might  be true, the facial images at stake might not constitute biometric data.   A paper sometimes quoted to support the idea is that facial recognition allows to attribute political  orientation to individuals is ' Facial recognition technology can expose political orientation from  naturalistic facial images ' (Kosinski 2021). The paper notably examines the predictability of political  orientation exploring correlations between political orientation and ' a range of interpretable facial  features including head pose (...); emotional expression  (...); eyewear (...); and facial hair'  (idem).  As such, the paper is thus not directly concerned with inferring political orientation from b iometric  data, as the described data do not constitute biometric data , as a general rule .37 Similarly, other  researchers have been also exploring possible correlations between personality and facial images,  but again not on the basis of the processing of bi ometric data (Kachur et al. 2020).                                                                  37 For instance, eyewear may only be regarded as referring to somebody’s physical characteristics if this notion is very  broadly interpreted; also, for eyewear to be regarded as biometric data it should allow or confirm the unique  identification of a natural person, but also constitute data processed through a ‘specific technical processing’; mere  information about ‘the person with sunglasses’, even if related to clearly to one specific individual in a specific context, will not constitute as such biometric da ta.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      19 A dispatch published by the EDPS (EDPS 2021) mentions as an example of research on facial emotion  recognition allowing for the ' detection of political attitudes ' that tried to measure ' spontaneous  emotionally congruent fa cial responses'  by means of electromyography (EMG) tracking of facial  muscle activation in participants reading sentences describing politicians ' emotional expressions  (Fino et al. 2019). Equally, this would not generally fall under the definition of processing of  biometric data in EU law , as such measurement can most probably not be used to identify a  particular person.   A paper sometimes quoted to illustrate that sexual orientation  could  be inferred from biometrics   is 'Deep neural networks are more accurate than humans at detecting sexual orientation from facial  images ' (Wang and Kosinski 2018). In this paper, the researchers processed images obtained from  public profiles posted on a US dating website, leading them to findings such as ' (a)verage landmark  locations revealed that gay men had narrower jaws and longer noses, while lesbians had larger  jaws ', or that ' heterosexual men and lesbians tended to wear baseball caps ' (idem). A replication  study stressed that it is unclear to which extent the degree of predictability of sexual orientation  from the type of images analysed might be influenced by biological features such as facial  morphology, and how much by differences in presentation, grooming and lifestyle (Leuner 2019  52). In any case, this type of  research was definitely not concerned with the possibility of inferring  sexual orientation information from biometric data.   It is crucial to note that legal disputes around the possibility for public authorities to assert  somebody 's sexual orientation regardless of the individual 's personal statement are not unknown  in the EU, the most important examples emanating from the reliance on tests and expert views in  the context of asylum applications.38 In this context, it becomes particularly important to avoid   backing up false claims according to which AI systems could accurately determine, on the basis of  biometric data, the sexual orientation of individuals.   Research on detection of ethnic origin based on facial recognition has  also  sparked much  controversy,  in particular linked to research on ' ethnical group face recognition'  encompassing the  Chinese Uyghur (Van Noorden 2020).39   The impact assessment accompanying the proposal for a regulation  on AI acknowledged that ' there  are serious doubts as to the scientific nature and reliability'  of both biometric categorisation and  emotion recognition (SWD(2021) 84 final , Part 1/2 19).  Finally, it should be noted that c ategorisation systems can be based on visual information, but they  might also  be based on audio information. In May 2021, a n international  coalition of musicians and  civil society organisations called Spotify to commit not to use a patent the company  had  obtained  early this year regarding speech- recognition technology (18 Million Rising et al. 2021). The patent at  stake, named 'Identification of taste attributes from an audio signal ', notably aims at analysing  speech to assign the speaker to categories su ch gender (based on speech frequency information)40,  age (based on information such as vocal tract length and pitch), or emotional state (based on  prosodic information) (Hulaud 2021).    3.1.5.  Emotion recognition   The AI regulation  proposal defines emotion recognition systems  as AI systems ' for the purpose of  identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data '  (proposed Article 3(34) AIA). Like in the previously discussed notions, those systems are defined as                                                                  38 Cf. for instance: Poddar and Rajam 2018.   39 For this type of research, see for instance: Cunrui et al. 2019.   40 On these approaches, see notably: Ali, Islam and Hossain 2012.  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      20 oper ating on the basis of biometric data . Here the main difference is that instead of aiming at  identifying somebody, or at assigning them to concrete specific categories, the purpose is to glean  individuals ' 'emotions or intentions '. There c an nevertheless be a thin line between inferring  emotions and intentions, on the one hand, and attributing individuals to certain categories, on the  other, for instance when AI systems aim at 'detecting ' certain reactions in people in order to assign  them to certain categor ies.   Emotion recognition has been described as a ' biometric technology ' which is, however, not  concerned with who people are –  by identifying them or authenticating their identity –  but rather  with how they feel  (Article 19 2021 13). Emotion recognition c an be connected to a variety of  technologies, but the most commented is what c ould be defined as facial expression -based and  multimodal emotion recognition that includes face analysis (idem 15).   Emotion recognition relies on machine learning. The algorithms used for emotion recognition are  often trained with data from databases in which individuals pose, representing manifestations of  specific emotions.41 It is sometimes amalgam ated with 'facial expression analysis ', understood as  'systems that attempt to automatically analyze and recognize facial motions and facial feature  changes from visual information' .42   In addition to or instead of faces  as such , could be analysed for the purposes of emotion recognition  body movements  or voice tone , for instanc e. Emotion recognition is indeed not necessarily  connected to the visual reading of body  expressions , but may also occur through sound. In 2012 the  Article 29 Working Party noted that:   '[i]n addition to using voice recognition as a biometric for identifica tion, a relatively common  use involves the identification of specific features within the voice pattern to categorise the  speaker' , giving as an example ' to analyse the responses of an individual throughout a telephone  conversation to identify stress patte rns and speech irregularities to highlight potential cases  of fraud ' (Art29 WP193 24).   The quote illustrates that distinguishing between inferred emotions  and intentions is not always  easy or relevant, as the AI system described would be concerned with identifying an emotional state  (that is, stress) to the extent that it is conceived as a manifestation of an intention (that is, deception).   'Intention recognition'  technologies have historically grown closely connected to ' emotion  recognition ', notably bu ilding on the assumption that there exists a 'strong relation between  emotional states and intentions ', for instance because '[a]nxiety status can easily lead to an  unpredictable action or a violent reaction'  (Tistarelli and Grosso 2010 83).  Emotion recognition has been regarded as being particularly problematic for various reasons. First,  it is highly contestable that it works as purported by its advocates: researchers have noted that  despite the effort in connecting facial movements to emotion, there are no 'reliable 'fingerprints ' for  emotion categories ', and no ' reliable facial movements to express these categories ' (Feldman Barrett  et al. 2019 49).   Second, emotion recognition is often in practice  deployed in a way that eventually leads to  identifying , tracking , and classifying  individuals across a variety of sectors (Article 19 2021 16). A  report on the deployment of emotion recognition in China recently highlighted numerous  problematic ongoing developments , in contexts including research for and use in  security  settings (for ' early warning ', closer monitoring after initial identification of a potential threat, and                                                                  41 See, for instance, some of the databases listed here: https://face -rec.org/databases/ .   42 Stressing that such  'facial expression analysis'  shall not be confused with 'emotion analysis in the computer vision  domain' , for which ' higher level knowledge is required ': Tian, Kanade, and Cohn 2011. 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      21 interrogation), monitoring of drivers (also from outside of vehicles, for instance to detect drivers  likely to commit highway fare evasion), and education (Article 19 2021).  The very grounds of emotion recognition have been criticised. The United Nations (UN) Special  Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression has  observed that ' affect recognitio n', which ' seeks to infer a person 's feelings, emotions or intentions  from facial expressions ', is 'based on highly questionable classification systems ' (United Nations  Special Rapporteur 2019 5).  The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) services hav e used the expression ' facial emotion  recognition (FER) ' to refer to ' the technology that analyses facial expressions from both static  images and videos in order to reveal infor mation on one' s emotional state'  (EDPS 26 May 2021).  Noting these technologies belong to the family of technologies often referred to as ' affective  computing ', they described FER as involving three distinct steps: a) face detection, b) facial  expression detection, and c) expression classification to an emotional state (idem). In thei r view, FER  'can also be combined with biometric identification'  (idem), which seems to suggest that they  would not interpret FER as necessarily requiring the processing of processing of biometric data.  However, in the same document FER is always described  as a biometrics technology.   The Consultative Committee of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to  Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) has taken some distance with the  credibility of what it calls ' affect recogni tion' , noting it could 'be carried out with facial recognition  technologies to arguably detect personality traits, inner feelings, mental health or workers '  engagement from face images ' (T-PD(2020)03rev4 5). For the Consultative Committee, this type of  affect recognition ' for instance, to hiring of staff, access to insurance, education may pose risks of  great concern, both at the individual and societal levels and should be prohibited ' (idem).   The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights has conceded that ' [f]acial recognition technology can also  be used to infer emotions, such as anger, fear or happiness, and to detect whether people are lying  or telling the truth'  (FRA (2020)(1) 8), referring to such technology as a type of  biometric  categorisation .  All major US c ompanies  currently offer emotion recognition services  and products , for instance  Google via Vision AI, or Amazon through the Amazon Rekognition API.43 Apple bought a start -up  operating in this area already in 2016 (Misener 2016). Microsoft is actively resea rching h ow to  automatically detect ' affective responses from audience members during online presentations ',  analysing facial responses and head gestures of participants in Microsoft Teams online events  (Hernandez et al. 2021).  The use of ' emotion recogniti on' is developing globally in a variety of settings. Emotion recognition  systems which would have been used by police, nuclear power station operators, airport security  and psychiatrists in Russia, China, Japan and South Korea, and deployed at an Olympic Games, FIFA  World Cup, and G7 Summit (Wright 2021). There were reports about a police initiative in India to set  up cameras to automatically 'detect distress on women' s faces and alert officers ', by detecting  changes in facial expression,  as a way to tackle  sexual harassment and violence in public spaces (Ara  2021, TNN 2021).                                                                   43 Noting that the product provides information on ‘The emotions that appear to be expressed on the face, and the  confidence level in the determination’, and that ‘The API is only making a determination of the physical appearance of a  person's fa ce. It is not a determination of the person’s internal emotional state and should not be used in such a way’  (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_Emotion.html ). Amazon further clarifies: ‘For example, a person  pretending to have a sad face might not be sad emotionally’.  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      22 A specific use of emotion recognition technologies is the use of AI for lie detection. The Article 29  Working Party had described as a type of behavioural characteristics which can be a source  of  biometric data 'patterns indicating some subconscious thinking like telling a lie ' (Art29 WP193  4). In this context, it should be noted that some Member States have their own rules on polygraphs.44   3.2. Overview of the regulatory framework  There is currently no European legislation exclusively on biometrics, as there is not, at this moment,  European legislation on AI –  although there is a legislative proposal on the table of the EU legislator.  Regarding biometrics, the most directly relevant specific  rules of EU law are to be found in EU data  protection law. In addition, the whole existing  EU fundamental rights architecture is fully applicable.   This section briefly describes such architecture and presents the relevant rules on biometrics and on  autom ated decision -making to be found in EU data protection law. I t also presents the most  important case law in this area emanating from the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) and the  European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Overall, the section shows that ongoi ng developments  are taking place amidst –  and possibly also somehow despite – existing rights and principles, which  might thus possibly need to be reinforced, clarified, or fine- tuned.    3.2.1.  General fundamental rights framework   The European architecture for fundamental rights  delineates the general framework for the use of  biometrics and AI in the EU. It is marked by Article 2 and  Article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union   (TEU). Article 2 TEU states that the EU is ' founded on the values of respect for human dignity,  freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities '. Article 6 TEU n otably establishes the legally binding force of the  Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU Charter). 45 In the EU Charter are  recognised a number of rights very often perceived as being potentially negatively impacted by AI,  such as the right to respect for private life,46 the right to the protection of personal data,47 and the  right to no n-discrimination.48   As a matter of fact, almost all fundamental rights recognised as EU fundamental rights in the EU  Charter are potentially put at  great  risk by certain developments of AI. In this sense, for example, the  tracking of individuals in public spaces can directly threaten the right to freedom of assembly and                                                                  44 For instance, authorising polygraphs in Belgium: Arrêté Royal du 28 juin 2021 portant exécution de l'article  112duodecies, § 4, alinéa 3, et § 7, du Code d'instruction criminelle déterminant les informations minimales devant  figurer dans le procès -verbal de consentement et portant établissement des exigences techniques auxquelles  l'appareil avec lequel le test polygraphique est effectué, doit répondre, Numac : 2021041700.   45 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, OJ C 326, 26.10.2012, pp. 391–407.  46 Art. 7 EU Charter: ‘Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications’ .  47 Art. 8 EU Charter: ‘1) Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. 2) Such data must be  processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate  basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the  right to have it rectified. 3) Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority’.   48 Art. 21 EU Charter: ‘1) Any discrimi nation based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic  features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth,  disability, age or sexual orientation shall b e prohibited. 2. Within the scope of application of the Treaties and without  prejudice to any of their specific provisions, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited’.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      23 of association.49 Also, certain uses of biometric technologies could affect the right to a fair trial.50  Importantly, some uses of AI systems can be regarded as a threat to human dignity , for instance  because they aim at substituting human free will with a computer decision.51  The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR)52  binds all EU Member States directly and is thus also relevant for the interpretation of the provisions  of the EU Charter. To complete the EU fundamental rights architecture, the fundamental rights as  guaranteed by the ECHR are also to be mentioned as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, which serve as a foundation of the general principles of EU law.   3.2.2.  EU data protection law   Biometric data are currently explicitly regulated through general EU data protection law  instruments such as the GDPR. In contrast, in the United States (US), some States have passed  biometric privacy laws already since in 2017, the most notable example possibly being the Illinois '  Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).53 The US has also witnessed interesting developments  about protection from facial recognition in a consumer protection context, such as a settlement  between a company and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which led to deleting facial images  unlawfully processed by an app, but also ' any facial recognition models or algorithms developed ' by  the company with the c ontested photos and videos  (FTC 2021).   It is important to note that the three major instruments of EU data protection law –  the GDPR, the  LED and the EU DP Regulation –  have been adopted exclusively on the basis of Article 16 of the  Treaty on the Functioni ng of the EU.54 This provision has also been identified by the European  Commission as one of the legal bases for the proposed regulation  on AI, to the extent to which the  proposal 'contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of  personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for ' real-time'  remote biometric  identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement'  (proposed Recital 2  AIA) (COM(2021) 206 final 42).                                                                  49 Art. 12 EU Charter: ' 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association at all levels, in  particular in political, trade union and civic matters, which implies the right of everyone to form and to join trade unions for  the protection of his or her interests. 2.  Political parties at  Union level contribute to expressing the political will of the citizens  of the Union. '  50 Art. 47 EU Charter: ' Everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to an  effective remedy before a tribunal in comp liance with the conditions laid down in this Article.  Everyone is entitled to a fair  and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law.  Everyone shall have the possibility of being advised, d efended and represented.  Legal aid shall be made available to those  who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice. '  51 In this sense, see for instance EDPB and EDPS, Joint Opinion 5/2021  12. Art. 1 EU Charter states: ' Human dignity is  inviolable. It must be respected and protected. '  52 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Council of Europe Treaty Series 005, 1950.   53 Which notably highlights that: ' The full ramifications of biometric technology are not  fully known ' (Section 5(f)). Biometric  Information Privacy Act 2008 (BIPA) 740 ILCS 14/1. This Act is the legal background of a major settlement that took place in 2020, involving the company Facebook and allegations abou t the use of facial recognition in connection with  Instagram (Cox 2021).   54 Art. 16 TFEU states that: ' 1) Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning them. 2) The European  Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the or dinary legislative procedure, shall lay down the rules relating  to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by Union institutions, bodies, offices and  agencies, and by the Member States when carrying out activities which  fall within the scope of Union law, and the rules  relating to the free movement of such data. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to the control of independent  authorities. The rules adopted on the basis of this Article shall be without prejudice to the specific rules laid down in Article  39 of the Treaty on European Union. ' 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      24 On biometric d ata  The 1995 Data Protection Directive55 did not refer explicitly to biometric data, even though its  provisions had been interpreted as encompassing biometric  data. It was with the adoption of the  GDPR and the LED in 2016 that EU data protection law for the first time explicitly tackled the  regulation of biometric data (Kindt 2020 63).  The GDPR indeed explicitly considers the processing of  biometric data for the purpose of  uniquely identifying a natural person as the processing of a special category of personal data ,  or 'sensitive data ', which shall in principle be prohibited .56   The EDPB has stressed that for data to be regarded as biometric data under the GDPR,  and taken  into account the definition in Article 4(14) GDPR,  three types of criteria must be considered:  concerning the nature of data (data must relate to physical, physiological or behavioural  characteristics of a natural person), concerning the means and way of processing (data must result  from a specific technical processing) and concerning the purpose of processing  (data must be used  for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person) (EDPB, Opinion 3/2019 18). In this sense,  the EDPB  has noted that the video footage of an individual cannot in itself be considered processing  of biometric  data in the sense of Article 9 GDPR (idem) , and that ' when the purpose of the processing  is for example to distinguish one category of people from another but not to uniquely identify  anyone the processing does not fall under Article 9 ' (ibid. 19).57  The GDPR  details, in any case , a series of conditions under which, exceptionally, the processing of  special categories of data such as biometric data can take place -  under Article 9(2) GDPR. In addit ion,  the GDPR establishes that 'Member States may maintain or  introduce further conditions, including  limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health '  (Article 9(4) GDPR).   The GDPR does not apply to all processing of personal data. When personal data are processed  for  the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the  execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to  public security, by authorities competent for such purposes, the LED will apply instead. Under the  LED, the processing of biometric data is not formally prohibited . It is  allowed, even if  'only where  strictly necessary, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and only:   (a) where authorised by Union or Member State law;  (b) to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;   or (c) where such processing relates to data which are manifestly made public by the data  subject ' (Art. 10 LED).58                                                                  55 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals  with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, pp. 31 – 50.  56 In this sense, Ar ticle 9(1) GDPR states: ' Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,  religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the  purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited '.  57 Although it is possible that biometric data processing occurs if the purpose of the processing of the video footage is for  instance to detect a data subject re -entering an area or entering another area (EDPB, Opinion 3/2019 19).   58 Is currently pending before the CJEU a request for a preliminary ruling on the possibilities for Member States to impose  certain collection o f biometric data (in reference concretely to a Bulgarian law providing, as a general rule, for the  taking of photographs for the file, the taking of fingerprints, and the taking of samples in order to create a DNA profile for all persons who are charged wi th a premeditated criminal offence requiring public prosecution) (Case C -205/21). 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      25 When the processing of personal data is carried out by EU institutions and bodies, in principle the  EU DP Regulation sh ould  apply. Under this regulation , like under the GDPR, the processing of  biometric data is in principle prohibited , but exceptionally allowed.   The explicit reference to the fact that in order to be qualified as processing of a special category of  data the processing of biometric data must be carried out for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural personal must be underlined. This  implies that the processing of biometric data for other  purposes would not qualify as processing of sensitive data under Article 9 GDPR . In addition, it  should  be recalled that biometric data are defined in the GDPR as ' personal data resulting from  specific  technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of  a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person '  (Article  4(14) GDPR), which means that only data that do allow or can confirm the unique  identification of somebody might be regarded as  biometric data in the first place, under the GDPR .  Additionally, already to constitute personal data, information must relate to an identified or  identifiable  natural person, and ' an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly  or indirectly ' (Article 4(1) GDPR).   All in all, this means that the processing of biometric data constitutes processing of  biometric data  for the purposes of EU data protection law, and mor e specifically to be subject to the special rules  on special categories of data,  if th e data  allow s or confirm s the unique identification of a natural  person, who is a person identified or identifiable, and the processing takes place for the purpose  of uni quely identifying that natural person.   A similar approach can be found in Convention 108+ -  the Convention for the Protection of  Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data 59 which was ' modernised ' in 2018.  Convention 108+ describes in  its Article 6 as processing of special categories of data the processing  of 'biometric data uniquely identifying a person' .  On automated decision -making   EU data protection law foresees a number of provisions specifically aimed at protecting individuals  facing automated decision -making , which are particularly relevant when considering the regulation  of AI . The most commented of all is certainly Article 22 of the GDPR, establishing that individuals  should  have the right not to be subject to a decision base d solely on automated processing ,  including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects  them, unless such decision is necessary in the context of a contract, authorised by an EU or Member State law laying down  suitable safeguards, or based on the data subject 's explicit consent.   When such automated decisions are based on a contract or on the consent of the data subject, ' the  data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject 's right s and  freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of  the controller,  to express his or her point of view  and to contest the decision'  (Art. 22(3) GDPR).   Particularly important for this study is that Article 22(4) GDPR establishes that the described  decisions 'shall not be based on special categories of personal data'  referred to in Article 9(1 ),  unless the individual has given explicit consent in accordanc e with Article 9(2)(a) 60 or if processing                                                                  59 Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic  Processing of Personal Data, ETS No. 108,  28.01.1981 as amended by Protocol amending the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to  Automatic Processing of Personal Data, CM(2018)2-final, 18.05.2018.   60 Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR: ' the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified  purpose s, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted  by the data subject' . 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      26 is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest in accordance with Article 9(2)(g)61 and if  suitable safeguards  are in place.62  The real potential of Article 22 GDPR to effectively protect individuals in light of the uptake of AI has  been contested on a series of grounds. Some relate to the limitation of scope of the provision, which  only applies to decisions producing a legal – or similar – effect. It is also important to stress that, as  previously mentioned, the GDPR does not apply in all circumstances, and provisions under the LED  are not fully equivalent.63 In other words, it has been argued  that the ' normative radius of Art 22  GDPR is more limited than its heading (...) suggests ' (Martini 2020 112).  Insights  from data protection authorities   Rules on the processing of special categories of data in EU data protection law are generally  perceived as particularly unclear and currently generate a significant number of consultations  submitted to data protection authorities (AEPD 2021 4).  Data protection supervisory authorities have not only published opinions, but also taken numerous  initiatives as well as adopted decisions related to the processing of biometrics. In October 2020, the  Global Privacy Assembly (GPA), which brings together data protection and privacy authorities from  around the globe, adopted a resolution on facial recognition technology highlighting the  significant risks to privacy  that it can raise, and stressing the importance of strong data protection  rules  (GPA 2020) .  In 2019, the French data protection authority –  the Commission Nationale de l 'Informatique et des  Libertés ( CNIL) – adopted a report  in which it puts forward a series of recommendatio ns, notably  regarding possible experimentation with facial recognition in public spaces  (CNIL 2019) . The CNIL  emphasised in this sense that experiments should in any case never aim at accustoming people to  intrusive surveillance technologies, or making these technologies increasingly 'acceptable ' by the  population  (ibid. 10).   Also i n 2019, the Swedish supervisory authority fined a municipality for using facial recognition  technology to monitor the attendance of students in school in the context of a pilot test (EDPB 22  August 2019).64 The Spanish data protection authority, the AEPD, has emphasised that the current  status of EU and Spanish legislation do not permit the use of facial recognition by private security  companies, due to the lack of legal basis allo wing for such biometric data processing (AEPD 2020).  The AEPD has  nevertheless mentioned  that it could envisage the possibility that some of uses of  facial recognition by private security companies would be permitted, if duly based on a needed law  and acco mpanied by the pertinent safeguards – for instance, for the protection of critical  infrastructures  (AEPD 2020 31).   In March 2020, the Polish Personal Data Protection Office (UODO)  fined a school for the processing  of biometric data of children  to regulate access to a school canteen (EDPB 5 March 2020). The  biometric data of hundreds of  children had been processed despite the fact that less invasive forms  of identification were possible: collecting biometric data was regarded as  constituting  a significantly                                                                  61 Art. 9(2)(g) GDPR: ' Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State  law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for  suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject' .  62 It is unclear  to which extent the formulation of ' biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person '  of Article 9(1) GDPR sh ould  be taken into account when applying Article 22(4), that is, whether what is prohibited as  a general rule are automated  decisions based on biometric data, or automated decisions based on biometric data  which are processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person.   63 For a detailed analysis, see: González Fuster 2020 83 -87.  64 Sometimes action is taken at othe r levels. The Belgian DPA, for instance, reported that in 2019 it contacted a school that  was planning to use palm scans  to check  the payment of  meals; the school eventually changed its plans (APD 2019  13). 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      27 disproportionate measure. The processing of biometric data was used to identify children and verify  the payment of  meal fees ; children 's parents had been given the possibility to not consent to such  processing, but in that case the childre n were only allowed to enter the canteen once all the other   pupils had entered . These rules were deemed  by the data protection authority  to introduce unequal  treatment of the children and an unjustified differentiation, as they clearly favour ed pupils  goin g  through  biometric identification.  Thus , relying on consent as legal basis for such processing was  inappropriate.   The President of the Polish supervisory authority emphasised in the grounds of the decision that children require special protection of perso nal data. Moreover, in the present case, the processed  data constituted  the data of special categories. The biometric system identifies characteristics which  are not subject to change, as in the case of dactyloscopic data. Due to the unique and permanent   character of biometric data, which means that they cannot change over time, the biometric data  should be used with special due care. B ecause b iometric data are unique , their possible leakage may  result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.   Another issue to which data protection authorities have been particularly attentive is the tracking  of individuals in public spaces by different techniques, including most notably Wi -Fi. In April 2021,  the Dutch data protection authority fined a municipality for illegal Wi -Fi tracking of individuals in  the city centre (EDBP 29 April 2021). Equally in relation to the monitoring of public spaces , it has  been reported in some Member States that complaints regarding the absence of due information  about CCTV operating in public areas are very numerous (AEPD 2020 103).   Finally, generally speaking, i n the realm of data protection law it has been highlighted  that 'the  proliferation of machine- learning and associated AI technologies (...) have the potential to blur the  lines between ' sensitive ' and other personal data, because they allow the drawing of inferences  about sensitive attributes when seemingly innocuous data are combined with other data  over the  course of their life ' (Clifford et al. 2020 20).  3.2.3.  Fundamental rights case law   Analysing the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) on biometrics, a series of points stand  out. In 2013, in Schwarz v Stadt Bochum ,65 the CJEU considered a r equest for a preliminary ruling  concerning the validity of Article 1(2) of the Council regulation  on standards for security features  and biometrics in passports and travel documents.66 Mr Schwartz had applied for a passport in a  German city, but he refused to have his fingerprints taken, hence his application for a passport had  been rejected.   In this judgment, the CJEU first found that fingerprints co nstitute personal data because ' they  objectively contain unique information  about individuals which allows t hose individuals to be  identified with precision ' (ibid. para 27). Since the taking and storing of fingerprints by the national  authorities governed by Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 is personal data processing, it  constitutes a threat to the rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data (ibid.  paras 29 and 30).   With regard to the possible justification of the interference with such rights, the CJEU noted that  consent could not have been the basis of the legal processing o f the fingerprints. In general, EU  citizens need to own a passport in order, for example, to travel to non- member countries and such  a document must contain fingerprints pursuant to Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 (ibid.  para 32). Hence, ' citizens of the Union wishing to make such journeys are not free to object to the                                                                  65 Schwarz v Stadt Bochum  (2013) CJEU C-291/12 ECL I:EU:C:2013:670.   66 Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 of 13 December 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in  passports and travel documents issued by Member States , OJ L 385, 29.12.2004.  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      28 processing of their fingerprints ', meaning that persons applying for passports cannot be deemed to  have consented to that processing (idem).   Regarding the proportionality of the inter ference with fundamental rights, the CJEU found that the  appropriateness of the used measure of storing fingerprints for attaining the aim of preventing the  fraudulent use of passport is not automatically rendered futile by the fact that the used technolog y  is not wholly reliable (ibid. para 43). Hence, a significant reduction of the likelihood of the preventing  fraudulent use of passports was sufficient for the CJEU to find that the measure was appropriate  (idem). Regarding the fact that fingerprints were collected in addition to a facial image, the CJUE  noted that ' the combination of two operations designed to identify persons may not a priori be  regarded as giving rise in itself to a greater threat to the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the  Chart er than if each of those two operations were to be considered in isolation'  (ibid. para 49).  Hence, the fact alone of collecting both fingerprints and a facial image at the same time was not  enough to give rise to greater interference with the mentioned rights (ibid. para 50).   Regarding the risk of the use of fingerprints for pu rposes other than those provided for by  Regulation No 2252/2004, the CJEU noted the particular role of fingerprints in the field of identifying  persons in general and that 'the identification techniques of comparing fingerprints taken in a  particular place  with those stored in a database make it possible to establish whether a certain  person is in that particular place, whether in the context of a criminal investigation or in order to monitor that person indirectly ' (ibid. para 59). However, the fact that the regulation  does not provide  for any other form or method of storing the fingerprints, other than in the passport itself, cannot be  automatically understood as providing a legal basis for the centralised storage of data for purposes  other than previewed by the regulation  (ibid. para 61).   The CJEU was asked to return to the last point in a more recent case Willems et al. v Burgemeester  van Den Haag , 67 where it ruled on the obligation to provide digital fingerprints for the purposes of  passport application under the amended Regulation No 2252/2004 's Article 4(3). The collected  biometric data was stored not only on the storage medium integrated into the passport or identity  cards, but also on a decentralised database. Eventually, local authority databases wer e to be  combined into a centralised database. The CJEU was asked to decide on whether Member States must guarantee that biometric data collected and stored under Regulation No 2252/2004 will not  be collected, processed or used for purposes other than the i ssuing of passports or other travel  documents.   In this context, the CJEU recalled that ' the use and storage of biometric data for the purposes  specified in Article 4(3) of that regulation are compatible with the requirements of Articles 7 and 8  of the Cha rter' (ibid. para 46). However, all other uses and storage of the data are not governed by  Regulation No 2252/2004, because the regulation  is without prejudice to any other use or storage  of these data in accordance with national legislation of Member States, and does not provide a legal  basis for setting up or maintaining databases for storage of those data in Member States (ibid. para  47). Hence, Regulation No 2252/2004 does not oblige a Member State to introduce legislative guarantees that biometric data  will not be used or stored for other purposes (ibid. para 48).  Since Regulation No 2252/2004 does not apply to such other purposes, the CJEU found that the EU  Charter was not applicable, hence no compatibility assessment with its Articles 7 and 8 thereof was  performed (ibid . para 50). However, this is without prejudice to compatibility assessments under  national law and under the ECHR (ibid. para 51).   Turning to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), important points, especially  relat ed with fingerprints, should be noted. In S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom , 68 the ECtHR                                                                  67 Willems et al. v Burgemeester van Den Haag , (2015) CJEU Joined Cases C-446/12 and C-449/12 ECLI:EU:C:2015:238.  68 S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom  (2008) ECtHR nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04 ECLI:CE:ECHR:2008:1204JUD003056204. 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      29 ruled on a case concerning two non- convicted individuals who wanted to have their records,  including fingerprints, cellular samples and DNA profiles, removed the crim inal identification  database of the UK.   With regard to the nature of fingerprints, the ECtHR noted that 'all three categories of the personal  information retained by the authorities in the present cases, namely fingerprints, DNA profiles and  cellular samp les, constitute personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Convention as  they relate to identified or identifiable individuals ' (ibid. para 68). Recognizing that fingerprints do  not contain as much information as cellular samples or DNA profil es, the ECtHR found that  'fingerprints objectively contain unique information about the individual concerned allowing his or  her identification with precision in a wide range of circumstances ' rendering them 'capable of  affecting his or her private life and retention of this information without the consent of the individual concerned cannot be regarded as neutral or insignificant'  (ibid. paras 78 and 84). In this context, the  ECtHR ruled that already the sole ' retention of fingerprints constitutes an interf erence with the right  to respect for private life'  (ibid. para 86).   In the context of necessity analysis, the ECtHR underlined that the state legislature must ensure that  there are specific guarantees that the processing of such data will be effectively protected from  misuse and abuse (ibid.  para 103). In this context, the need for safeguards is greater if automatic  processing  is deployed, not least when such data is used for police purposes (idem). Hence, such  collected data must be relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes of storage, it must be  preserved for identification for no longer than is required by these purposes, and it must be  efficiently protected from misuse and abuse (idem).   The ECtHR ruled that it constitutes a violation of A rticle 8 of the ECHR to store for unlimited periods  of time the mentioned types of information related to non- convicted people in a nationwide  database processed by automated means for criminal -identification purposes (ibid. paras 77 and  86). The ECtHR fou nd that such ' blanket and indiscriminate ' retention of fingerprints, cellular  samples, and DNA profiles does not ' strike a fair balance between the competing public and private  interests ' (ibid. para 125). Such retention was thus judged a 'disproportionate  interference'  with the  right to respect for private life and regarded as not necessary in a democratic society (ibid.). Crucially,  the ECtHR drew particular concern of the risk of stigmatization which stems from the fact that  persons who have not been convicted are treated in the same way as convicted persons (ibid. para  122).   Additionally with regard to fingerprints, the ECtHR in M.K. v. France 69 considered the case of a  person whose fingerprints were retained in a database held by French authorities; the fingerprints  had been taken in the context of investigations into alleged book theft, none of which ended in convictions.   The ECtHR here found that such retention interfered with the applicant' s right to respect for private  life. It ruled that retention of fingerprints solely for the reason of preventing future identity theft  would in practice be tantamount to justifying the storage of information on the entire population,  which would most definitely be excessive or irrelevant (ibid . para 40). With regard  to the exercise of  the rights of individuals, the ECtHR ruled that the deletion requests are not safeguards if they are  theoretical and illusory rather than practical and effective (ibid. para 44). As such, the Court ruled that:   'while the retention of information stored in the file is limited in time, it nevertheless extends to  twenty- five years. Having regard to its previous finding that the chances of deletion requests  succeeding are at best hypothetical, a twenty- five-year time- limit is in practice tan tamount to                                                                  69 M.K. v. France  (2013) ECtHR no. 19522/09 ECLI:CE:ECHR:2013:0418JUD001952209. 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      30 indefinite retention, or at least, as the applicant contends, a standard period rather than a  maximum one ' (ibid. para 45).  In Gaughran v. the United Kingdom ,70 the ECtHR considered the indefinite retention of personal  data (DNA profile, fingerpr ints and photograph) but this time concerning a person who had been  convicted.   The ECtHR stressed that states have a narrow margin of appreciation when setting retention limits  for the biometric data of convicted persons (ibid . para 84). However, it also noted that it is not only  the retention period that is conclusive in assessing it the state overstepped its margin of  appreciation, but also whether the state ' takes into account the seriousness of the offending and  the need to retain the data, and the saf eguards available to the individual ' (ibid. para 88).   In practice, retention of convicts ' biometric data must be modulated with reference to the  seriousness of their offence and with regard to any continuing need to retain such data indefinitely  (ibid. par a 94). Hence, if a state chooses to put in place a regime of indefinite retention, it has to  ensure certain safeguards that are present and effective, such as the possibility to apply to have data  deleted (ibid. paras 88 and 94). Whether further retention is no longer necessary must be assessed  'in view of the nature of the offence, the age of the person concerned, the length of time that has  elapsed and the person 's current personality ' (ibid. para 94).   Importantly from the perspective of biometric techno logies, the ECtHR reiterated the significance  of continuously improving technological capacities in the analysis of the interference with Article 8  ECHR. It noted that the domestic UK courts had made their assessment, in particular relating to the  retentio n of the applicant 's photograph, ' on the basis that it was held on a local database and could  not be searched against other photographs ' (ibid. para 86).   However, this conclusion has been ' superseded by technological developments ' since, although  the applicant 's photograph had been held on a local database which did not have facial  recognition or facial mapping software , these photographs could be uploaded on a national  database which does have such software (ibid. paras 69 and 86). Hence, the state needs to analyze  its compliance with Article 8 ECHR where the powers vested in the state are obscure, creating a risk  of arbitrariness where the technology available is continually becoming more sophisticated (ibid.  para 86).   Furthermore, although not concerning  biometrics, several important judgments of ECtHR point to  the limits of monitoring individuals in public spaces.   In P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom ,71 the ECtHR considered the case of voice surveillance at a  police station. In the context of the existence of an interference with private life, the ECtHR observed  that Article 8 ECHR also protects a right to identity and personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (ibid . para 56).  Hence, there is a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of ' private life ' (idem.). The ECtHR noted that there is :  'a number of elements relevant to a consideration of whether a pers on's private life is concerned  in measures effected outside a person' s home or private premises. Since there are occasions  when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be  recorded or reported in a public manner, a person' s reasonable expectations as to privacy may  be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor. A person who walks down the street  will, inevitably, be visible to any member of the public who is also present. Monitoring by  technological  means of the same public scene (for example, a security guard viewing through                                                                  70 Gaughran v. the United Kingdom (2020) ECtHR no. 45245/15 ECLI:CE:ECHR:2020:0213JUD004524515.  71 P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom  (2001) ECtHR no. 44787/98 ECLI:CE:ECHR:2001:0925JUD004478798.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      31 closed -circuit television) is of a similar character. Private life considerations  may arise ,  however, once any systematic or permanent record comes into existence  of such materi al  from the public domain ' (ibid. para 57).   Whether the way the information is gathered is intrusive or covert has no bearing on the fact that  such information falls within the scope of Article 8 ECHR (idem recalling Rotaru v. Romania paras 43 44).72   In Peck v. the United Kingdom ,73 the ECtHR built on its reasoning in P.G. and J.H. v. the United  Kingdom when ruling on a disclosure of CCTV footage by local authorities which resulted in  publication and broadcasting of the applicant 's identifiable image.   The ECtHR did not decide on whether the collection of data through the CCTV -camera monitoring  of applicant 's movements and the creation of a permanent record thereof in itself amounted to an  interference with applicant' s private life, because the applicant did not introduce a complaint in that  regard. Yet, the ECtHR provided some noteworthy remarks regarding the monitoring of individuals in public places.   The ECtHR found that the monitoring of the actions of an individual in a public place by the use of  photog raphic equipment, which does not record the visual data, does not per se give rise to an  interference with the individual 's private life (ibid. para 59 recalling Pierre Herbecq and the  Association 'Ligue des droits de l 'homme'  v. Belgium) 74. Conversely, there might be interference with  individuals ' private life if the recording of the data is of a systematic or permanent nature (ibid.  para 59).   More recently in López Ribalda and Others v. Spain ,75 the ECtHR ruled on covert use of video  surveillance of workers, in a judgment including some general points regarding monitoring of  individuals that should be taken into account.   At the onset, the ECtHR built on its previous case law, as described above,  to point out that ' a  person 's image constitutes one of the chief attributes of his or her personality, as it reveals the  person 's unique characteristics and distinguishes the person from his or her peers ' (ibid. para 89).  Individuals ' right to the protection of their image is ' one of the essential components of personal  development and presupposes the right to control the use of that image'  (idem.). As such, the right  to control such use includes the right to refuse publication of their image, as well as the right to object to the recording, conservation and reproduction of the image by another person (idem.).   The ECtHR observed that, while the relevant international and European standards :  'do not seem to require the prior consent of individuals who are p laced under video- surveillance  or, more generally, who have their personal data collected ', it is in principle necessary ' to inform   the individuals concerned, clearly and prior to implementation, of the existence and conditions  of such data collection, even if only in a general manner'  (ibid. para 131).   It noted that the requirement of transparency and the ensuing right to information are fundamental  in nature (idem.). At the same time, the ECtHR noted that ' the provision of information to the  individual being monitored and its extent constitute just one of the criteria to be taken into  account  in order to assess the proportionality of a measure of this kind in a given case'  (idem.). If  such information is not provided, other safeguards are all the more imp ortant (idem.).                                                                   72 Rotaru v. Romania (2000) ECtHR no. 28341/95 ECLI:CE:ECHR:2000:0504JUD002834195.   73 Peck v.

Spain  (2019) ECtHR nos. 1874/13 and 8567/13 ECLI:CE:ECHR:2019:1017JUD000187413.  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      32 Crucially, the ECtHR rejected a general proposition that:   'the slightest suspicion of misappropriation or any other wrongdoing on the part of employees  might justify the installation of covert video -surveillance by the employer, the existence of  reasonable suspicion that serious misconduct has been committed and the extent of the losses  identified in the present case may appear to constitute weighty justification'  (ibid. para 134).    It is also worth noting that there is an emerging case law on the procedures to be followed when  examining, using, storing and destroying data intercepted via surveillance. In Liberty and Others  v. The United Kingdom ,76 the ECtHR considered the interception by authorities, on the basis of a  warrant, of external co mmunications of civil liberties ' organizations.   The crux of the case was the fact the legality of a filtering process, whereby communications  between the United Kingdom (UK) and an external source, captured under a warrant, were sorted  and accessed pursuant to secret selection criteria (ibid. para 13). The process included five stages,  one of which was deploying an automated filtering system, operating under human control, which  selected intercepted communications containing specific search terms or combinations thereof  (ibid. para 43). The only protection afforded to those whose communications were intercepted was  that the Secretary of State ' had to ' make such arrangements as he considers necessary for the  purpose of securing that ... so much of the interc epted material as is not certified by the certificate  is not read, looked at or listened to by any person'  unless specific conditions were met (ibid. para  44). Yet, the precise nature of these ' arrangements ' was not made known to the public and there  was no procedure to permit an individual to confirm that the 'arrangements ' had been followed  (idem.).   After finding that the existence of such surveillance powers constituted an interference with the Article 8 ECHR rights of the applicants, the ECtHR found that an annual distribution of a report by a  Secretary of State did not contribute towards the access ibility and clarity of the scheme, since the  'arrangements ' were not revealed (ibid. paras 32 and 67). In this context, the Court recalled that ' the  procedures to be followed for examining, using and storing intercepted material, inter alia, should  be set out in a form which is open to public scrutiny and knowledge ' (ibid. para 67). Consequently,  the ECtHR found that the domestic law at the relevant time failed to indicate ' with sufficient clarity,  so as to provide adequate protection against abuse of power , the scope or manner of exercise of  the very wide discretion conferred on the State to intercept and examine external communications '  (ibid. para 69). In particular, such domestic law failed ' set out in a form accessible to the public any  indication of the procedure to be followed for selecting for examination, sharing, storing and  destroying intercepted material ' (idem.). Hence, the ECtHR ruled that the interference with the  applicants ' rights under Article 8 ECHR was not in accordance with the law (idem. ).  3.3. Impact on fundamental rights   Much has been written on the impact on fundamental rights of the processing of biometric data, of AI in general, and of AI enabled by biometrics more particularly – especially of facial recognition. 77  As mentioned  above , pote ntially all EU fundamental rights  enshrined in the EU Charter  of  Funda mental Rights  are potentially affected by ongoing and foreseeable  developments  in this area .  In this sense, d espite the existence of the described architecture of fundamental rights protection  in the EU, and secondary law such as data protection law, the European Commission in its Impact  Assessment accompanying the proposal for a  regulation  on AI  assessed that ' current EU law does                                                                  76 Liberty and Others v. The United Kingdom  (2008) ECtHR no. 58243/00 ECLI:CE:ECHR:2008:0701JUD005824300.   77 See, for instance: Nesterova, 2020. 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      33 not effectively ensure protection for safety and fundamental rights risks specific to AI  systems '  (SWD(2021) 84 final Part 1/2 35).  Biometrics and AI potentially allow for the broad surveillance of individuals, the potential impact of  which is not limited to one or more specific fundamental rights, but can affect democracy itself. This  has notably been emphasised by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, observing  that digital tracking and surveillance technologies can have a detrimental chilling effect  on citizen  participation in social, cultural and political life (Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe  2013).  Biometric data were explicitly included in the list of data the processing of which deserves special  protection under data protection law precisely because such processing ca n have particularly  serious consequences  for individuals and society.  Biometric data being irrevocable , certain data  breaches might imply that an individual is no longer able to effectively rely on such data, and unable  to modify it.   AI systems using biome trics are increasingly used  in social welfare administration, where decisions  significantly impact individuals ' lives (CAHAI(2020)23 10). The Article 29 Working Party warned in  2012 that biometric identification systems used on a large scale 'produce serio us side effects '.  Concretely, they noted in reference to facial recognition that ' a widespread use would terminate  anonymity in public spaces and allow consistent tracking of individuals ' (Art. 29 WP193 9).  AI systems relying on biometrics such as remote b iometric identification enable the tracking of  individuals at an unprecedented scale. The pervasive tracking of individuals in public spaces  can  seriously negatively impact the rights to freedom of expression, and to freedom of assembly and  association. Th ese systems can interfere with the population' s daily lives and normal movements,  but also alter the way in which certain individuals and groups are able to exercise social and  political protest .  The risks to the rights of freedom of expression, assembly a nd association are particularly visible in  the case of  live facial recognition.78 Using these technologies in public spaces might interfere with  the way a person expresses their  opinions, by compromising their  anonymity (FRA 2020(a) 29). The  resulting chilling effect might result in individuals changing their behaviour because they know they  are being watched  (idem) . Similarly, the deployment of  facial recognition technologies during  peaceful assemblies might discourage individuals from attending them, limiting the potential of  participatory democracy ( idem). Depending on how live facial recognition is used , and if used by  law enforcement authorities , it could interfere with the right to liberty.    The United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights has explicitly warned of the effect of  the increasing use of facial recognition  on peaceful protests.  A 2020 report noted that assemblies  traditionally have allowed participants a certain level of protection against being singled out or  identified, and that this ' protection was already considerably weakened by many States that  routinely made audiovisual recordings of assembly participants ' ((UN) High Commissioner for  Human Rights 2020 para. 34).   The Consultative Committee of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to  Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) has highlighted  that the use of live facial  recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments bares a particular intrusiveness upon the  right to privacy and the dignity of individuals , coupled with a special risk of adverse impact on  other human rights and fundamental freedoms (T -PD(2020)03rev4 5). The Consultative Committee   describe d the notion of ' uncontrolled environment'  as covering ' places freely accessible to                                                                  78 In this sense, for instance: Bergamini 2020 para. 26. 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      34 individuals, where they can also pass through, including public and quasi -public spaces such as  shopping malls, hospitals, or schools ' (idem).   A survey conducted in Brazil document ed a very high concern (95.2%) among trans indiv iduals   regarding the possibility that facial recognition technologies lead to their stigmatisation  (Silva and  Varon 33). This confirms other available insights. Throughout 2020, the Ada Lovelace Institute  established in the UK a Citizens ' Biometrics Counci l to deliberate on the use of biometric  technologies (Ada Lovelace Institute 2021). The deliberations notably showed that 'Council  members were particularly concerned to hear about unethical research using facial recognition and  other biometrics to attempt to identify people according to their sexuality or target them because  of their gender ' (ibid. 33).   In its LGBTIQ Equality Strategy for the period 2020- 2025, the European Commission observed that  'one of the emerging challenges in the field of facial reco gnition AI systems is the identification of  trans faces, especially during transition period ', referring to the then upcoming legislative proposal  on AI as an opportunity to 'address bias and unjustified discrimination inherent in high- risk AI  systems, inc luding biometric systems ' (COM(2020) 698 final 8).   The use of facial recognition for law enforcement purposes has additional serious implications,  among other reasons due to the accuracy limitations of the technologies and the fact that  inaccuracies disproportionately affect certain population groups .  The risk of discrimination has been widely discussed in the literature in the last few years. Racial,  gender -based, and intersectional forms of discrimination in biometric technologies such as  facial  recognit ion have been profusely demonstrated in research (Article 19 2021 40). Problems are  however not only limited to technologies ' inaccuracies across the skin tone and gender map, as they  can also be connected to cultural differences  in expressions of emotion (Article 19 2021 40).  Discrimination can be due to a variety of different factors, as well as to a combination of them.  Factors  include problems related to training data , problems related to the design  of the  algorithms, problems related to the learning  of the system while functioning, or to an  inappropriate use. The limited diversity of workforce  in AI can also have a negative impact at  different stages of development and deployment. The biases might be inco rporated in the  algorithm itself , or when indi viduals decide what action to take following a biometric match (FRA  2020(a) 27). Bias in AI systems is generally regarded as possibly originating also in bias in data  scientists ' methods , in the object of their investigation, in their data sources (e.g., s election bias) or  in the person responsible for the analysis (Mantelero 2019 24).   The quality of training data is critical for effectiveness and accuracy of biometric technologies. For  instance, in the specific case of facial recognition, accuracy is not o nly dependent on the amount of  training data ( the facial images processed), but also on their quality  (FRA 2020(a) 27). Quality can be  compromised when, for instance, the reflection of light affects the quality of facial images of fair skinned persons , or when too little light affects the quality of dark -skinned persons  (idem).  Maintain ing quality requires that training data is representative in that it adequately reflects  different groups of people. However, the contemporary reality is that training data o ften over represents white men, resulting in erroneous results for the under -represented groups of people ,  and to the disadvantage (idem). The issues identified expose a risk that some groups of people (e.g.,  women and dark -skinned individuals  in general ) are more often false positives, exacerbating the risk  of discrimination.   The work by Buolamwini and Gebru (2018) evaluated the performance of automated gender  classification systems to find that in the researched systems classifiers performed better on ma le  faces than on female faces, and better on lighter faces than on darker faces, the worst performance  being on darker female faces (ibid. 8). Later research has found empirical evidence of the existence 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      35 of demographic differentials  in many contemporary fa ce recognition algorithms, with false  positive differentials being much larger than those related to false negatives (Grother, Ngan and  Hanaoka 2019). The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US performs face recognition vendor tests (FRVT) to evaluate the performance of facial recognition systems,  including related to bias.   The impact of automated facial recognition is currently particularly  visible in the US, where it has  been more extensively used. In this context, in addition to technology performing differently  depending on the type of skin of individuals, meaning that the risks of fac ial recognition police use,  notably in terms of inaccuracy, are not equal for all (Spivak and Garvie 2020 88), it has been  highlighted that certain communities are known to be disproportionately enrolled in facial  recognition databases , and generally  disproportionately targeted by surveillance (Spivak and  Garvie 2020 88).  Publicised c ases of wrongful arrest of black people misidentified  by police facial recognition, as  well as several studies, indicate that many facial recognition algorithms are most accurate for white  men, but less accurate for other persons. The widespread use of facial recognition for law  enforcement has indeed been connected to a number of wrongful arrests, in particular of black men  (Anderson 2020, Hill 2020(a), Hill 2020(b)). In the US there was also controversy in light of reports of  retroactive use of facial recognition  applied to footage of participants to demonstrations  connected to the Black Live Matters movement (Vincent 2020).   In the UK, the Court of Appeal ruled that South Wales Po lice's use of automated facial recognition  was unlawful, in response to a case brought by a civil liberties campaigner, Ed Bridges , and Liberty. 79  The Court observed in the judgment that ' [f]acial biometrics bear some similarity to fingerprints  because both can be captured without the need for any form of intimate sampling and both concern  a part of the body that is generally visible to the public ', but it also noted the existence of a  'significant difference' , as automated facial recognition technology 'enables facial biometrics to be  procured without requiring the cooperation  or knowledge of the subject or the use of force, and  can be obtained on a mass scale ' (para. 23).   Generally speaking, existing data protection safeguards that might in principle apply in the context  of the deployment of remote biometric identification systems might in practice not be applied or  effective, notably due to the recurrent power imbalance between the data controllers deciding to  deploy the systems and the data subjects.80  In any situations where freedom or personal security are at stake, the impact of biometrics -enabled  AI can be particularly serious. This is thus also the case in the judicial context.  As underlined in a  report for the Committee on Equality and Non- Discrimination of the Council of Europe 's  Parliamentary Assembly, certain flaws in a the criminal justice system can have ' far-reaching human  rights consequences ' (Lacroix 2020 12).  Discriminatory effects are not always merely secondary to the deployment of AI systems. The UN  Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and  expression stressed already in 2019 that credible reporting suggests that the government of China,  'using a combinat ion of facial recognition technology and surveillance cameras throughout the  country ', tracks Uighurs  based on their appearance and keeps records of their comings and goings  for search and review (UN Special Rapporteur 2019 5)  (see also Human Rights Watch 2020) .81                                                                  79 UK, Court of Appeal, R (Bridges) v. CC South Wales , EWCA Civ 1058, 11 August 2020.  80 Referring to such power imbalance: Pen ner and Chiusi 2020 25.  81 Concerns have also been raised regarding the inappropriate use of facial recognition by law enforcement authorities for  tracking protesters in other countries, such as, for instance, Uganda (Kafeero 2020).  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      36 A study of how emotion recognition  technologies  are spreading in China alerts about the fact  that, even when identification as such is not the prime end, there are serious implications in terms  of surveillance . Indeed, their deployment is connected  to a concentration of state and industry  power resulting ' in constant, intrusive, and arbitrary qualitative judgements to assess individuals '  (Article 19 2021 36). In addition, it is worth noting that the very claims that emotion recognition  technology ca n infer people' s 'true ' inner states has in itself significant implications for freedom of  expression, as it gives way to significant chilling effects (Article 19 2021 37). When used in the  context of interrogation, the use of emotion recognition can run c ounter to the right against self incrimination contemplated in international human rights law, which includes the right to silence  (Article 19 2021 38).  Finally, a mention needs to be made of the rights of children . The commented ECtHR 's Marper  judgment of  the ECtHR (2008) emphasised the risks connected to the storage of biometric data of  children. The EU Agency of Fundamental Rights has been particularly vocal about the risks  associated to collecting and storing biometric data of children in the context of  migration, asylum  and border management control, observing that such data is often made available to law  enforcement authorities for law enforcement purposes (FRA 2017 32).82   For a representation of some key interdependencies between the processing of bio metric data – in  a large sense, identification and categorisation systems, and fundamental rights, see Figure 2.   Figure 2 - Identification and categorisation, EU fundamental rights and values     3.4. Regulatory trends and current policy debates  The potential impact of AI on fundamental rights and ethical principles has triggered many reactions  at policy level, in parallel with judicial developments and calls from the civil society.  Generally  speaking, at policy level the current trend is a shift from an emphasis on  the need to elaborate ethical  guidelines and principles towards  work on  legal instruments and legislative proposals. This is,  however, not a systematic development, and some calls stressing the importance of ethical  principles simultaneously also stress the importance of appropriate legal frameworks.83                                                                  82 See also, on fundamental rights concerns regarding the biometric data of children processed by EU large -scale  databases: Fondazione Giacomo Brodolini 2019 43.   83 In this sense, for instance, the Global Privacy Assembly (GPA)  in its 2020 Resolution on Facial Recognition Technology  reiterated the importance of ‘A n ethical approach to the use of biometric data’, but also of ‘ Legal frameworks that are  fit for purpose in regulating evolving technologies such as facial  recognition technology ’ (GPA 2020 3).   
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      37 The Guidelines on Facial Recognition of the Consultative Committee of Convention 108 incorporate  some references to the need of an ethical framework  especially for the use of facial  recognition  technologies in certain sectors (T -PD(2020)03rev4 15). According to the  Guidelines , '[t]his could take  the form of independent ethics advisory boards that could be consulted before and during lengthier  deployments, carry out audits and publish  the results of their research to complement or endorse  an entity 's accountability'  (idem). The Guidelines see a potential for 'committees of experts  from  different fields of expertise'  to discuss the most difficult cases in order to avoid human rights  abu ses and connect to this topic the role of whistle- blowers (idem).   In the literature, there has been much discussion about how to improve the regulation of AI, notably  in terms of fairness, transparency  and accountability . These notions are deeply intertwined, as  transparency is instrumental not only for instance in order to allow for the exercise of data subject  rights, but also to facilitate the detection of bias and discrimination, and thus support fairness.   Some researchers have in this sense  advocated t hat in order to ' support meaningful accountability ',  automated decision- making processes 'should be designed and developed to be reviewable '  (Cobbe, Lee and Singh 2021 4). In this context, reviewability is understood as involving:   'technical and organisational record -keeping and logging mechanisms that expose the  contextually appropriate information needed to assess algorithmic systems, their context, and  their outputs for legal compliance, whether they are functioning within expected or desired  parameters, or for any other form of assessment relevant to various accountability relationships '  (idem).   As possible ways to tackle bias, have also been discussed, in addition to the involvement of  committees of experts from a range of fields,  participator y forms of risk assessment (Mantelero 2019  25). The recommendations stemming from the Ada Lovelace Institute' s UK Citizens ' Biometrics  Council deliberations note that ' the representation of a diverse range of perspectives  needs to  be included in not just the development of biometric technologies, but in the standards,  governance and oversight relating to them' , and that ' for those communities most at risk from the  harms these technologies may pose, standards and oversight are not enough if they are not back ed  by law ' (Ada Lovelace Institute 2021 38).  3.4.1.  Overview of global discussions   Important developments have occurred in the U nited States (US) , where civil society has notably  called US President Joe Biden to act in order to stop the spread of facial recogniti on (Freedom House  2021). In 2020, major US companies made public announcements about stopping or pausing the  selling of some of their facial recognition products for law enforcement purposes, calling for a  regulation of its use (Heilweil 2020).  In the US, civil society concerns over to growing concern over the use of police facial recognition  have led to legislators introducing and passing facial recognition bans, moratoria, and regulatory  bills (Spivak and Garvie 2020 88). Moratoria might be sub -classified  into  time- bound moratoria,  pausing facial recognition use for a set amount of time; and directive moratoria, pausing it and  requiring legislative action to supersede the pause (idem).84 The Facial Recognition and Biometric  Technology Moratorium Act of 202085 introduced in the US Senate has as objective to prohibit                                                                  84 Moratoria have also been c alled for in other  parts of the world. For instance, the Australian Human Rights Commission   has stated that: ‘ Australia’s federal, state and territory governments should introduce a moratorium on the use of facial  recognition and other biometric technology  in decision making that has a legal, or similarly significant, effect for  individuals, or where there is a high risk to human rights, such as in policing and law enforcement’  (Australian Human  Rights Commission  2021, Recommendation 20).  85 Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act of 2020, S.4084, 25.06.2020. 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      38 federal use of certain biometric technologies until Congress explicitly allows their use with certain  limitations.   Regulatory bills  seeking to place restrictions on facial recognition' s use have also been introduced,  for instance proposing a court order requirement  for law enforcement to run some of all facial  recognition searches (Spivak and Garvie 2020 93). Bans  have seen the light, in particular  implemented by local municipal authorities, and concentrated in towns and cities in California and  Massachusetts (Spivak and Garvie 2020 89).   In March 2020, the Washington state legislature passed a public sector facial recognition privacy  bill, placing controls on the public sector use of facial recognition technology in the S tate and to  take effect in July 2021 (Halpert 2020). The bill86 sets forth requirements for the use of facial  recognition services by S tate and local government agencies, including accountability reporting,87  annual reporting, operational testing, independent testing, training, and human review.88  Accountability reports must notably include clear and understandable statements with inter alia :  'a descrip tion of any potential impacts of the facial recognition service on civil rights and  liberties , including potential impacts to privacy and potential disparate impacts on  marginalized communities, and the specific steps the agency will take to mitigate the p otential  impacts and prevent unauthorized use of the facial recognition service'  (Section 3(2)(g)).   Such accountability reports must, prior to finalisation, be public  to allow for a public review and  comment period (Section 3(3)(a)). The agency aiming at u sing facial recognition services must  additionally hold at least three community consultation meetings  (Section 3(3)(b)), and it is  obliged to take into account their input and the input from the public consultation ((Section 3(3)(c)).   The bill generally determines the obligations of users of facial recognition systems, and one of the  obligations of such users is to demand from the facial recognition service provider to make available an application programming interface or other technical capability ' to enable legitimate,  independent, and reasonable tests of those facial recognition services for accuracy and unfair  performance differences across distinct subpopulations ' (Section 6(1)(a)). The subpopulations  which must  be taken into account are those ' define d by visually detectable characteristics such as:  (i) Race, skin tone, ethnicity, gender, age, or disability status; or (ii) other protected characteristics  that are objectively determinable or self -identified by the individuals portrayed in the testing  dataset'  (idem).   The bill prohibits state and local agencies from using a facial recognition service for ongoing surveillance, unless specified conditions are met, and either a court order is obtained, or the agency  reasonably determines that exigent circums tances exist and an appropriate court order is obtained  as soon as reasonably practicable. The bill categorically prohibit s State and local agencies from  applying a facial recognition service based on certain protected characteristics , 89 as well as  creating  a record describing any individual' s exercise of certain constitutional rights. It also specifies  disclosure and reporting requirements, in addition to creating a legislative task force on facial  recognition. The task force shall include, among others, decision -makers, representatives of law                                                                  86 Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill, SB 6280, passed  by the Senate on 12 March 2020.  87 Prior to developing, procuring, or using a facial recognition service, a  state or local  government agency must produce  an accountability report for that service (Section 3(2) ).  88 Human review is exclusively foreseen when a facial recognition service is used  to make decisions that produce legal  effects concerning individuals or similarl y significant effects concerning individuals (Section 4).   89 ‘A state or local government agency may not apply a facial recognition service to any individual based on their religious,  political, or social views or activities, participation in a particular n oncriminal organization or lawful event, or actual or  perceived race, ethnicity, citizenship, place of origin, immigration status, age, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual   orientation, or other characteristic protected by law’  (Section 11(2)). 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      39 enforcement agencies, industry representatives and academics, ' [e]ight representatives from  advocacy organizations that represent individuals or protected classes of communities historically  impacted by surveillance technologies ' (Section 10(1)(a)(iii)).90  The Washington bill is based on the idea that ' [u]nconstrained use of facial recognition services by  state and local government agencies poses broad social ramifications  that should be considered  and addressed' , with  rules 'prohibiting uses that threaten our democratic freedoms and put our civil  liberties at risk'  (Section 1(1)). At the same time, the bill also notes that ' state and local government  agencies may use facial recognition services to locate or identify mi ssing persons, and identify  deceased persons, including missing or murdered indigenous women, (...) and other possible crime  victims, for the purposes of keeping the public safe'  (Section 1(2)), and thus its use should not be  fully prohibited.   The bill def ines 'facial recognition service ' as:   'technology that analyzes facial features and is used by a state or local government agency for  the identification, verification, or persistent tracking of individuals in still or video images '  (Section 2(3)(a)).   This  definition is thus broader than definitions of remote biometric identification axed on the  processing of data for identification purposes,91 which is the approach currently embodied in the AI  regulation  proposed by the European Commission . This is even mor e evident when taking into  account the definition of 'persistent tracking ' put forward in the bill:   ' 'Persistent tracking ' means the use of a facial recognition service by a state or local government  agency to track the movements of an individual on a persistent basis without  identification or verification of that individual. Such tracking becomes persistent as soon as:   (a) The facial template that permits the tracking is maintained for more than forty- eight hours  after first enrolling that template; or   (b) Data created by the facial recognition service is linked to any other data such that the  individual who has been tracked is identified or identifiable. ' (Section 2(10)).   Another salient feature of the Washington bill is that it regulates 'ongoing surveillance ' of  individuals defined as 'using a facial recognition service to track the physical movements of a  specified individual through one or more public places over time, whether in real time or through  application of a facial recognition service to historical records ' (Section 2(9)). This means that  the definition does not cover exclusively 'real- time ' or 'almost real- time'  facial recognition , but  applies also to data stor ed over time.   3.4.2.  Council of Europe   The Council of Europe has put in place an Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI). In  September 2019, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe mandated the CAHAI to  examine, on the basis of broad multi -stakeholder consultations, the feasibility and potential  elements of a legal framework  for the development, design and application of AI, based on Council  of Europe standards in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (CAHAI(2020)23 2).    A feasibility study published by the CAHAI in December 2020 notably asserts that biometric data  can be used, beyond identification or authentication purposes, ' to profile or categorise individuals                                                                  90 'Including, but not limited to, African American, Latino American, Native American, Pacific Islander American, and Asian  American communities, religious minorities, protest and activist groups, and other vulnerable communities ' (idem).   91 This has  a direct impact on the scope of the bill’s definition of ‘facial template’, defined as ' the machine -interpretable  pattern of facial features that is extracted from one or more images of an individual by a facial recognition service ' (Section  2(4)).  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      40 for various purposes and in different contexts ', while noti ng in a footnote that ' no sound scientific  evidence  exists corroborating that a person 's inner emotions or mental state can be accurately  "read"  from a person 's face or other biometric data ' (CAHAI 2020 8).  On 28 January 2021, the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals  with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) published its Guidelines  on Facial Recognition (T-PD(2020)03rev4). The Guidelines descr ibe a set of reference measures for  governments, facial recognition developers, manufacturers, service providers and entities using  facial recognition technologies to apply to ensure that they do not adversely affect the human  dignity , human rights  and fundamental freedoms  of any person, including the right to  protection of personal data (ibid. 3).   The Guidelines notably state that the use of live facial recognition technologies in ' uncontrolled  environments ', 'should be subject to a democratic debate on i ts use and the possibility of a  moratorium pending complete analysis ' (ibid. 5). The Committee declares that ' biometric data  processing by facial recognition technologies for identification purposes (...) should be restricted,  in general, to law enforcemen t purposes ' (ibid. 6). It also considers that ' [p]rivate entities shall  not deploy facial recognition  technologies in uncontrolled environments  such as shopping  malls, especially to identify persons of interest, for marketing purposes or for private securi ty  purposes ' (ibid. 7).  The Guidelines on Facial Recognition of the Consultative Committee of Convention 108 support the use by legislators and decision -makers of different mechanisms to ensure the accountability of the  developers, manufacturers, service p roviders or entities using these technologies, of which an  essential element would be the ' setting up of independent and qualified certification mechanism   [sic] for facial recognition and data protection to demonstrate full compliance of the processing  ope rations carried out ' (ibid. 8).  3.4.3.  EU recent developments   In January 2021, the European Commission registered a European Citizens ' Initiative  entitled 'Civil  society initiative for a ban on biometric mass surveillance practices ', calling on ' the European  Commission to strictly regulate the use of biometric technologies in order to avoid undue  interference with fundamental rights ', and, 'in particular, to prohibit, in law and in practice,  indiscriminate or arbitrarily -targeted uses of biometrics which can l ead to unlawful mass  surveillance '.92 The initiative is connected to an EU -wide campaign called ' Reclaim Your Face ' with  which a group of NGOs demand the EU to ban facial recognition in public spaces.    In May 2020 the European Digital Rights initiative (EDR i) had already issued a public call ' to  permanently stop all biometric processing in public and publicly- accessible spaces, wherever it has  the effect or potential effect to establish mass surveillance'  (EDRi 2020(a)). In June 2021, an  international group of civil society representatives and academics signed a letter calling ' for a global  ban on biometric recognition technologies that enable mass and discriminatory surveillance'   (Access Now et al. 2021).  The NGO Access Now, in conjunction with the ' Reclaim Your Face '  campaign and All Out, also launched a campaign calling for a ban of the  automated recognition  of the gender and sexual orientation, arguing that such technologies are not only scientifically  flawed, but also put lives at risk.93  In February 2020, the European Commission had published its White Paper on AI, ' A European  approach to excellence and trust'  (COM(2020) 65 final), which was followed by a public consultation.                                                                   92 More information: https://europa.eu/citizens -initiative/initiatives/details/2021/000001_en .   93 More information: https://act.accessnow.org/page/79916/action/1 .  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      41 The ensuing public consultation offered some insights on public concerns related to remote  biometric identification. As reported by the European Commission, 28% of respondents expressed  their support for a general ban of remote biometric identification in public spaces ; 29% asked  for specific EU guidelines or legislation  before such sy stems may be used in publicly accessible  spaces; 20% wished to see more requirements  or conditions for remote biometric identification,  and only 6% argued that the current situation is adequate (EC DG CONECT 2020 11).   In 2019 it had already started to bec ome clear that the European Commission was committed to  proposing legislation for an EU approach on the implications of AI (Von der Leyen 2019 13). By then  the Expert Group on Liability and New Technologies called for new rules on liability (Expert Group  on Liability and New Technologies -  New Technologies Formation 2019), while the High- level expert  group on AI ( AI HLEG) worked on guidelines for AI systems to be 'trustworthy '. The AI HLEG, set up  in 2018, eventually published its influential Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (2019) , among other  documents.94  It must be noted that the moves towards a regulation of AI in the EU have taken place in parallel to  decisions aiming at supporting the development of AI, notably through investment and support  of research. Research co -funded by the AI has included controversial research such as the iBorderCtrl  project, encompassing automated deception detection.95 Another example of project known to  cause some concerns (eu -LISA 2020 18) is the Automatic Sentiment Analysis in the Wild (SEWA)  project,96 connected to the development of a predictive framework for ' continuous -time  prediction of dimensional affect or behavior  (e.g., valence/arousal, interest, conflict) '.97   3.4.4.  Towards a regulation on AI   The European Commissi on published its p roposal for a regulation  of the European Parliament and  of the Council laying down harmonised rules on AI (COM(2021) 206 final) on 21 April 2021.98 It is  based on Articles 16 and 114 of the TFEU, on personal data protection and the interna l market,  respectively.99 Article 16 of the TFEU is the relevant legal basis ' in as far ' are concerned rules on  restrictions of the use of AI systems for ' real-time'  remote biometric identification in publicly  accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement (COM(2021) 206 final 6)  and only to such  extent (Recital (2) of the proposed AIA).   It has been nevertheless described as putting forward a certification system primarily inspired in  product safety regimes (Matus and Veale 2021).  The proposed AI regulation  prohibits the use of some AI systems  (listed in the proposed Article 5),  and qualifies other as 'high-risk ', detailing the rules applicable to such 'high -risk' systems. Some  high -risk systems are to be classified as such because of their connection with safety issues (under                                                                  94 Can also be mentioned its Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI), which does not explicitly mention biometrics but  includes a couple of references to the processing of special categories of data , to be taken into account under the  ‘privacy and data governance’ requirement (AI HLEG 2020 12 -13).   95 More information: https://www.iborderctrl.eu/ . For an analysis, see notably: Penner 2019 36-38; Sánchez -Moned ero and  Dencik 2020 .  96 More information: https://www.sewaproject.eu/ .   97 More information: https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/continuous -time-prediction -behavior -affect/ .   98 This cons titutes a first step in a broader movement to be followed by a proposal on liability issues by the end of 2021 or  beginning of 2022 ( SWD(2021) 84 final . Part 1/2 9).   99 According to the Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal for the Regulation on AI, Art. 16 TFEU had to be used  as a legal basis because ' this Regulation contains certain specific rules, unrelated to the functioning of the internal market,  restric ting the use of AI systems for ‘real -time’ remote biometric identification by the law enforcement authorities of the  Member States, which necessarily limits the processing of biometric data by those authorities'  (SWD(2021) 84 final Part 1/2  31). 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      42 the proposed Article 6(a)). Others shall be regarded as high -risk because they are listed in the  proposed Annex III to the regulation .  High risk systems   Annex III lists the areas that allow to determine which systems are to be regarded as 'high risk'  for  the purposes of the proposed AI regulation , and under each area one or more types of AI systems  qualifying as high risk are mentioned. The first identified area is biometric identification and  categorisation of natural persons. Under this heading (heading 1), only a concrete group of AI  systems are mentioned , however : 'AI systems intended to be used for the 'real -time ' and 'post '  remote biom etric identification of natural persons '. There is, however, no reference to biometric  categorisation  being recognised as 'high risk' , despite the reference on the heading 's title.   According to the Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal for the regula tion  on AI, allowing  certain uses of remote biometric identification while considering them high risk ' because they pose  significant risks to fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals or whole groups thereof ' would  be 'overall consistent  with the EP [European Parliament]  position in its resolution on the ethics of  AI that the use and gathering of biometric data by private entities for remote identification purposes  in public areas, such as biometric or facial recognition, would not be all owed ' (SWD(2021) 84 final  Part 1/2 45).  Other areas mentioned as involving the qualification of an AI system as high risk are management  and operation of critical infrastructure , educational  and vocational training ; employment ,  workers management and acces s to self -employment; access to and enjoyment of essential private  services  and public services  and benefits; law enforcement ; migration, asylum  and border  control management ; administration of justice  and democratic processes .  Potentially, in any of these areas it is possible to imagine there might exist AI systems that involve  the processing of biometric data , for instance consisting in facial recognition  or so- called emotion  recognition . There are in addition some references i n some sub -headings to AI systems that appear  to be directly related to either categorisation or emotion recognition.   Under heading 4, ' Employment , workers management and access to self -employment' , there is a  reference to:   - '(a) AI systems intended to be used for recruitment or selection of natural  persons, notably for advertising vacancies, screening or filtering applications,  evaluating candidates  in the course of interviews or tests. '  - '(b) AI intended to be used for making decisions on promotion and ter mination  of work -related contractual relationships, for task allocation and for monitoring  and evaluating performance and behavior of persons in such relationships. '  Under heading 5, ' Access to and enjoyment of essential private services  and public service s and  benefits ', there is a reference to:   '(a) AI systems intended to be used by public authorities or on behalf of public authorities to  evaluate the eligibility of natural persons for public assistance benefits and services , as  well as to grant, reduce, revoke, or reclaim such benefits and services. '  Under heading 6, on ' Law enforcement ', are mentioned:   '(b) AI systems intended to be used by law enforcement authorities as polygraphs and similar  tools  or to detect the emotional state  of a natural person' . This could relate to ' emotion  recognition.'   '(e) AI systems intended to be used by law enforcement authorities for predicting the  occurrence or reoccurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence  based on profiling of 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      43 natural persons as referred to in Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 or assessing personality  traits and characteristics or past criminal behaviour of natural persons or groups. '  '(f) AI systems intended to be used by law enforcement authorities for profiling of natural  persons as ref erred to in Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 in the course of detection,  investigation or prosecution of criminal offences. '  '(g) AI systems intended to be used for crime analytics  regarding natural persons, allowing law  enforcement authorities to s earch complex related and unrelated large data sets available in  different data sources or in different data formats in order to identify unknown patterns or  discover hidden relationships in the data. '  Under heading 7, on ' Migration,  asylum and border cont rol management' , stand out:   '(a) AI systems intended to be used by competent public authorities as polygraphs and similar  tools  or to detect the emotional state  of a natural person; '  'd) AI systems intended to assist competent public authorities for the examination of  applications for asylum, visa and residence permits and associated complaints with  regard to the eligibility  of the natural persons applying for a status. '  Under heading 8, on ' Administration of  justice  and democratic processes ', are mention ed:  '(a) AI systems intended to assist a judicial authority in researching and interpreting facts and  the law and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts. '  The proposal foresees that Annex III might be amended by the European Commission via delegated  acts (proposed Article 7(1) AIA). The European Commission would be able to add new categories  of systems to be considered ' high-risk ' as long as they are intended to be used in one of the areas  already listed in Annex III, and if:   'the AI systems pose a risk of harm to the health and safety, or a risk of adverse impact on  fundamental rights, that is, in respect of its severity and probability of occurrence, equivalent  to or greater  than the risk of harm or of adverse impact posed by the high- risk AI syste ms  already referred to in Annex III ' (proposed Article 7(1)(b)).   In practice, this means that, in relation to fundamental rights,100 in the future might only be added  to the list of high- risk systems those that the European Commission considers as having an adverse  impact on fundamental rights equivalent to or greater  than those already listed. This  immediately triggers the question on how such an adverse impact could be measured  and  compared .  In this sense, the proposal clarifies that when making such an ass essment, the European  Commission shall take into account a series of criteria, listed in the proposed Article 7(2):   '(a) the intended purpose of the AI system;   (b) the extent to which an AI system has been used or is likely to be used;   (c) the extent to which the use of an AI system has already caused harm to the health and safety  or adverse impact on the fundamental rights  or has given rise to significant concerns in  relation to the materialisation of such harm or adverse impact, as demonstrated by reports or  documented allegations submitted to national competent authorities;   (d) the potential extent of such harm or such adverse impact, in particular in terms of its  intensity and its ability to affect a plurality  of persons;                                                                   100 In light  of the focus of this study, references to safety harms are not directly discussed here.  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      44 (e) the extent to which potentially harmed or adversely impacted persons are dependent  on  the outcome produced with an AI system, in particular because for practical or legal reasons it is  not reasonably possible to opt -out from that outcome;   (f) the exte nt to which potentially harmed or adversely impacted persons are in a vulnerable  position  in relation to the user of an AI system, in particular due to an imbalance of power,  knowledge, economic or social circumstances, or age;   (g) the extent to which the outcome produced with an AI system is easily reversible, whereby  outcomes having an impact on the health or safety of persons shall not be considered as easily reversible;   (h) the extent to which existing Union legislation provides for:   (i) effective me asures of redress in relation to the risks posed by an AI system, with the exclusion  of claims for damages;   (ii) effective measures to prevent or substantially minimise those risks .'  It is not completely clear what such 'taking into account'  of all these criteria is expected to imply   in practice. For instance, in relation to the criterion related to 'the extent to which an AI system has  been used ' (proposed Article 7(2)(b) AIA), it could be interpreted that if a system has already been  used t o some extent, it was because it did not have an adverse impact, but this might also not be  the case.   The proposed Article 7(2)(c) AIA refers to the need to take into account already materialised adverse  impact on fundamental rights, as well as significati on concerns in relation to such materialisation,  but only to the extent these have been ' demonstrated by reports or documented allegations  submitted to national competent authorities ', without specifying how or by whom, or at which  moment the European Commission would be legally obliged to take into account such submitted evidence.   AI systems qualifying as high risk systems shall in any case, in line with the proposal, comply with  the requirements listed in its Chapter 2 , which concern: a risk management sy stem (proposed  Article 9 AIA), rules on data training, validation and testing (proposed Article 10 AIA), technical documentation (proposed Article 11 AIA), record keeping (proposed Article 12 AIA), transparency  and provision of information to users (proposed Article 13 AIA), human oversight (proposed Article  14 AIA), and on accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity (proposed Article 15 AIA).  The required risk management system  is described in the proposed Article 9 AIA, which notes that  it 'shall consist of a continuous iterative process run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high- risk AI  system, requiring regular systematic updating ', necessarily include testing prior to the placing on  the market or the putting into service, and notably comprise four steps:   '(a) identification and analysis of the known and foreseeable risks  associated with each highrisk AI system;   (b) estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge  when the high- risk AI system is used  in accordance with its intended purpose  and under  conditions of reasonably foreseeable  misuse ;   (c) evaluation of other possibly arising risks based on the analysis of data gathered from the  post -market monitoring system referred to in Article 61;   (d) adoption of suitable risk management measures in acc ordance with the provisions of the  following paragraphs ' (proposed Article 9(2) AIA).   The proposed Article 10 AIA details the data -related requirements applicable to high- risk systems  which make use of techniques involving the training of models with data,  under the heading data 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      45 and data governance. These are particularly relevant from a fundamental rights perspective insofar  as they directly concern issues related to risk of bias. In line with the proposed text, and specifically  the proposed Article 10 AIA , for the mentioned systems the training, validation and testing data sets  shall:   - 'be subject to appropriate data governance and management practices ', inter alia  concerning 'examination in view of possible biases ', as well as 'the identification of any  possible data gaps or shortcomings, and how those gaps and shortcomings can be  addressed' ;  - 'be relevant, representative, free of errors and complete' , and ' have the appropriate  statistical properties, including, where applicable, as regards the persons or groups of  persons on which the high- risk AI system is intended to be used '; and   - 'take into account, to the extent required by the intended purpose, the characteristics or  elements that are particular to the specific geographical, behavioural or functional setting  within which the high-  risk AI system is intended to be used '.  The same provision foresees that exceptionally and to the extent that ' it is strictly necessary for the  purposes of ensuring bias monitoring, detection and correction in relation to the high -risk AI  systems ', the providers of such systems may process special categories of personal data, subject to  appropriate safeguards (proposed Article 10(5)(g) AIA). There are no specific safeguards detailed in  this context.   Chapter 3 of the proposed regulation  describes among others the obligations of providers  of high risk AI systems. Providers are responsible for ensuring that their high -risk AI systems are compliant  with the requirements set out in Chapter 2, but have also other obligations, such as  affixing a CE  marking  to their high- risk AI systems to indicate the conformity with the regulation  (proposed  Article 16 AIA). They must also put a quality management system  in place (proposed Article 17  AIA), draw up the technical documentation (proposed Article 18 AIA), ensure that their systems  undergo the relevant conformity assessment procedure (proposed Article 19 AIA),101 keep the  automatically generated  logs (proposed Article 20 AIA), take appropriate corrective measures   when they consider or have rea son to consider that a high- risk AI system which they have placed on  the market or put into service is not in conformity with the regulation  (proposed Article 21 AIA),  comply with a duty of information if the system presents a risk within the meaning of the  proposed Article 65(1)  of the proposed AIA (proposed Article 22 AIA), and, upon request by a  national competent authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation  necessary to demonstrate the conformity (proposed Article 23 AIA) .  The obligations of users102 of high -risk systems are described in the proposed Article 29 AIA, and  they include using the systems in accordance with the accompanying instructions, ensuring that input data is relevant in view of the intended purpose, and mo nitoring the operation of the system  on the basis of the instructions of use. When the users have reasons to consider that the use in  accordance with the instructions of use may result in the AI system presenting a risk within the meaning of the proposed A rticle 65(1), or if they when they have identified any serious incident  or any malfunctioning within the meaning of the proposed Article 62, they shall inform the provider  or distributor and suspend the use of the system.                                                                   101 Special rules regarding this conformity assessment procedure apply to ' AI systems intended to be used for the ‘real -time’  and ‘post’ remote biometric identification of natural persons ' (cf. proposed Art. 43(1) AIA).   102 In the proposed AIA, ‘users’ are defined as ' any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body using an AI  system under its territory, except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non -professional activity ' (proposed  Art. 3(4) AIA).  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      46 According to the Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal for the regulation  on AI, it is  possible to impose further obligations on users ' because users are already bound by the  fundamental rights legislation in place ' (SWD(2021) 84 final Part 1/2 57).   Title VIII of the proposed regula tion  on AI describes measures for post -market monitoring,  information sharing and market surveillance. Particularly relevant is the proposed Article 62, on the  'reporting of serious incidents and of malfunctioning ', which establishes that providers of highrisk AI systems placed on the EU market ' shall report any serious incident or any malfunctioning of  those systems which constitutes a breach of obligations under Union law intended to protect fundamental rights  to the market surveillance authorities of the Member States where that  incident or breach occurred '. The notified market surveillance authority shall inform the competent  national public authorities or bodies.   The proposed Article 65 describes the procedure in place for AI systems regarded as presenting a risk at national level insofar as risk to the health or safety or to the protection of fundamental rights  of persons are concerned, if the risk, as established by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, is of ' a degree  which goes beyond that considered reasonab le and acceptable in relation to its intended purpose  or under the normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use of the product concerned '. 103  Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reasons to consider that  an AI system presents such a risk, 'they shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in  respect of its compliance with all the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation' ; if  risks to the protection of fundamental rights are present, the market surveillance authority shall also inform the relevant national public authorities or bodies. A special procedure is set up for the cases  in which a market surveillance authority wou ld consider that non- compliance is not restricted to its  national territory, involving informing the European Commission and the other Member States  (proposed Article 65(3), and Article 66 AIA).   The evaluation carried out by the national market surveillance might result in determining that  although the AI system is in compliance with the regulation , 'it presents a risk  to the health or safety  of persons, to the compliance with obligations under Un ion or national law intended to protect  fundamental rights  or to other aspects of public interest protection'  (proposed Article 67(1) AIA).  In such a case, the market authority it shall require the relevant operator 'to take all appropriate  measures to ens ure that the AI system concerned, when placed on the market or put into service,  no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the AI system from the market or to recall it within a  reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk ' (idem). The Europ ean Commission  and other Member States shall be informed about these corrective measures, with the former being  able to adopt a final decision on whether they are appropriate measures, according to the proposed  draft (proposed Article 67(5) AIA).   The existence of these measures is important, as experts have stressed that it is very difficult for  developers and providers of AI systems to fully ascertain ' the real -world impacts of any given AI  application prospectively' , noting it 'is hard enough to predict what human rights impacts a  relatively anodyne product will have when it is released into the marketplace, hence the challenge of assessing the human rights impacts of AI systems before they are deployed is all the more considerable ' (Raso et al. 54). 104                                                                  103 See Art. 3(19) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market  surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42 /EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and  (EU) No 305/2011, OJ L 169, 25.6.2019, p. 1–44.  104 The authors evoke in this sense the controversy around report s that the  US government used facial recognition  technology supplied by Microsoft in implementing a policy of separating the children of unlawful migrants from their  parents , to which the company reacted expressing dismay (Shu 2019).  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      47 Real -time remote biometric identification for law enforcement in public spaces   The AI regulation  proposed by the European Commission foresees, as a general principle, ' the  prohibition of the use of 'real -time ' remote biometric identification systems in publicl y  accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement ' (proposed Article 1(d) AIA).105  Nevertheless, such real -time remote biometric identification systems can be used  'as far as such use  is strictly necessary for one of the following objectives:   '(i) the targeted search for specific potential victims of crime, including missing children;   (ii) the prevention of a specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of  natural persons or of a terrorist attack;   (iii) the detectio n, localisation, identification or prosecution of a perpetrator or suspect of a  criminal offence referred to in Article 2(2) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA and punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention orde r for a  maximum period of at least three years, as determined by the law of that Member State'   (proposed Article 1(d)(i -iii) AIA).   To understand the scope of the proposed rules on real -time remote biometric identification  systems, a series of definitions i n the proposal are pertinent, in addition to the definition of remote  biometric identification system already commented. First, ' real -time ' remote biometric  identification systems are defined as meaning ' a remote biometric identification system whereby  the capturing of biometric data, the comparison and the identification all occur without a significant  delay ', which 'comprises not only instant identification, but also limited short delays in order to avoid  circumvention ' (proposed Article 3(37) AIA). Real -time remote biometric identification systems are  opposed to ' post ' remote biometric identification systems, which are the systems other than real time (idem).   Second, a ' publicly accessible space ' is defined as ' any physical place accessible to the public ,  regardless of whether certain conditions for access may apply ' (proposed Article 3(39) AIA). Third,  'law enforcement ' is defined in the proposal as ' activities carried out by law enforcement  authorities for the prevention, investigation, detection or pro secution of criminal offences or the  execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to  public security ' (proposed Article 1(40) AIA).   All these elements are important, as what the proposed regulation  prohi bits in principle –  but allows  under certain conditions - are real -time remote biometric identification systems in publicly  accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement . In contrast, all other AI systems intended  to be used for the ' real- time'  and 'post ' remote biometric identification of natural persons, for the  purposes of law enforcement or not, are regulated as high- risk AI systems (Annex III, point 1(a)).  The foreseen conditions allowing for the use of real -time remote biometric identification systems in  publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement include the mentioned requirement  of strict necessity  for one of the specific mentioned objectives, but also additional requirements .                                                                      105 This prohibition notably derives from the fact that other options are described in the Impact Assessment accompanying  the pr oposal for the Regulation on AI as insufficient. In this sense, the document notes that ' not to impose any further  restrictions on the use of remote biometric identification in publicly accessible places and apply only the requirements for  Trustworthy AI ' was a policy choice that was ' discarded as it would not effectively address the high risks to fundamental  rights posed by these systems and the current potential for their arbitrary abuse witho without an effective oversight mechanism and limitations on t he permitted use'  (SWD(2021) 84 final Part 1/2 46).  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      48 The proposal states that their use ' shall tak e into account the following elements:   (a) the nature of the situation giving rise to the possible use, in particular the seriousness,  probability and scale of the harm caused in the absence of the use of the system;   (b) the consequences of the use of th e system for the rights and freedoms of all  persons  concerned, in particular the seriousness, probability and scale of those consequences '  (COM(2021) 206 final 44).   The text does not specify what is expected exactly from this ' taking into account'  of the  mentioned elements. They are potentially to be taken into account when deciding of the strict  necessity of the use of the mentioned systems. They represent what could be described as an  invitation to balance , on the one hand, the risks in terms of harm connected to the possible nonuse of the system, and, on the other, the risks for fundamental rights and freedoms connected to  the possible use of the system.   The use of real -time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces f or the  purpose of law enforcement must in any case ' comply with necessary and proportionate safeguards  and conditions in relation to the use, in particular as regards the temporal , geographic  and  personal limitations ' (proposed Article 5(2) AIA). This requ irement refers to the need for  accompanying safeguards but also to the need to limit the use of these systems to what is strictly  necessary, notably by preventing unlimited and indiscriminate uses of real -time remote biometric  identification in public spac es for law enforcement purposes.   The proposed Article 5(3) AIA puts forward that each individual use for the purpose of law  enforcement of a 'real- time'  remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces  'shall be subject to a prior authorisation granted by a judicial authority  or by an independent  administrative authority of the Member State in which the use is to take place' , issued upon a  reasoned request and in accordance with rules of national law as referred to in the proposed Articl e  5(4) AIA.   Despite such general requirement of prior judicial authorisation, however, ' in a duly justified  situation of urgency, the use of the system may be commenced without an authorisation and the  authorisation may be requested only during or after the use'  (proposed Article 5(3) AIA). The  proposal does not specify what happens if the use already took place, and judicial authorisation is  eventually denied.   The proposed Article 5(4) AIA states that it is up to Member States to decide to provide –  or no t - for  the possibility  to fully or partially authorise the use of ' real -time ' remote biometric  identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement ,  always within the limits and under the conditions specified above. The text clarifies that when doing  so Member State shall lay down in their national law ' the necessary detailed rules for the request,  issuance and exercise of, as well as supervision relating to ' the mentioned judicial authorisations,  and that the national ru les shall also specify in respect of which of the objectives listed, including in  respect of which criminal offences, the competent authorities may be authorised to use those  systems for the purpose of law enforcement (proposed Article 5(4) AIA).   Regarding 'post ' remote biometric identification, which would fall in principle under 'high -risk'  activity (proposed Article 6 (2) AIA), a requirement that any identification resulting from the system  must be verified and confirmed by two natural persons (proposed Article 14) before any decision is  taken would apply (Kind 2021).   According to the Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal for the regulation  on AI, it was  notably some Member States including France, Finland, the Czech Republic and Denmark that  submit ted that the use of remote biometric identification systems in public spaces might be  justified  in certain cases, for important public security reasons under strict legal conditions and 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      49 safeguards, in response to the European Commission' s consultation on its White Paper on AI  (SWD(2021) 84 final Part 1/2 18).  Transparency obligations and their limitations   The proposed AI regulation  foresees special transparency obligations  for providers of certain AI  systems. In this sense, providers shall ensure ' that AI systems intended to interact with natural  persons are designed and developed in such a way that natural persons are informed that they are  interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the circumstances and the context of use '  (proposed Articl e 52(1) AIA). Thus, such transparency obligations apply to providers of any AI  systems intended to interact with natural persons . Exceptionally, these obligations ' shall not  apply to AI systems authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecut e criminal  offences, unless those systems are available for the public to report a criminal offence'  (idem).   In addition, the proposed regulation  establishes that that the users of emotion recognition   systems  and biometric categorisation systems  'shall inform of the operation of the system the  natural persons exposed thereto ' (proposed Article 52(2) AIA).106 Thus, these transparency  obligations apply to users (as opposed to providers), but only to users of emotion recognition  systems and of biometric categ orisation systems. These obligations do not apply to 'AI systems used  for biometric categorisation, which are permitted by law to detect, prevent and investigate criminal  offences ' (idem).   It has been noted that police use of biometric categorisation for p urposes other than  identification does not even appear to be classified as a high -risk use of biometrics, as biometric  identification and categorisation systems only fall into the high- risk category when they are used  for 'biometric identification'  (Kind 2 021).  Exclusion of AI systems in EU large scale databases   The proposed regulation  on AI is generally to apply, according to the proposal of the European  Commission, to the high- risk AI systems that have been placed on the market or put into service  before the date of application of this regulation  'only if, from that date, those systems are subject to  significant changes in their design or intended purpose ' (proposed Article 83(2) AIA).   Nevertheless, the proposal states that the regulation  shall not apply at all  – that is, none of its  provisions would apply - to the AI systems which are part of the large- scale IT systems established  by the legal acts listed in its Annex IX that have been placed on the market or put into service within  the f irst year of application of the regulation  (proposed Article 83(1) AIA). The legal acts listed in  Annex IX refer to the Schengen Information System (SIS), the Visa Information System (VIS), Eurodac,  the Entry/Exit System, the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), the  European Criminal Records Information System on third -country nationals and stateless persons  (ECRIS -TCN), and their Interoperability.   Only exceptionally , if the replacement or amendment of the legal acts establishing these large scale IT systems leads to a significant change in the design or intended purpose of the AI system or  AI systems concerned, the regulation  would apply to such AI systems. Nevertheless, the proposal  states that the regulation 's requirements 'shall be taken into account, where applicable , in the  evaluation of each large -scale IT systems established by the legal acts listed in Annex IX to be  undertaken as provided for in those respective acts ' (idem).   All the mentioned IT systems are managed or to be managed by eu-LISA , an agency that has openly  endorsed a great interest in AI. A 2020 report of the Agency, for instance, notably suggested that AI  could be used introduced in ETIAS to assist the humans who have to review manually decisions                                                                  106 There is also a provision for users of ‘deep fakes’ (proposed Article 52(3) AIA).  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      50 labelled as su ch by the system, claiming that such ' system could support case officers responsible  for evaluating applications with additional risk assessment based on the data stored in the relevant  systems and the historical data on the individual submitting the appli cation ' (eu-LISA 2020 30). The  idea could potentially fundamentally undermine the safeguards against automated decision making foreseen for ETIAS, as precisely the ' human in the loop ' is supposed to bring in a manual  consideration of the decision, not an a dditional automated decision.   On impact assessments  The need for impact assessments is often put forward when discussing the regulation of AI, also in  relation to biometrics. In the proposed regulation  on AI can be identified several instances in which  it might be appropriate to integrate insights from some type of impact assessments. It is the case,  for instance, of the obligation imposed on the European Commission to take into account the  adverse impact on the fundamental rights of AI systems to be potentially added to the list of high risk systems.   Some have suggested that all agencies wishing to deploy facial recognition should be obliged to  carry out a formal algorithmic impact assessment , which would be '[m]odelled after impact assessment frameworks fo r human rights, environmental protection and data protection' , and  'guarantee public input ' (Crawford 2019).107 The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights put forward its  own list of selected elements that in its view could be incorporated into fundamental rights impact  assessments carried out before using any AI -driven systems (FRA 2020(c) 96 and ff.).   The Guidelines on Facial Recognition of the Consultative Committee of Convention 108 stress that  '[e]ntities using facial recognition technologies have to carry out  impact assessments before the  processing as the use of these technologies involves biometric data processing and presents high  risks to the fundamental rights of data subjects ' (T-PD(2020)03rev4 14). The Consultative Committee  nevertheless refers to such impact assessments as data protection impact assessments , which  appears to imply they are not as such a specific type of impact assessment. What is worthwhile  noting is that the Guidelines state that ' [a]fter completion of this assessment, entities should publish  it to receive views from the public on the potential deployment of facial recognition technologies '  (idem). This can be regarded as a positive step for integrating the views of the public, although it could be questioned whether it would be prefera ble to integrate such views not after the  completion of the impact assessment, but rather while carrying it out.   The impact assessment accompanying the proposal for a regulation  on AI explicitly mentions that  it would be possible to require insofar as for high -risk AI systems with fundamental rights  implications are concerned ' fundamental rights impact assessments / algorithmic impact   assessments  as implemented in Canada and the U.S. and recommended by some stakeholders, the  Council of Europe or the Europe and the Fundamental Rights Agency ' (SWD(2021) 84 final Part 1/2  58-59). Nevertheless, the document points out that this possibility was this was:   'discarded, because users of high- risk AI systems would normally be obliged to do a Data  Protection Impact Ass essment (DPIA) that already aims to protect a range of fundamental  rights of natural persons and which could be interpreted broadly, so new regulatory obligation  was considered unnecessary ' (ibid. 59).   Indeed, it is possible that a certain assessment of AI  systems involving biometrics might have to  occur before their use in the context of data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) – that is, an  assessment of impact as regulated by EU data protection law.108 The GDPR foresees that ' [w]here a                                                                  107 Also concluding that ' [p]olicymakers should ensure that biometric programmes undergo thorough and transparent civil  rights assessment prior to implementation ': EC Directorate-General for Research and Innovation 2020 146.  108 Data protection impact assessments are also currently required outside of the UE. In this context, the ICO has provided  detailed guidance on ‘Expectati ons on data protection impact assessments for live facial recognition in public places’, 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      51 type of processing  in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope,  context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms  of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry  out an assessment of the  impact  of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data '.109 A DPIA shall  'in particular ', as detailed in Article 35(3) GDPR, be required in the case of:   '(a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons   which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based  that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the  natural person;   (b) processing on a  large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1), or of  personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10; or   (c) a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale .'  These three requirements are potentially pertinent in relation to AI systems involving biometrics, in  particular those deployed in public spaces. The requirement of Article 35(3)(a) GDPR will apply if the  system involves ' a systematic and extensive evalu ation of personal aspects (...) based on automated  processing ', as long as such system produces legal effects or similarly affects individuals; Article  35(3)(b) GDPR will apply if the processing of biometric data takes place ' on a large scale '; and Article   35(3)(c) GDPR concerns the large scale and systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas.   Under Article 35(4) GDPR, national supervisory authorities shall establish lists of the kind of  processing operations that are in all cases subject to the requi rement of a DPIA, and they must  communicate such lists to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).110  An important source of knowledge on the relation between DPIAs and biometrics -driven AI are the  opinions of the EDPB on the draft lists submitted to it by  national supervisory authorities regarding  the processing operations which are to be subject to the requirement of a DPIA under Article 35(4) GDPR. In compliance with Article 64(1) GDPR, the EDPB must issue an opinion where a supervisory  authority (SA) in tends to adopt such a list of processing operations, in view of creating a harmonised  approach with regard to processing that is cross border or that can affect the free flow of personal  data or natural person across the EU, despite the fact that the GDPR does not impose a single, EU wide list.                                                                      which can be read as partially overlaping with some requirements foreseen under the proposed Regulation on AI  (ICO  56).  109 Data protection impact assessments are also f oreseen under the LED, which notes that ' [w]here a type of processing, in  particular, using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing is  likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons, Member States shall provide for the controller to  carry out, prior to the processing, an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of  personal data' , and that t he assessment ' shall contain at least a general description of the envisaged processing  operations, an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the measures envisaged to address those  risks, safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Directive, taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of the data subjects and other person s  concerned ' (Art. 27 LED). See also Art. 39 of the EU DP Regulation.  110 Art. 35(4) GDPR states: ' The  supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations  which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists  to the Board referred to in Article 68. ' 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      52 The analysis of such opinions allows to identify the following points:   • According to the EDPB  – and despite prior pointers in a different sense,111 the processing of  biometric data is not necessarily likely to represent a high risk per se.112 Thus, the  processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person  requires a DPIA to be carried out only when it is done in conjunction with at least one other  criterion, without prejudice to Art . 35(3) GDPR (Gellert 2018 503). It is however appropriate  for supervisory authorities to state that when such processing takes place ' in conjunction  with one other criterion' , a DPIA must be carried out (EDPB, Opinion 26/2018 6).  • Equally, 'processing acti vities that consist of or include regular and systematic monitoring  of publicly accessible areas are not necessarily likely to represent a high  risk ', although,  in conjunction with at least one other criterion, such processing is likely to present a high  risk and requires a DPIA to be carried out (EDPB, Opinion 26/2018 6). Such one other  qualifying criterion should not be however that the data are stored (idem).   • In a similar vein, the EDPB opposed the view that personal data processing 'using new or  innovative technology'  should immediately trigger the need to carry out a DPIA, noting  that this should only be the case when such processing is done in conjunction of at least  one other criterion (EDPB, Opinion 21/2018 8).                                                                     111 In 2017, the Art. 29 Working Party had stated that ‘the processing of any type of biometric data (…) could (…) be  considered as relevant for the development of a list pursuant to article 35(4)’ (Art. 29 WP, WP 24 8 rev.01 12).   112 See, in this sense, for instance: EDPB, Opinions 9/2018 and 26/2018.   
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      53 4. Policy options   In light of the analysis carried out and the described findings, the following policy options are put  forward.  They do not exclude, but complement each other.   Policy option 1. Better delimiting the regulation of biometrics  There exists no general definition of biometrics  or biometric data  in EU law. The proposal for a  regulation  on AI published by the European Commission reproduces the definition of biometric  data  emanating from EU data protection law.   This  definition of biometric data supports a  rather  narrow approach to biometric data , qualifying  as such only the personal data that allow or confirm the unique identification of a person  through  a specific technical processing . The definition is also not particularly clear  (Jasserand -Breeman 2019  163), as there are for inst ance  uncertainties as to what such specific technical processing means , or  how the data 's ability to allow or confirm the unique identification of a person differs –  if it does –   from the requirement of processing such data ' for the purpose of uniquely ide ntifying a natural  person ', which accompanies the reference to biometric data in the provisions about the processing  of special categories of data.   The rather narrow nature of EU data protection law' s view contrasts with the broader understanding  of biomet rics encountered in much of the literature and in  some  policy documents. Generally  speaking, there is a concern with AI systems that rely on the processing of data related to the  body , data that might not necessarily always fall under the current definition of biometric data.   As a consequence, and to the extent that the current definition of biometric data in EU data  protection law would be merely reproduced in other, upcoming  legal instruments, certain practices,  albeit presenti ng serious risks for fundamental rights, might not be adequately regulated –  for  instance if the proposed AI regulation  is adopted with the current definitions of biometric  categorisation and emotion recognition, the scope of which is conditioned to the pr ocessing of  biometric data, and the meaning of which is  thus  indirectly circumscribed by the described  narrow and not fully clear definition of biometric data .  The ambiguities surrounding the very notion of biometric data  are perceptible in the call of the   EDPB and the EDPS , in their Joint Opinion on the proposed regulation  of AI , to ban certain uses of  AI 'for an automated recognition of human features  in publicly accessible spaces ' (Joint Opinion  5/2021 11) The EDPB and the EDPS call indeed 'for a general  ban on any use of AI for an automated  recognition of human features in publicly accessible spaces -  such as of faces but also of gait,  fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavio ural signals ' (ibid.), a formulation  in which transpi re numerous terminological uncertainties. The sentence for instance appears to  imply that ' biometric ' and 'behavioural signals ' would be something different, despite the fact that  EU data protection law defines biometric data as encompassing data about the behavioural  characteristics of natural persons. Also, the call refers to generally banning the recognition of   human features , but still only provides examples that could be regarded as  clearly potentially  falling under biometric data.   Using in the future AI regulation  the same definition of biometric data as in existing EU data  protection law instruments has certainly the advantage of potentially facilitating consistency . If the  definition in the European C ommiss ion's proposal is not revised, at least further clarity should be  urgently provided, for instance through unambiguous guidance from the EDPB on how to interpret the definition and how to apply it to the most controversial and recurrent AI scenarios. In this  context, in July 2021 the EDPB published a  final version  of its Guidelines on virtual voice assistants, in  which is stated that ' voice data is inherently biometric personal data ' (Guidelines 02/2021 13). It 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      54 is very  unclear what ' inherently biometric personal data ' mean, and whether voice is the only type  of such data, or which biometric data would be biometric data but not 'inherently biometric  personal data' .  In addition, special care has to be given to the implications of referring to the notion of biometric  data in other legal definitions.   Policy option 2: Improve the future qualification of AI systems as  high- risk  The procedure foreseen in the proposed AI regulation  to add types of AI systems to the list of AI  systems regarded as ' high risk'  gives a prominent ro le to the European Commission, without  detailing with sufficient clarity how such a procedure will unfold, how to initiate it or request its  launch, or how long it could take.  Furthermore, the foreseen procedure rests on an ultimately  subjective appreciation of whether the AI systems to be added to the list can have an equivalent or  greater adverse impact on fundamental rights  compared to the adverse impact initially included  in the list.   In their Joint Opinion o n the proposed regulation  on AI, the EDPB and the EDPS have stressed that  already the proposal on the table appears to miss –  and may problematic ally fail – to qualify as high risk some systems  which involve significant risks, and that in any case the rele vant 'annexes will need  to be regularly updated to ensure that their scope is appropriate'  (Joint Opinion 5/2021 9).  In order to prevent the irreparable materialisation of an adverse impact on fundamental rights, it is  crucial to design a robust and open s ystem for the inclusion of new categories of AI systems in the  list of high -risk systems. In particular, c ompared to the procedures in place for reacting when a user  perceives a significant problem with a system already falling under a high- risk category, the  procedure to add new types of systems to the list of high- risk AI systems is particularly weak.   It appears thus necessary to foresee a faster , clearer and accessible path  to qualify additional AI  systems as high -risk systems.   Additional transparency re quirements on the use of AI systems would  facilitate the monitoring of  the risk of relevant adverse impact. Moreover, civil society organisations  could be given a role to  raise the alarm of major risks, especially insofar as the affected persons would  pote ntially be in  vulnerable positions, and  might not be able to easily document and communicate harms by  themselves.   Policy option 3: Explicitly ban certain uses of live facial recognition   The proposed AI regulation  fails to effectively prohibit real- time remote biometric identification in  public spaces for law enforcement purposes, even if it uses words  that hint in such a direction. What  it provides for is actually a framework to allow for the widespread use of such AI systems, in a  manner that mirrors fo r instance the prohibition in the GDPR of the processing of special categories  of data, processing that is nevertheless permitted under certain conditions.   This approach does not effectively prevent the serious adverse impact that can stem from the  deploym ent in Europe of an infrastructure allowing for the recurrent  – even if recurrently short term – authorisation of  remote biometric identification in public spaces for law enforcement  purposes.   In particular, t he persistent tracking  of individuals in public  spaces by means of remote  biometric identification, be it or not for law enfor cement purposes, must be explicitly and  unambiguously prohibited, as it has major consequences for fundamental rights and democracy as  such.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      55 Policy option 4: Regulate  'post'  rem ote biometric identification as  the 'live' version   In relation to remote biometric identification, the proposed AI regulation  fails to properly address  the risks connected to  the retroactive identification with facial recognition of individuals whose  images have been recorded while they were in public spaces. Indeed, the proposed regulation  does  not even formally prohibit the ' post ' remote biometric identification of natural persons , which  is deemed as falling under the high- risk category  of AI systems, and thus potentially subject to  certification.  In practice, the  risk of persistent tracking and its associated adverse impact on fundamental  rights and democracy  are, however, at least equivalent. As the imag es potentially available for  'post ' remote biometric identification of natural persons are actually more numerous than those  available at any point in time for real -time identification, they should  also make it possible to draw  a much more complete picture of the activities of any individual , thus representing a major  interference with their fundamental rights.   The weakness of the distinction between 'real- time'  and 'post ' might be best apprehended thinking  about access for law enforcement purposes to retai ned data in the context of the retention of data  processed by communication providers under data retention laws. Although it is undisputed that  real- time surveillance of communications constitutes an interference with fundamental rights that  requires in principle, as a safeguard, a specific authorisation,  the same applies to access to data  that have been stored .113   'Post ' remote biometric identification of natural persons recorded while in public spaces should  be  accompanied by  the same safeguards as the ' real-time'  equivalent  if permitted . Any permitted use  for law enforcement ' post ' remote biometric identification of natural persons recorded while in  public spaces sh ould  be made dependent on a prior review carried out by a  court or by an  independent administrative body  whose decision seeks to limit access to the data and their use  to what is strictly necessary for the purpose of attaining the objective pursued.  This would be in line  with the European Parliament' s call to generally subject to judicial review the use of facial  recognition by public authorities (P9_TA(2020)0275 § 65).  The EDPB and the EDPS have noted  that it is problematic to submit to  particularly less stringent rules  remote biometric identification systems in which the comparison of data and the identification all  occur with ' a significant delay' , observing that ' a mass identification system is able to identify  thousands of individuals in only a few hours ', and that ' the intrusiveness of the processing does not  always depend on the identification being done in real -time or not' , as ' post ' remote biometric  identification 'in the context of a political protest is likely to have a significant chilling effect on the  exercise of the fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of assembly and association and  more in general the founding principles of democracy ' (Joint Opinion 5/2021 11) . They have  described the approach of regulating differently such 'post ' remote biometric identification as  flawed  (ibid.).   Policy option 5: S afeguards for real- time remote biometric  identification   The proposed AI regulation  leaves in the hands of Member States to define, by law, the exact  conditions for the use of in principle prohibited but actually permitted real -time remote biometric  identification in pub lic spaces for law enforcement purposes. The proposed Article 5(2) AIA notes                                                                  113 Cf. for instance Digital Rights Ireland Ltd . (2014) CJEU Joined Cases C ‑293/12 and C‑594/12  ECLI:EU:C:2014:238. 
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      56 indeed that the use of ' real- time'  remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible  spaces for the purpose of law enforcement ' shall comply with necessary and propor tionate  safeguards and conditions in relation to the use, in particular as regards the temporal, geographic  and personal limitations ', but fails to specify such necessary and proportionate safeguards. The only  detailed condition is the need for prior autho risation granted by a judicial authority or by an  independent administrative authority (proposed Article 5(3) AIA).   The EDPB and the EDPS Joint Opinion on the proposed regulation  on AI underlines that the 'use of  AI in the area of police and law enforcement requires area-specific, precise, foreseeable and  proportionate rules  that need to consider the interests of the persons concerned and the effects  on the functioning of a democratic society ' (Joint Opinion 5/2021 9).  The Washington bill passed in 2020114, which, just like the proposed regulation , 'prohibits ' certain  uses of facial recognition while allowing them under certain conditions, is more specific in relation  to the substantial safeguards foreseen for such permitted uses than the proposal now on the table  of the EU legislator.   Experience has shown that,  when the EU legislator adopts legislation that establishes limitations of  fundamental rights while referring to necessary safeguards to be adopted later at national level,  serious problems can emerge. A  similar lack of specified safeguards led to the invalidation of the  Data Retention Directive115. More recently, the European Commission noted that some Member  States have used the freedom provided  to them by the GDPR (in its Article 23) to restrict data subject  rights in ways that do not adequately meet the conditions and safeguards required (SWD(2020) 115  final).   The EDPS has in the past consistently called for a  moratorium  on the deployment, in the EU, o f  'automated recognition in public spaces of human features, not only of faces but also of gait,  fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals, so that an informed  and democratic debate can take place and until the moment when the EU and Member States  have all the appropriate safeguards ' (EDPS 2020 2). That is, the EDPS call s for a moratorium giving  time for a democratic debate, but also to identify appropriate safeguards. As it stands, the proposed  AI regulation  cannot be deemed to guarantee appropriate safeguards.   Substantive safeguards for the prohibited but exceptionally permitted uses of real -time remote  biometric identification, if any, must be specified in the future AIA itself, as opposed to being left to  the discretion of the Member States.   Policy option 6: Ban AI systems assigning to categories that  constitute sensitive data based on biometric data   The proposed AI regulation  provides a definition of ' biometric categorisation system'  which is not  only unclear but also conceptually problematic , most notably to the extent that it seems to  endorse that it is possible –  scientifically, ethically, legally –  to use AI systems to assign natural  persons to a sexual orientation or to a political orientation. In doing so, t he proposal  opens the door  to the possible national certification in the EU of systems with potentially extremely dangerous impact. The definition should be thus revised  to remove the existing ambiguity in this sense.   If a reference to the use of similar  AI systems persist s in future versions of the proposal , it sh ould  be  phrased clearly as a prohibition.  This is also the message from the EDPB and the EDPS, wh o have  explicitly recommended ' a ban,  for both public authorities and private entities, on AI systems                                                                  114 SB 6280.  115 Digital Rights Ireland Ltd . (2014) CJEU Joined Cases C ‑293/12 and C‑594/12 ECLI:EU:C:2014:238.  
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      57 categorizing individuals from biometrics  (for instance, from face recognition) into clusters  according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation, or other grounds for  discrimination prohibited  under Article 21 of the Charter ' (Joint Opinion 5/2021 12).  The question of the definition of biometric  data is crucial to properly assess the potential impact of  such a ban on current and future problematic practices . It should be thus assessed whether certain  AI systems categorising individual s sh ould  be prohibited regardless of whether they categorise  on the basis of biometric data .  Policy option 7: Clarify the regulation of ' emotion recognition '  The status of ' emotion recognition'  in the proposal for a regulation  on AI is not entirely clear. The  definition of emotion recognition, as in the proposed Article 3(34) AIA, seems to imply that emotions  and intentions of individuals can be inferred from biometric data . This would only make sense –  provided that what is meant is that certain emotions  and intentions wi ll be attributed, regardless of  whether the individual de facto experienced or had them – if biometric data are understood in a  broad sense, not limited to data allowing for the unique identification of individuals.   In addition, the list of high -risk systems in Annex III includes various reference s to systems used ' to  detect the emotional state of a natural person ', without clarifying if these would correspond to  what is defined as 'emotion recognition'  systems or would potentially be something else or a  broader notion, possibly applying also in the absence of biometric data processing.   The EDPB and the EDPS have explicitly recommended that the future regulation  on AI should ban  'AI systems whose scientific validity is not proven or which a re in direct conflict with essential values  of the EU (e.g., polygraph  (...))' (Joint Opinion 5/2021 12). They have also stated that they 'consider  that the use of AI to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be  prohibited , except for certain well -specified use -cases, namely for health or research purposes '  (Joint Opinion 5/2021 12). This statement appears to refer to any use of AI to infer emotions, not  limited to biometric data.   Policy option 8: Increase transparency towards individuals   Generally speaking, the proposed AI regulation  privileges imposing obligations on actors other  than the users of AI systems, who are only subject to a limited number of provisions. For example,  in relation to bias detection, it is for the pro viders of AI systems to take in advance the necessary  measures on data governance, anticipating also risks associated with uses yet to be determined.   The use of extremely high -risk systems  in particular should be conditioned on additional  obligations imposed on users towards individuals , notably in terms of transparency both prior  to the use and during the use. Individuals should  indeed be able to access the relevant information,  also on data governance, and this will only be possible if they are informed b y the users of the AI  systems specifically of the systems being used and applied to them.   In their Joint Opinion on the proposed regulation  on AI, the EDPB and the EDPS have identified as a  major blind spot in the proposal the absence  of references to the individuals affected  by AI  systems, '[w]hether they are end -users, simply data subjects or other persons concerned by the AI  system ' (Joint Opinion 5/2021 8). The EDPB and the EDPS notably call for the proposal to explicitly  address the rights and remedies  available to individuals  subject to AI systems (ibid. 9). They have  also brought to the fore that, from the perspective of EU data protection law, the ' problem regarding  the way to properly inform individuals about ' the processing of data for remote biometric  identification 'is still unsolved ', as is still unsolved 'the effective and timely exercise of the rights of  individuals ' (ibid.  11). Rights and remedies are especially important when AI systems involve  biometri c data, and even more where remote processing affects the level of individuals ' awareness.  
STOA  | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology      58 The UK 's ICO investigations into the use of live facial recognition in public places revealed numerous  problems in terms of signage displayed, communications to the public, and information available  in privacy notices (ICO 2021 20). Transparency is thus a key challenge in this area, and it is of the  greatest importance because a lack of transparency directly affect s the  individuals ' ability to  exercise their data prot ection rights  (idem).   The Impact Assessment accompanying the proposal for a regulation  on AI conceded that,  whenever  AI is at stake, ' [i]f breaches of fundamental rights do happen, these can also be very difficult to detect  and prove, especially when the s ystem is not transparent'  (SWD(2021) 84 final Part 1/2 16).  Whereas the proposed Article 52 AIA establishes that ' [u]sers of an emotion recognition system or a  biometric categorisation system shall inform of the operation of the system the natural persons  exposed thereto ', it also declares that such ' obligation shall not apply to AI systems used for  biometric categorisation, which are permitted by law to detect, prevent and investigate criminal  offences '. This limitation of transparency, applying specifically to systems that might be attributing  individuals to categories constituting special categories of data, shall only be envisage d if  compensated by other means that would render the use of such systems transparent enough to  be accountable.   Policy option 9: No special exemptions for EU large -scale  databases   The use of biometrics and AI in EU large- scale IT systems raises special risks for fundamental rights.  The fact that the proposal for a regulation  of AI of the European Commission delibera tely pushes  away from its scope of application certain upcoming AI systems to be used in the context of the  Schengen Information System (SIS), the Visa Information System (VIS), Eurodac, the Entry/Exit  System, the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), the European Criminal  Records Information System on third -country nationals and stateless persons (ECRIS -TCN), and their  Interoperability, is of great concern .  Although it is true that the mentioned large- scale IT systems are not completely excluded from the  scope of the regulation , the proposed Article 83(1) AIA would leave out of its scope in an indefinite  manner any AI system they would use,  if the AI system was put on the market at any moment during  the first year of application of the proposed regulation . This can have as in direct effect to incentivise  a major advent in the market of potentially high -risk systems that will nonetheless manage to  evade the need to comply with the regulation , later to be used in systems that process mas sive  quantities of sensitive data of individuals often in a vulnerable position . This must thus be  avoided.   The EDPB and the EDPS have noted that, generally speaking, taking into account that  the entry into  application of the regulation  is envisaged for t wo years after its entry into force, it does not appear  'appropriate to exempt AI systems already placed on the market for an even longer period of time '  (Joint Opinion 5/2021 13).  The mentioned information systems, most of which are already established and some of which are  about to be launched in the AFSJ, almost entirely concern only non- EU citizens. Over the years, some  have stressed that this fact could explain that in their context ' the use of dubious, untested  technologies is taking place with so little public interest and scrutiny ' (Jones 2020 35). The routine  registration of the biometric data of third country nationals  in these EU information systems has  progressively configured what has been described as ' a system of mass surveillance ' (Vavoula 2020).   In a 2020 Resolution, the European Parliament noted that there needs to be an ' extensive and  rigorous public scrutiny and the highest possible level of transparency  both with regard to the  risk assessment of individual applications, as well as a general overview of the use of AI, robotics and 
Person identification, human rights and ethical principles      59 related technologies in the area of law enforcement and border control ' (EP P9_TA(2020)0275 para.  71). It is thus essential that large -scale IT systems in the AFSJ comply with the highest standards of  EU law.

     As the use of biometrics becomes commonplace in the  era of artificial intelligence (AI), this study aims to  identify the impact on fundamental rights of current  and upcoming developments, and to put forward  relevant policy options at European Union (EU) level.   Taking as a starting point the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying  down harmonised rules on AI, presented by the  European Commission in April 2021, the study reviews  key controversies surrounding what the proposal  addresses through the notions of 'remote biometric  identification' (which most nota bly includes live facial  recognition), 'biometric categorisation' and so -called  'emotion recognition'.   Identifying gaps in the proposed approaches to all  these issues, the study puts them in the context of  broader regulatory discussions. More generally, th e  study stresses that the scope of the current legal approach to biometric data in EU law, centred on the  use of such data for identification purposes, leaves out  numerous curr ent and expected developments that are  not centred on the identification of indi viduals, but  nevertheless have a serious impact on their  fundamental rights and democracy.
