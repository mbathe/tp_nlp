“ARCC”: An Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence
TRI-EN|2020-04-09





Background
Pony Ma, Chairman and CEO of Tencent, proposed that the future development of AI needs to be available, reliable, comprehensible, and controllable
 
Further Explanation 
Jason Si, Dean of Tencent Research Institute, translated and elaborated the four principles as “ARCC” (same pronunciation as ark)
In his opinion, just as the Noah’s Ark preserved the fire of human civilization, the healthy development of AI needs to be guaranteed by the “ethical ark”
 
Principle Ⅰ: AI should be available
Human development and well-being 
Ensure AI is available to as many people as possible, to achieve inclusive and broadly-shared development, and avoid technology gap
 
Human-oriented approach 
Respect human dignity, rights and freedoms, and cultural diversity
 
Human-computer symbiosis
Relation between AI and human is not an either-or relationship, on the contrary, AI can and should enhance human wisdom and creativity
 
Algorithmic fairness
Ethics by design (EBD): ensure that algorithm is reasonable, and data is accurate, up-to-date, complete, relevant, unbiased and representative, and take technical measures to identify, solve and eliminate bias
Formulate guidelines and principles on solving bias and discrimination, potential mechanisms include algorithmic transparency, quality review, impact assessment, algorithmic audit, supervision and review, ethical board, etc.
 
PrincipleⅡ: AI should be reliable 
General requirements 
AI should be safe and reliable, and capable of safeguarding against cyberattacks and other unintended consequences
 
Test and validation 
Ensure AI systems go through vigorous test and validation, to achieve reasonable expectations of performance
 
Digital security, physical security, and political security 
 
Privacy protection 
Comply with privacy requirements, and safeguard against data abuse Privacy by design (PBD)
 
PrincipleⅢ: AI should be comprehensible
“Black-box” technology 
Promote algorithmic transparency and algorithmic audit, to achieve understandable and explainable AI systems
 
Differential transparency 
Different entity needs different transparency and information, and intellectual property, technical feature, and technical literacy should also be considered
 
Explanation rather than technological transparency 
Provide explanation in respect of decisions assisted/made by AI systems where appropriate
 
Public engagement and exercise of individuals’ rights 
Various ways of engagement: user feedback, user choice, user control, etc.; use the capabilities of AI systems to foster an equal empowerment and enhance public engagement
Respect individuals’ rights, such as data privacy, expression and information freedom, non-discrimination, etc.; challenge decisions assisted/made by AI systems; provide relief for victims in respect of AI-caused harms
 
Informational self-determination 
Ensure individuals’ right to know, and provide users with sufficient information concerning AI system’s purpose, function, limitation, and impact
 
PrincipleⅣ: AI should be controllable Effective control by humans 
Effective control by humans 
Avoid endanger the interests of individuals or the overall interests of the human species
 
Risk Control 
Ensure the benefits substantially outweigh the controllable risks, and take appropriate measures to safeguard against the risks
 
Precautionary principle
Ensure AGI/ASI that may appear in the future serves the interests of humanity
 
Application boundary 
Define the boundary of AI application
 
To build trust in AI, we need a spectrum of rules, ethics is just the beginning
Light-touch rules e.g. social conventions, moral rules, self-regulation, etc. 
Mandatory rules e.g. standards, regulations, etc. 
Criminal law
International law
