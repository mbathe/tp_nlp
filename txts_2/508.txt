DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12   3  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  Abstract   Recent years have seen impressive advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and this  has stoked renewed  concern about the impact of technological progress on the labour market, including on worker  displacement.   This paper  looks at the possible links between AI and employment in a cross -country context. It adapts the  AI occupational impac t measure  developed  by Felten, Raj and Seamans (2018 [1]; 2019 [2]) – an indicator  measuring the degree to which occupations rely on abilities  in which AI has made th e most progress – and  extends it to 23 OECD countries. The indicator, which  allows for variations in AI exposure across  occupations, as well as within occ upations and across countries, is then matched to Labour Force Surveys,  to analyse the relationship with employment.   Over the period 2012 -2019, employment grew in nearly all occupations  analysed. Overall, there appears  to be no clear relationship between AI exposure and employment growth. However, in occupations where  computer use is high, greater exposure to AI is linked to higher employment growth. The paper also finds  suggestive evidence of a negative relationship between AI exposure and growth in average hours worked  among occupations where computer use is low.    While further research is needed to identify the exact mechanisms driving these  results, one possible  explanation is that partial automation by AI increases productivity directly as well as by shifting the task  composition of occupations towards higher value -added tasks. This increase in labour productivity and  output counteracts the  direct displacement effect of automation through AI  for workers with good digital  skills, who  may find it easier to use AI effectively  and shift to non -automatable, higher -value  added  tasks  within their occupations.  The opposite could be true for workers with poor digital skills, who may  not be  able to interact efficiently with AI and thus reap all potential benefits of the technology.     
4  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12   ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  Résumé   Ces dernières années, l'intelligence artificielle (IA) a fait des progrès considérables , suscitant un regain   d’inquiétude  quant à l'impact du progrès technologique sur le marché du travail, et en particulier  sur les  suppressions d’emplois.   Cette étude  examine les liens possibles entre l'IA et l'emploi dans un contexte transnational. Il adapte la  mesure de l'impact de  l'IA sur les professions  développée par Felten, Raj et Seamans (2018 [1]; 2019 [2]) -  un indicateur mesurant le degré auquel les professions reposent sur des capacités dans lesquelles l'IA a  le plus progr essé - et l'étend à 23 pays de l'OCDE. L'indicateur, qui permet de tenir compte des variations  de l'exposition à l'IA entre les professions, ainsi qu'au sein des professions et entre les pays, est ensuite  mis en correspondance avec les enquêtes sur les for ces de travail, afin d'analyser la relation avec l'emploi.   Sur la période 2012 -2019, l'emploi a augmenté dans presque toutes les professions analysées.  Globalement, il ne semble pas y avoir de relation claire entre l'exposition à l'IA et la croissance de l'emploi.  Toutefois, dans les professions où l’informatisation  est élevée, une plus grande exposition à l'IA est liée à  une plus forte croissance de l'emploi. L'étude met également en avant des éléments qui suggèrent une  relation négative entre l'expositio n à l'IA et la croissance du nombre moyen d'heures travaillées dans les  professions où l’informatisation  est faible.   Bien que des recherches supplémentaires soient nécessaires afin d’identifier avec exactitude les  mécanismes qui sous -tendent  ces résultats , une explication possible est que l'automatisation partielle  induite par l'IA augmente la productivité directement ainsi qu'en déplaçant la composition des tâches au  sein des  professions vers des tâches à plus forte valeur ajoutée. Cette augmentation de l a productivité du  travail et de la production contrebalance l'effet de déplacement direct de l'automatisation par l'IA pour les  travailleurs ayant de bonnes compétences numériques, qui peuvent avoir plus de facilité à  utiliser  efficacement l'IA et à s’orie nter vers  des tâches non automatisables à plus forte valeur ajoutée. Cela  pourrait être l’inverse  pour les travailleurs ayant de faibles compétences numériques, qui pourraient ne  pas être en mesure d'interagir efficacement avec l'IA et donc de profiter de tous les bienfaits  potentiels de  la technologie.   
DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12   5  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  Abriss   Der Bereich der künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) hat sich in den letzten Jahren enorm weiterentwickelt, was  neue Bedenken hinsichtlich des technologischen Fortschritts auf dem Arbeitsmarkt einschließlich  dem  Verlust von Arbeitsplätzen entfachte.   Im vorliegenden Beitrag werden die möglichen Zusammenhänge zwischen KI und Beschäftigung  länderübergreifend beleuchtet. Die von Felten, Raj und Seamans (2018 [1]; 2019 [2]) entwickelte Grad des  Ausgesetztseins von Berufen gegenüber KI – ein Indikator, der misst, inwieweit Berufe von Fähigkeiten  abhängen, bei denen die KI schon weit fortgeschritten ist – wird dabei angepasst und auf 23 OECD -Länder  ausgeweitet. Der I ndikator, der je nach Beruf, aber auch innerhalb von Berufen und je nach Land  unterschiedliche KI -Potenziale annehmen kann, wird mit Arbeitskräfteerhebungen zusammengeführt, um  den Zusammenhang zwischen KI und Beschäftigung zu analysieren.   Im Zeitraum 201 2–2019 ist die Beschäftigung in nahezu allen untersuchten Berufen gestiegen. Insgesamt  scheint es keinen eindeutigen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Grad des KI -Ausgesetztseins und dem  Beschäftigungszuwachs je nach Beruf zu geben. Bei Berufen mit starkem Compute reinsatz ist ein  größeres KI -Ausgesetztsein allerdings mit einem stärkeren Beschäftigungszuwachs verbunden.  Gleichzeitig scheint es bei Berufen mit geringem Computereinsatz Hinweise auf eine negative Korrelation  zwischen KI -Ausgesetztsein und dem Wachstum durchschnittlich geleisteter Arbeitsstunden zu geben.   Die genauen Mechanismen, die diesen Ergebnissen zugrunde liegen, müssen zwar noch weiter erforscht  werden, eine mögliche Erklärung könnte aber sein, dass eine teilweise Automatisierung durch KI zu eine r  direkten Produktivitätssteigerung führt. Zusätzlich könnte KI dazu führen, dass die  Aufgabenzusammensetzung eines Berufs sich hin zu Aufgaben mit höherer Wertschöpfung verändert.  Diese Steigerung bei der Arbeitsproduktivität wirkt der direkten Substituti on von Arbeit durch KI bei  Beschäftigten mit guten digitalen Kompetenzen, die es möglicherweise leichter finden, die KI wirksam  einzusetzen und innerhalb ihres Berufs zu nicht automatisierbaren Aufgaben mit höherer Wertschöpfung  zu wechseln, entgegen. Bei Beschäftigten mit geringen digitalen Kompetenzen, die möglicherweise nicht  in der Lage sind, KI effizient einzusetzen und dadurch alle potenziellen Vorteile der Technologie zu nutzen,  könnte sich hingegen das Gegenteil erweisen.

8  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12   ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  Recent years have seen impressive advances in Artificial I ntelligence (AI), particularly in the areas of image  and speech recognition, natural language processing, translation, reading comprehension, computer  programming and predictive analytics.   This rapid progress has been accompanied by concern about the poss ible effects of AI deployment on the  labour market, including on worker displacement. There are  reasons to believe that its impact on  employment may be different from previous waves of technological progress . Autor , Levy and Murnane   (2003 [3]) postulated that jobs consist of routine (and thus in principle programmable) and non -routine tasks.  Previous waves of technological progress were primarily associated  with the automation of routine tasks .  Computers, for example, are capable of performing routine cognitive tasks including record -keeping,  calculation, and searching for information. Similarly, industrial robots are programmable manipulators of  physical objects and therefore associated with the automation of routine manua l tasks  such as welding,  painting or packaging (Raj and Seamans, 2019 [4]).1 These technologies therefore mainly substitute for  workers in low - and middle -skill occupations.   Tasks typically associated with high -skilled occupati ons, such as n on-routine manual tasks ( requiring  dexterity) and non -routine cognitive tasks ( requiring abstract reasoning, creativity, and social intelligence )  were  previously thought to be outside the scope of automation (Autor, Levy and Murnane, 2003 [3];  Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020 [5]).   However, r ecent advances in AI mean that non-routine cognitive tasks  can also increasingly be automated  (Lane and Saint -Martin, 2021 [6]). In most  of its current applications, AI refers to computer software that  relies on highly sophisticated algorithmic techniques to find patterns in data and make predictions about  the future.  Analysis of patent texts suggests AI is capable of formulating medical p rognosis and suggesting  treatment, detecting cancer and identifying  fraud  (Webb, 2020 [7]). Thus, in contrast to previous waves of  automation, AI might disproportionally affect high -skilled workers.   Even if AI automates non -routine, cognitive tasks, t his does not necessarily mean that AI will displace   workers. I n general, technological progress improves labour efficiency by (partially) taking over /speeding  up tasks performed by workers . This  leads to an increase in output per ef fective labour input and a  reduction in production costs. The employment effects of this process are ex -ante ambiguous: employment  may fall as tasks are automated (substitution effect ). On the other hand, l ower production costs may  increase output if there  is sufficient demand  for the good/service (productivity effect) .2                                                   1 AI may however be used in robotics (“smart robots”), which blurs t he line between the two technologies (Raj and  Seamans, 2019 [4])). For example, AI has improved the vision of robots, enabling them to identify and sort unorganised  objects such as harvested fruit. AI can also be used to transfe r knowledge between robots, such as the layout of  hospital rooms between cleaning robots (Nolan, 2021 [22]).   2 This can only be the case if an occupation is only partially automated, but depending on the price elasticity of dem and  for a given product or service, the productivity effect can be strong. For example, during the 19th century, 98% of the  tasks required to weave fabric were automated, decreasing the price of fabric. Because of highly price elastic demand  for fabric, th e demand for fabric increased as did the number of weavers (Bessen, 2016 [20]).  1.  Introduction  
DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12   9  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  To harness this productivity effect, workers need to both learn to work effectively with the new technology  and to adapt to a changing task composition that puts more emphasis on tasks that  AI cannot yet perform.  Such adaptation is costly and the cost will depend on worker characteristics.   The areas where AI is currently making the most progress are associated with non -routine, cognitive tasks  often performed by medium - to high -skilled, whi te collar workers. However, these workers also rely more  than other workers on abilities AI does not currently possess, such as i nductive reasoning or social  intelligence. Moreover, h ighly educated workers often find it easier to adapt to new technologies because  they are more likely to already work with  digital  technolog ies and participate more in  training, which puts  them in a better position than lower -skilled workers to reap the potential benefits  of AI.  That being said ,  more educated workers also tend to have more task -specific human capital,3 which might make adaption  more costly for them  (Fossen and Sorgner, 2019 [8]).   As AI is a relatively new technology, there is little empirical evidence on its effect on the labour mark et to  date. The  literature that does exist is mostly limited to the US and finds little evidence for AI -driven worker  displacement (Lane and Saint -Martin, 2021 [6]). Felten, Raj and Seamans  (2019 [2]) look at the effect of  exposure to AI4 on employment and wages in the US at the occupational level. They do not find any link  between AI exposure and (aggregate) employment, but they do find a positive effect of AI exposure on  wage growth, suggesting that the productivity effect of AI may outweigh the substitution effect. This effect  on wage growth is concentrated in occupations that require software skills and in high -wage occupations.   Again for the US, Fossen and Sorgner  (2019 [8]) look at the effect of exposure to AI5 on job stability and  wage growth at the individual level. They find that exposure to AI leads to higher employment stability and  higher wages, and that this effect is stronger for higher edu cated and more experienced workers, again  indicating that the productivity effect dominates and that it is stronger for high -skilled workers.   Finally, Acemoglu , Autor and Hazell  (2020 [9]) look at hiring in US firms with task structures compatible with  AI capabilities.6 They find that firms’ exposure to AI is linked to changes in the structure of skills that firms  demand. They find no evidence of employment effects at the occupational level, but  they do find that firms  that are exposed to AI restrict their hiring in non -AI positions compared to other firms. They conclude that  the employment effect of AI might still be too small to be detected in aggregate data (given also how recent  a phenomenon AI is), but that it might emerge in the future as AI adoption spreads.                                                    3 Education directly increases task -specific human capital as well as the rate of learning -by-doing on the job, at least  some of which is task -specific (Gibbons and Waldman, 2004 [40]; Gibbons and Waldman, 2006 [38]). This can be seen  by looking at the likelihood of lateral moves within the same firm: lateral moves have a direct productivity cost to the  firm a s workers cannot utilise their entire task -specific human capital stock in another area (e.g. when moving from  marketing to logistics). However, accumulating at least some task -specific human capital in a lateral position makes  sense if a worker is schedul ed to be promoted to a position that oversees both areas. If a worker’s task -specific human  capital is sufficiently high, however, the immediate productivity loss associated with a lateral move is higher than any  expected productivity gain from the lateral  move following a promotion. For example, in academic settings, PhD  economists are not typically moved to the HR department prior to becoming the dean of a department. Using a large  employer -employee linked dataset on executives at US corporations, Jin and  Waldman (2019 [41]) show that workers  with 17 years of education were twice as likely to be laterally moved before promotion than workers with 19 years of  education.   4 An occupation is “exposed” to AI if it has a high in tensity in skills that AI can perform, see section 2.3 for details.    5 Fossen and Sorgner  (2019 [8]) use the occupational impact measure developed by Felten, Raj and Seamans  (2018 [1];  2019 [2]) and the Suitability for Machine Learning indicator developed by Brynjolfsson  et al.  (Brynjolfsson and Mitchell,  2017 [16]; Brynjolfsson, Mitchell and Rock, 2018 [17]) discussed in section  2.3.  6 Acemoglu , Autor and Hazell  (2020 [9]) use data from Felten, Raj and Seamans  (2018 [1]; 2019 [2]), Brynjolfsson, Mitchell  and Rock  (2017 [16]; 2018 [17]) and (Webb, 2020 [7]) to identify  tasks compatible with AI capabilities; and data from online  job postings to i dentify firms that use AI, see Section 2.  for details.  
10  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  This paper  adds to the literature by looking at the links between AI and employment growth in a cross country context. It adapts the AI occupational impact measure  proposed by Felten, Raj and Seamans  (2018 [1]; 2019 [2]) – an indicator measuring the degree to which occupations rely on abilities  in which AI has  made th e most progress in recent years – and extends it to 23 OECD countries by linking it to the Survey  of Adult Skills, PIAAC. This indicator, which  allows for variations in AI exposure across occupations, as  well as within occ upations and across countries, is matched to Labour Force Surveys to analyse the  relationship with emplo yment growth.   The paper finds that, o ver the period 2012 -2019, there is no clear relationship between AI exposure and  employment growth across all occupations. Moreover, in occupations where computer use is high, AI  appears to be positively associated with  employment gr owth . There is also  some evidence of a negative  relationship between AI exposure and growth in average hours worked among occupations where  computer use is low.  While further research is needed to identify the exact mechanisms driving these  results, one possible explanation is that  partial automation by  AI increases productivity directly as well as  by shifting the task composition of occupations towards higher value -added tasks. This increase in labour  productivity and output counteracts the d irect displacement effect of automation through AI  for workers  with good digital skills, who  may find it easier to use AI effectively  and shift to non -automatable, higher value tasks within their occupations.  The opposite could be true for workers with poo r digital skills, who  may be unable to interact efficiently with AI and thus reap all potential benefits of the technology.    The paper starts out by presenting indicators of AI deployment that have been proposed in the literature  and discussing their rela tive merits (Section  2. ). It then goes on to present the indicator developed in this  paper and builds some intuition on the channels through which occupations are potentially affected by AI  (Section 3. ). Section 4.  presents the main results.    
DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12   11  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  To analyse  the links between AI and employment, it is necessary to determine where in the economy AI is  currently deployed. In the absence  of comprehensive data on the adoption of AI by firms, several proxies  for (potential) AI deployment have been proposed in the literature. They can be grouped into two broad  categories. The first group of indicators uses information on labour demand to inf er AI activity across  occupations, sectors and locations. In practice, these indicators use online job postings that provide  information on skills requirements and they therefore will only capture AI deployment if it requires workers  to have AI skills. The  second group of  indicators uses information on AI capabilities – that is, information  on what AI can currently do – and link s it to occupations. The se indicators  measure potential exposure to  AI and not actual AI adoption. This section presents some of th ese indicators and discusses their  advantages and drawbacks.   2.1. Indicators based on AI -related job posting frequencies   The first set of indicators use data on AI -related skill requirements in job postings as a proxy for AI  deployment in firms. The main data  source for these indicators is Burning Glass Technologies (BGT),  which collects detailed information – including job title, sector, required skills etc. – on online job postings   (see Box 1 for details ). Because of the rich and up -to-date information BGT data offers, these indicators  allow for a timely tracking of the demand for AI skills across the labour market.   Squicciarini and Nachtigall (2021 [10]) identify AI -related  job postings by using keywords extracted from  scientific publications, augmented by text mining techniques and expert validation (see Baruffaldi et  al.  (2020 [11]) for details). These keywords belong to four broad groups : (i) generic AI keywords, e.g. “artificial  intelligence”, “machine learning”; (ii) AI approaches or methods: e.g. “decision trees”, “deep learning”; (iii)  AI applications: e.g. “computer vision”, “image recognition”; (iv) AI software and libraries: e.g. P ython or  TensorFlow. Since some of these keywords may be used in job postings for non AI -related jobs (e.g.  “Python”, or “Bayesian”), the authors only tag a job as AI -related if the posting contains at least two AI  keywords from at least two distinct conce pts. This indicator is available on an annual basis for Canada,  Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States, for 2012 – 2018.7   Acemoglu et  al. (2020 [9]) take a simpler approach by defi ning vacancies as AI -related if they contain any  keyword belonging to a simple list of skills related to AI .8 As this indicator will tag any job posting that                                                   7 Sectors are available according to the North American Industry classification system (NAICS) for the US and Canada  and according to the UK Standard Industrial Classifica tion (SIC) and Singapore Industrial Classification (SSIC) for the  UK and Singapore. Occupational codes are available according to the O*NET classification for Canada, SOC for the  UK and the US and SSOC for Singapore. These codes can be converted to ISCO at  the one -digit level.   8 This paper uses the same list of skills to look at AI job -postings, see footnote 42 for the complete list of skills.  2.  Indicators of occupational  exposure to AI  
12  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  contains one of the keywords, it is less precise than the indicator proposed by Squicciarini and N achtigall  (2021 [10]), but also easier to reproduce.   Dawson, Rizoiu and Williams  (2021 [12]) develop the skills -space  or skills -similarity  indicator. This approach  defines two sk ills as similar if they often occur together in BGT job postings and are both simultaneously  important for the job posting. A skill is assumed to be less “important” for a particular job posting if it is  common across job postings. For example, “communicat ion” and “team work” occur in about a quarter of  all job adds, and would therefore be less important than “machine learning” in a job posting requiring both  ”communication” and “team work” .9 The idea behind this approach is that, if two skills are often  simultaneously required for jobs, (i) they are complementary and (ii) mastery of one skill means it is easier  to acquire the other. In that way, similar skills may act as “bridges” for workers wanting to change  occupations. It also means that workers who pos sess skills that are similar to AI skills may find it easier to  work with AI, even if they are not capable of developing the technology themselves. For example, the skill  “copy writing” is similar to “journalism”, meaning that a copy writer might transitio n to journalism at a lower  cost than, say, a social worker, and that a copy writer might find it comparatively easier to use databases  and other digital tools created for journalists.    Skill similarity allows the identification and tracking of emerging sk ills: using a short list of “seed skills”,10  the indicator can track similar skills as they appear in job ads over time, keeping the indicator up to date.  For example, TensorFlow is a deep learning framework introduced in 2016. Many job postings now list it   as a requirement without additionally specifying “deep learning”  (Dawson, Rizoiu and Williams, 2021 [12]).   The skill similarity approach is preferable to the simple job posting frequency indicators mentioned above  (Squicciarini and Nachtigall, 2021 [10]; Acemoglu et  al., 2020 [9]) as it does not only pick up specific AI job  postings, but also job postings with skills that are similar (but not identical) to AI skills, and may thus enable  workers to work with AI technologies. Another advantage of this indicator is its dynamic nature: as  technologies develop and skill requirements evolve, skill similarity can identify new skills that appear in job  postings togethe r with familiar skills, and keep the relative skill indicators up -to-date. This indicator is  available at the annual level from 2012 -2019 for Australia and New Zealand.11  Box 1. Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) online job postings data   Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) collects data on online job postings by web -scraping 40 000 online  job boards and company websites. It claims to cover the near -universe of online job postings. Data are  currently available for Australia, Canada, New Zeala nd, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United  States for the time period 2012 -2020 (2014 -2020 for Germany and 2018 -2020 for other European Union  countries). BGT extracts information such as location, sector, occupation, required skills, education and  experience levels from the text of job postings (deleting duplicates) and organises it into up to 70  variables that can be linked to labour force surveys, providing detailed and timely information on labour  demand.                                                    9 To measure importance of skills in job ads, the authors use the Revealed Comparativ e Advantage (RCA) measure,  loaned from trade economics, that weighs the importance of a skill in a job posting up if the number of skills for this  specific posting is low, and weighs it down if the skill is ubiquitous in all job adds. That is, the skill “t eam work” will be  generally less important given its ubiquity in all job ads, but its importance in an individual job posting would increase  if only few other skills were required for that job.   10 “Artificial Intelligence”, “Machine Learning”, “Data Science ”, “Data Mining” and “Big Data”.   11 The indicator is calculated at the division level (19 industries) according to the Australian and New Zealand Standard  Industrial Classification Level (ANZSIC).  
DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12   13  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  Despite its strengths, BGT data has a numb er of limitations:    It misses vacancies that are not posted online. Carnevale, Jayasundera and Repnikov (2014 [13])  compare vacancies from survey data according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover  Survey (JOLTS) from t he US Bureau of Labour Statistics, a representative survey of 16 000 US  businesses, with BGT data for 2013. They find that roughly 70% of vacancies were posted  online, with vacancies requiring a college degree significantly more likely to be posted online  compared to jobs with lower education requirements.    There is not necessarily a direct, one -to-one correspondence between an online job ad and an  actual vacancy: firms might post one job ad for several vacancies, or post job ads without firm  plans to hire,  e.g. because they want to learn about available talent for future hiring needs.    BGT data might over -represent growing firms that cannot draw on internal labour markets to the  same extent as the average firm.    Higher turnover in some occupations and indus tries can produce a skewed image of actual  labour demand since vacancies reflect a mixture of replacement demand as well as expansion.   In addition, since BGT data draws on published job advertisements, it is a proxy of current vacancies,  and not of hiring  or actual employment. As a proxy for vacancies, BGT data performs reasonably well,  although some occupations and sectors are over -represented. Hershbein and Kahn (2018 [14]) show for  the US that, compared to vacancy data  from the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics’ Job Openings and  Labour Turnover Survey (JOLTS), BGT over -represents health care and social assistance, finance and  insurance, and education, while under -representing accommodation, food services and construction   (where informal hiring is more prevalent) as well as public administration/government. These  differences are stable across time, however, such that changes  in labour demand in BGT track well  with JOLTS data. Regarding hiring, they also compare BGT data wi th new jobs according to the Current  Population Survey (CPS). BGT data strongly over -represents computer and mathematical occupations  (by a factor of over four, which is a concern when looking at growth in demand for AI skills as compared  to other skills),  as well as occupations in management, healthcare, and business and financial  operations. It under -represents all remaining occupations, including transportation, food preparation  and serving, production or construction.   Cammeraat and Squicciarini (2020 [15]) argue that, because of differences in turnover across  occupations, countries and time, as well as differences in the collection of national vacancy statistics,  the representativeness of BGT data as an indicator for l abour and skills demand should be measured  against employment growth. They compare growth rates in employment with growth rates in BGT job  postings on the occupational level in the six countries for which a BGT timeline exists. They find that,  across count ries, the deviation between BGT and employment growth rates by occupation is lower than  10 percentage points for 65% of the employed population. They observe the biggest deviations for  agricultural, forestry and fishery workers, as well as community and pe rsonal service workers, again  occupations where informal hiring may be more prevalent.   2.2. Task -based indicators   Task -based indicators for AI adoption are based on measures of AI capabilities linked to tasks workers  perform, often at the occupational level. They identify occupations as exposed to AI if they perform tasks  that AI is increasingly capable of performing.  
14  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  The AI occupational exposure  measure  developed by Felten, Raj and Seamans  (2018 [1]; 2019 [2]) is based  on progress scores in nine AI applications12 (such as reading comprehension or image recognition) from  the AI progress measurement dataset provided by the Electro nic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The EFF  monitors progress in AI applications using a  mixture of academic literature, blog posts and websites  focused on AI. Each application may have several progress scores. One example of a progress score  would be a recognition error rate for image recognition. The authors rescale these scores to arrive a t a  composite score that measures progress in each application between 2010 and 2015.   Felten, Raj and Seamans  (2018 [1]; 2019 [2]) then link these AI applications to abilities in the US Department  of Labo r’s O*NET database . Abilities are defined as “enduring attributes of the individual that influence  performance”, e.g. “peripheral vision” or “oral comprehension”. They enable workers to perform tasks in  their jobs (such as driving a car or answering a call ), but are distinct from skills in that they cannot typically  be acquired or learned. Thus, linking O*NET abilities to AI applications means linking human to AI abilities.   The link between O*NET abilities and AI applications (a correlation matrix) is made  via an Amazon  Mechanical Turk survey of 200 gig workers per AI application, who are asked whether a given AI  application – e.g. image recognition – can be used for a certain ability – e.g. peripheral vision.13 The  correlation matrix between applications an d abilities is then calculated as the share of respondents who  thought that a given AI application could be used for a given ability. These abilities are subsequently linked  to occupations using the O*NET database. This indicator is available for the US fo r 2010 -15.14   Similarly, the Suitability for Machine Learning  indicator developed by Brynjolfsson, Mitchell and Rock   (2017 [16]; 2018 [17]) assigns a suitability for machine learning score to each of the 2  069 narrowly defined  work activities from the O*NET database that are shared across occupations (e.g. “assisting and caring  for others”, “coaching others”, “coordinating the work of others”). For these scores, they use a Machine  Learning suitability rubric  consisting of 23 distinct statements describing a work activity. For example, for  the statement “Task is describable by rules”, the highest score would be “Task can be fully described by a  detailed set of rules (e.g. following a recipe)”, whereas the lowe st score would be “The task has no clear,  well-known set of rules on what is and is not effective (e.g. writing a book)”. They use the human  intelligence task crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower to score each direct work activity by seven to ten  respondents . The direct work activities are then aggregated to tasks (e.g. “assisting and caring for others”,  “coaching others”, “coordinating the work of others”  aggregate to “interacting with others”), and the tasks  to occupations. This indicator is available for t he US for the year 2016/2017.   Tolan et  al. (2021 [18]) introduce a layer of cognitive abilities to connect AI applications (that they call  benchmarks) to tasks. The authors define 14 cognitive a bilities (e.g. visual processing, planning and  sequential decision -making and acting, communication, etc.) from the psychometrics, comparative  psychology, cognitive science and AI literature.15 They link these abilities to 328 different AI benchmarks                                                   12 Abstract strategy games, real -time video games, image rec ognition, visual question answering, image generation,  reading comprehension, language modelling, translation and speech recognition . Abstract strategy games, for  example are defined as “the ability to play abstract games involving sometimes complex strate gy and reasoning ability,  such as chess, go, or checkers, at a high level”. While the EFF tracks progress on 16 applications, AI has not made  any progress on 7 of these over the relevant time period. (Felten, Raj and Seaman s, 2021 [35]).   13 The background of the gig workers is not known and so they may not necessarily be AI experts. This could be a  potential weakness of this indicator. In contrast, Tolan et  al. 2021 [20]) rely on expert assessments for the link between  AI ap plications and worker abilities.  (2021 [18])  14 At the s ix digit SOC  2010 occupational level , this can be aggregated across sectors and geographical regions, see  (Felten, Raj and Seamans, 2021 [35]).   15 The abilities are chosen from Hernández -Orallo  (2017 [37]) to be at an intermediate level of detail, excluding very  general abilities that would influence all others, such as general i ntelligence, and too specific  abilities] and skills, such  as being able to drive a car or music skills. They also exclude any personality traits that do not apply to machines. The

They use the  research intensity in a specific benchmark (number of publications, news stories, blog entries etc.)   obtained from AI topics.17 Tasks are measured at the worker level using the European Working Conditions  Survey (EWCS), PI AAC and the O*NET database . Task intensity is derived as a measure of how much  time an individual worker spends on a task and how often the task is performed.   The mapping between cognitive abilities and AI benchmarks, as well as between c ognitive abilities and  tasks, relies on a correspondence matrix that assigns a value of 1 if the ability is absolutely required to  solve a benchmark or complete a task, and 0 if it is not necessary at all. This correspondence matrix was  populated by a grou p of multidisciplinary researchers for the mapping between tasks and cognitive abilities,  and by a group of AI -specialised researchers for the mapping between AI benchmarks and cognitive  abilities. This indicator is available from 2008 to 2018, at the ISCO -3 level, and constructed to be country invariant (as it combines data covering different countries).   Webb (2020 [7]) constructs his exposure of occupations to any technology  indicator by directly comparing  the text of p atents from Google patents public data to the texts of job descriptions from the O*NET database  to quantify the overlap between patent descriptions and job task descriptions. By limiting the patents to AI  patents (using a list of key -words), this indicator  can be narrowed to only apply to AI. Each particular task  is then assigned a score according to the prevalence of such patents that mention this task; tasks are then  aggregated to occupations.   2.3. What do these indicators measure?   To gauge the link between  AI and employment, the chosen indicator for this study should proxy actual AI  deployment in the economy as closely as possible. Furthermore, it should proxy AI deployment at the  occupation level because switching occupations is more costly for workers than  switching firms or sectors ,  making the occupation the relevant level for the automation risk of individual workers.   Task -based approaches measure potential automatability  of tasks (and occupations), so they are  measures of AI exposure, not deployment. Be cause task -based measures look at potential automatability,  they cannot capture uneven adoption of AI across occupations, sectors or countries. Thus, in a cross country analysis, the only source of variation in a task -based indicator are differences in the  occupational  task composition across countries, as well as cross -country differences in the occupational distribution.   Indicators based on job posting data measure demand  for AI skills (albeit with some noise, see Box 1), as  oppo sed to AI use. Thus, they rely on the assumption that AI use in a firm, sector or occupation will lead  to employer demand for AI skills in that particular firm, sector, or occupation . This is not necessarily the  case, however:    Some firms will decide to tr ain workers in AI rather than recruit workers with AI skills; their  propensity to do so may vary across occupations.                                                    abilities are: Memory processing, Sensorimotor interaction, Visual processin g, Auditory processing, Attention and  search, Planning, sequential decision -making and acting, Comprehension and expression, Communication, Emotion  and self -control, Navigation, Conceptualisation, learning and abstraction, Quantitative and logical reasonin g, Mind  modelling and social interaction and Metacognition and confidence assessment.   16 Free and open repository of machine learning code and results, which includes data from several repositories  (including EFF, NLPD progress etc.).   17 An archive kept by  the by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAI) .  
16  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified   Many AI applications will not require AI skills to work with them.    Even where AI skills are needed, many firms, especially smaller ones, a re likely to outsource AI  development and support with its adoption to specialised AI development firms. In this case,  vacancies associated with AI adoption would emerge in a different firm or sector to where the  technology was actually being deployed.    The assumption that AI deployment requires hiring of staff with AI skills is even more problematic  when the indicator is applied at the occupation level. Firms that adopt AI may seek workers with AI  skills in completely different occupations than the workers  whose tasks are being automated by AI.  For instance, an insurance company wanting to substitute or enhance  some of the tasks of  insurance clerks  with AI  would not  necessarily  hire insurance clerks with AI skills, but AI  professionals to develop or deploy the technology. Insurance clerks may only have to interact with  this technology, which might not require AI development skills (but may well require other  specialised skills). Thus, even with broad -based deployment of AI in the financial industry, this  indicator may not show an increasing number of job postings for insurance clerks  with AI skills .  This effect could also be heterogeneous across countries and time. For example, Saunders,  Ahrens and Qian (2020 [19]) show that  law firms  in the UK tend to hire AI professionals without legal  knowledge, while law firms in Singapore and the US do advertise jobs with hybrid legal -AI skillsets.   Thus, indicators based on labour demand data are a good proxy for AI deployment at the fi rm and sector  level as long as  there is no significant outsourcing of AI development and maintenance, and the production  process is such that using the technology requires specialised AI skills. If these assumptions do not hold,  these indicators will be in complete. Whether or not this is the case is an empirical question that requires  further research. To date the only empirical reference on this question is Acemoglu et  al. (2020 [9]) who  show for th e US that the share of job postings that require AI skills  increases faster in firms that are heavily  exposed to AI  (according to task -based indicators) . For example, a one standard deviation increase in the  measure of AI exposure according to Felten et al . (2018 [1]) (2019 [2])  leads to a 15% increase in the number  of published AI vacancies.   To shed further light on the relationship between the two types of indicators, Figure  1 plots the 2012 -2019  percentage point change in the share of BGT job postings that require AI skills18 across 36 sectors against  a sector -level task -based AI exposure score, similar to the occupational AI exposure score developed in  this paper (see Section 3.1.1 )19. This analysis only covers the United Kingdom and the United States20  because of data availability. For both countries, a positive relationship is apparent, suggesting that, overall,  (i) the two measures are consi stent and (ii) AI deployment does require some AI talent at the sector level .  Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in AI exposure (approximately the difference in exposure  between finance and public administration) is associated with a 0.33 high er percentage point change in  the share of job postings that require AI skills in the United -Kingdom; a similar relationship emerges in the  United -States.21                                                    18 AI-related technical skills are identified based on the list provided in Acemoglu et  al. (2020 [9]), and detailed in  footnote 42.   19 As with occupations, the industry -level scores are derived using the average frequency with which workers in each  industry perform a set of 33 tasks, separately for each country.   20 The United Kingdom and the Un ited States are the only countries in the sample analysed (see Section 3.1.1 ) with  2012 Burning Glass Technologies data available, thereby allowing for the examination of trends over the past decade.   21 The standard deviation of exposure to AI is 0.083 in the United -Kingdom and 0.075 in the United -States.  These  values are multiplied by the slopes of the linear relationships displayed in Figure  1: 3.90 and 4.95 respectively. The  average share of job posting s that require AI skills was 0.14% in the United -Kingdom and 0.26% in the United -States  in 2012, and this has increased to 0.67% and 0.94% respectively in 2019.

Source: Author’ calculations using data from Burning Glass Technologies , PIAAC and Felten, Raj and Seamans (2019 [2]).  While it  is reassuring  that, at the sector level, the two measures appear consistent, it is also clear that job  postings that require AI skills fail to identify certain sectors  that are, from a task perspective, highly exposed  to AI, such as education, the energy sector, the oil industry, public administration and real estate activities .  This sugges ts that  AI development and support may be outsourced and / or that the use of AI does not  require AI skills in these sectors.   In addition , and a s stated above, there is  a priori no reason that demand -based indicators would pick up  AI deployment at the  occupation al level, as firms that adopt AI may seek workers with AI skills in completely  different occupations than the workers whose tasks are being automated by AI .

Which employment effects can these indicators capture?   This paper analyses  the relationship between AI adoption and employment at the occupat ional level, since  it is automation risk at the occupational level that is most relevant for individual workers. The analysis will  therefore require a measure of AI adoption at the occupational level and this section assesses which type  of indicator might be best suited to that purpose.   It is useful to think of AI -driven automation as having two possible, but opposed, employment effects. On  the one hand, AI may depress employment via automation/substitution. On the other, it may increase it by  raising work er productivity.   Focusing on the substitution effect first, task -based indicators will pick up such effects since they measure  what tasks could potentially be automated by AI. By contrast, labour -demand based indicators identify  occupational AI exposure o nly if AI skills are mentioned in online job postings for a particular occupation.  Thus, they will only pick up substitution effects (that is, a subsequent decline in employment for a particular  occupation)  if the production process is such that workers wh ose tasks are being automated need AI skills  to interact with the technology.   Regarding the  productivity effect, there are several ways in which AI might increase employment. The most  straightforward way is that AI increases productivity in a given task, and thus lowers production costs,  which can lead to increased employment if demand for a product or service is sufficiently price elastic. This   was the case, for example, for weavers in the industrial revolution (see footnote 3, Bessen  (2016 [20])).   In addition, technological progress may allow  workers to focus on higher value -added  tasks  within their  occupation that the technology cannot (yet) perform. For example, AI is increasingly deploye d in the  financial services industry to forecast stock performance. Grennan and Michaely  (2017 [21]) show that stock  analysts have shifted their attention away from stocks for which an abundance of data is available ( which  lends itself to analysis by AI) towards stocks for which data is scarce. To predict the performance of “low AI” stocks, analysts gather “soft” information directly from companies’ management, suppliers and clients,  thus concentrating on tasks requiri ng a capacity for complex human interaction, of which AI is not (yet)  capable.   Task -based indicators will pick up these productivity effects (as they identify exposed occupations directly  via their task structure), while labour -demand based indicators wil l only do so if workers whose tasks are  being automated need to interact with the technology, and interacting with the technology requires  specialised AI skills.   AI can also be used to augment other technologies, that subsequently automate certain tasks. For  example, in robotics, AI supports the efficient automation of physical tasks by improving the vision of  robots, or by enabling robots to “learn” from the experience of other robots, e.g. by facilitating the exchange  of information on the layout of room s between cleaning robots (Nolan, 2021 [22]). While these improvements  to robotics are connected to AI applications (in this example: image recognition and sensory perception of  room layouts), the tasks that are being automated (cleaning of rooms) mostly consist of the physical  manipulation of objects and thus pertain to the field of robotics. Thus, AI improves the effectiveness of  robots to perform tasks associated with cleaners, without performing physical cleaning tasks. As ta skbased indicators only identify tasks that AI itself can perform (and not tasks that it merely facilitates), they  would not capture this effect. In robotics, this would mostly affect physical tasks often performed by low  and medium -skilled workers. Indic ators based on online vacancies would also be unlikely to capture AI  augmenting other technologies at the occupation level – unless cleaners require AI skills to work with  cleaning robots.  
DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12   19  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  Finally, AI could  enable the launch of completely new products or services, that lead to job creation, e.g.  in marketing or sales of AI -based products and services (Acemoglu et  al., 2020 [9]). Both task - and labour demand -based indicators cannot generally measure thi s effect  (unless marketing / selling of AI products  requires AI -skills).   To conclude, both types of indicators are likely to understate actual AI deployment at the occupational level  (see Table  1). Labour -demand based indicators i n particular will miss a significant part of AI deployment if  workers whose tasks are being automated do not need to interact with AI or if the use of AI does not require  any AI skills.  Task -based indicators, on the other hand, are not capable of picking u p differences in actual  AI deployment across time and space (this is because they only measure exposure, not actual adoption).  Finally, neither indicator will capture AI augmenting other automating technologies, such as robotics, which  is likely to disprop ortionally affect low -skilled, blue collar occupations.   On the whole, for assessing the links between AI and employment at the occupational level, indicators  based on labour demand data are likely to be incomplete. Task -based indicators are therefore more  appropriate for the analysis carried out in this paper. Keeping their  limitations in mind, however, is crucial.   Table  1.

20  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  This paper extends the occupational exposure measure , proposed by Felten, Raj and Seamans (2018 [1];  2019 [2]) to 23 OECD countries22 to look at the links between AI and  labour market outcomes for 36  occupations23 in recent years (2012 -2019). The measure of occupational exposure to AI  proxies the degree  to which tasks in those occupations can be automated by AI. Thus, t he analysis compar es occupation s  with a high degree of automatability by AI to those with a low degree.   This section presents the data used for the analysis. It begins by describing the construction of the measure  of occupational exposure to AI developed and used in this p aper, and builds some intuition as to why some  occupations are exposed to a higher degree of potential automation by AI than others. It then shows some  descriptive statistics for AI exposure and labour market outcomes: employment, working hours and job  postings that require AI skills. Finally, it describes different measures of the task composition of  occupations, which will help shed light on the relationship between AI exposure and labour market  outcomes.      3.1. Occupational exposure to AI   Several indicators  for (potential) AI deployment have been proposed in the literature (see Section  2. ),  most of them geared to the US. Since this paper looks at the links between AI and employment across  several countries, country coverage is a key criterion for the choice of indicator. This excludes indicators  based on AI -related job -posting frequencies, as pre -2018 BGT data is only available for English -speaking  countries). 24 In addition to data availability issues, indicators based on labour d emand data are also likely  to be less complete than task -based indicators (see Section 2.3).Among the task -based measures, the  suitability for machine learning  indicator  (Brynjolfsson a nd Mitchell, 2017 [16]; Brynjolfsson, Mitchell and  Rock, 2018 [17]) was not publicly accessible at the time of publication. Webb’s (2020 [7]) indicator captures  the stock of patents until 2020, and is therefore too recent  to look at the links between AI and the labour  market during the observation period (2012 -2019), particularly given that major advancements in AI  occurred between 2015 and 2020, and the slow pace of diffusion of technology in the economy. The paper  theref ore uses the occupational exposure measure (Felten, Raj and Seamans, 2018 [1]; 2019 [2]), which has  the advantage of capturing AI developments until 2015, leaving some time for the technology to be                                                   22 The 23 countries are Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,  Germany, Greece,  Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, Spain,  Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States.   23 This paper aims to explore the links between employment and AI deployment i n the economy, rather than the direct  employment increase due to AI development . Two occupations are particularly likely to be involved in AI development:  IT technology professionals and IT technicians.

It is also based on actual scientific progress in AI, as opposed to research activity  as the indicator proposed by Tolan et  al. (2021 [18]).   While the preferred measure for this an alysis is the AI occupational exposure  measure  proposed by Felten,  Raj and Seamans  (2018 [1]; 2019 [2]), the paper also presents additional results using Acemoglu et al.’s  (2020 [9]) job-posting indicator (an indicator based on job postings), as well as robustness checks using  task-based indicators by Tolan et al. (2021 [18]) and Webb (2020 [7]).25 This section describes the  construction of the main indicator, and some descriptive statistics.    3.1.1.  Construction of the AI occupational exposure measure   The AI occupational exposure  measure  links progress in nine  AI applications to 52 abilities in the US  Department of Labor’s O*NET database  (see Section 2.3 for more details). This paper extends it to 23  OECD countries by mapping  the O*NET abilities to tasks from the OECD’s  Survey of Adu lt Skills (PIAAC) ,  and then back to occupations  (see Figure  2 for an illustration of the link) .26 This allows for task -content  variations in AI exposure across occupations, as well as within occupations and across countries that may   arise because of institutional or socio -economic differences across countries. Thus, the indicator proposed  in this paper differs from that of Felten, Raj and Seamans  (2019 [2]) only in that it relies on PIAAC data to  take i nto account occupational task -content heterogeneity across countries. That is, the indicator adopted  in this paper is defined at the occupation -country cell level rather than at the occupation level (as in Felten,  Raj and Seamans  (2019 [2])). It is scaled such that the minimum is zero and the maximum is one over the  full sample of occupation -country cells . It indicates relative exposure to AI , and no other meaningful  interpretation can be given to its actual values.   In this pa per, the link between O*NET abilities and PIAAC tasks is performed manually by asking whether  a given ability is indispensable for performing a given task, e.g. is oral comprehension absolutely necessary  to teach people ? A given O*NET ability can therefore  be linked to several PIAAC tasks, and conversely, a  given PIAAC task can be linked to several O*NET abilities. This link was made by the authors of the paper  and, in case of diverging answers, agreement was reached through an iterative discussion and cons ensus  method, similar to the Delphi method described in Tolan et  al (2021 [18]). Of the 52 O*NET abilities, 35 are  related to at least one task in PIAAC. Thus, the indicator loses 17 abilities co mpared to Felten et. al.’s  (2018 [1]; 2019 [2]) measure. All the measures that are lost in this way are physical, psychomotor or sensory,                                                   25 While the three task -based indicators  point to the same relationships between exposure to AI and employment, the  results are less clearcut for the relationship between exposure to AI and average working hours.   26 Instead of using the O*NET US -specific measures of an ability’s “prevalence ” and “importance ” in an occupation ,  country -specific measures  have been  developed  based on data from the Programme for the International Assessment  of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which reports the frequenc y with which a number of tasks are performed on the job  by each surveyed individual. This information was used to measure the average frequency with which workers in each  occupation (classified using two -digit ISCO -08) perform 33 tasks, and this was done separately for each country. E ach  O*NET ability was then linked to each of these 33 tasks, based on the authors’ binary assessments of whether the  ability is needed to perform the task  or not . The 33 tasks were then grouped into 12 broad categories to address   differences in data availability between  types of  task. For example, “read letters”, “read bills” and “write letters” were  grouped into one category (“literacy – business”), so that this type of task does not weight more in the final score than  tasks types associated with a single PIAAC task (e.g. “dexterity ” or “management”).  For each ability and each  occupation, 12 measures were constructed to reflect the frequency with which workers use the ability in the occupation  to perform tasks under the 12 broad task categories. This was done by taking, within each c ategory of tasks, the sum  of the frequencies of the tasks assigned to the ability divided by the total number of tasks in the category. Finally , the  frequency with which workers use the ability at the two-digit ISCO -08 level and by country was obtained by taking the  sum of these 12 measures.  The methodology, including the definition of the broad categories of tasks, is adapted from  Tolan et  al. (2021 [18]) and Fernández -Macías and Bisello  (2020 [34]).

Therefore, whenever possible,  robustness checks use O*NET scores of “prevalence” and “importance” of abilities within occupations for  the U nited States (as in Felten, Raj and Seamans  (2018 [1])) instead of PIAAC -based measures. These  robustness tests necessarily assume that the importance and prevalence of abilities are the same in other  countries as in the Unit ed States.    The level of exposure to AI in a particular occupation reflects: (i) the progress made by AI in specific  applications and (ii) the extent to which those applications are related to abilities required in that  occupation. Like all task -based meas ures, it is at its core a measure of potential automation  of occupations  by AI, as it indicates which occupations rely most on abilities in which AI has made progress in recent  years. It should capture potential positive productivity effects of AI, as well  as negative substitution effects  caused by (partial) automation of tasks by AI. However, it cannot capture any effects of AI progress on  occupations when these effects do not  rely on worker abilities that are directly related to the capabilities of  AI, su ch as might be the case when AI augments other technologies,  which consequently make progress  in the abilities that a person needs in his/her job (see also Section 2.3). Section 3.1.3  shows AI exposu re  across occupations and builds some intuition on why the indicator identifies some occupations as more  exposed to AI than others.   Figure  2.

The matrix was  built by  an Amazon Mechanical Turk survey of 200 gig workers per AI application, who were  asked whether a given AI a pplication can be used  for a certain ability. The correlation matrix between applications and abilities is then calculated as the share of responden ts who thought that a  given AI application could be used for a given ability.

Occupational exposure to AI   The kind of abilities AI has made the most progress in are disproportionately  used in highly -educated ,  white -collar occupations . As a result, white -collar occupations requiring high levels  of formal education are  among the occupations with the highest exposure to AI:  Science and E ngineering Professionals , but also  Business and Administration Professionals, M anagers ; Chiefs Executive s; and Legal, Social and Cultural  Professionals ( Figure  4). By contrast, occupations  with the lowest exposure  include  occupations with an  emphasis on physical tasks:  Cleaners and Helpers; Agricultural Forestry, Fishery Labourers; F ood  Preparation Assistants and Labourers.30   The occupational intensity of some abilities is poorly estimated due to PIAAC data limitations. In particular,  the 33 PIAAC tasks used in the analysis  include only two non -cognitive tasks, and some of the O*NET  abilities are not related to any of these tasks. Therefore, as a robustness exercise, Figure  A A.1 displays  the level of exposure to AI obtained when using O*NET scores of “prevalence” and “importance” of abilities  within occupation s for the United States (as in Felten, Raj and Seamans  (2018 [1])) instead of the PIAAC based measures. That is, the robustness test assumes that the importance and prevalence of abilities is  the same in other countries as in  the United States. The robustness test shows the same patterns in terms  of AI exposure by occupation, suggesting that it is fine to use the measure linked to PIAAC abilities.   Figure  4.

Cleaners and Helpers, the least exposed occupation according to this measur e, have a low score of  occupational exposure to AI because they rely  less than other workers on cognitive abilities (including  those in which AI has made the most progress), whereas they rely more on physical and psychomotor  abilities (in which AI has made  little progress). Figure  5, Panel A illustrates this by plotting  the extent to  which Cleaners and Helpers use any of the 35 abilities (relative to the average use of that ability across all  occupations) against  AI progress in that  ability. Compared to the average worker, Cleaners and Helpers  rely heavily on physical abilities such as dynamic / static / trunk strength and dexterity, areas in which AI  has made the least progress in recent years. They rely less than other occupations on abilities with the  fastest AI progress, such as information ordering and memorisation. Business Professionals, in contrast,  are heavily exposed to AI because they rely  more than other workers on cognitive abilities, and less on  physical and psychomotor abilities ( Figure  5 Panel B).    As a robustness check, Figure  A A.2 replicates this analysis using O*NET scores of “prevalence” and  “importance” of abilities within occupations instead of PIAAC -based measure s, and it shows the same  patterns.   As abilities are the only link between occupations and progress in AI, the occupational exposure measure  cannot detect any effects of AI that do not work directly through AI capabilities, for example if AI is employed  to make other technologies  more efficient . Consider the example of drivers, an occupation often discussed  as at -risk of being substituted by AI . Drivers receive a below -average score in the AI occupational exposure  measure  (see Figure  4). This is because the driving component of autonomous vehicle technologies relies  on the physical manipulation of objects, which is in the realm of robotics , not o n AI. AI does touch upon  some abilities needed to drive a car – such as th e ability to plan a route or perceive and distinguish objects  at a distance – but the majority of tasks performed when driving a car are physical. AI might well be  essential for driverless cars, but mainly by enabling robotic technology, which possesses th e physical  abilities necessary to drive a vehicle. Thus, this indicator  can be seen as isolating the “pure” effects of AI   (Felten, Raj and Seamans, 2019 [2]).

Even the most exposed cleaners and helpers (in Finland) are only about  half as exposed to AI as  the least  exposed business professionals (in Lithuania) ( Figure  A A.3). That being said, occupations tend to be  slightly more exposed to AI in Northern European countries than in Eastern European ones ( Figure  6).   Figure  6.

A different way of showing that AI exposure varies more across occupations than across countries for a  given occupation is by contrasting the distribution of exposure to AI across occupations in the most  exposed country in the sample (Finland) with that i n the least exposed country (Lithuania, Figure  7).

Differences in exposure to AI between Finland and Lithuania are greater for occupations in the lower half  of the distribution of exposure to AI ( Figure  7). For example, Food Preparation Assistants in Finland are  more than twice as exposed to AI than food preparation assistants in Lithuania, while the score for  Business and Administration Professionals is only 12% higher in Finland th an in Lithuania.   This is because, while occupations across the entire spectrum of exposure to AI rely more on physical than  on cognitive abilities in Lithuania than in Finland, this reliance is more pronounced at the low end of the  exposure spectrum. Figure  8 illustrates this for the least (Cleaners and Helpers) and the most exposed  occupations (Business and Administration Professionals). The top panel displays: (i) the difference in the  intensity of use of each ability by Cleaners  and Helpers between Finland and Lithuania; and (ii) the  progress made by AI in relation to that ability. The bottom panel shows the same for Business and  Administration Professionals.   For both occupations, workers in Lithuania tend to rely more on physica l and psychomotor abilities (which  are little exposed to  AI), and less on cognitive abilities, including cognitive abilities in which AI has made  the most progress.  The differences in the intensity of use of cognitive, physical and psychomotor abilities  between Finland and Lithuania are however greater for Cleaners and Helpers than they are for Business  and Administration Professionals ( Figure  8). As an example of how cleaners may be more exposed to AI  in Finland than in Lithuania, AI navigation tools may help cleaning robots map out their route. They could  therefore substitute for cleaners in supervising cleaning robots, especially in countries where cleaning  robots are more prevalent (e.g. probably in Finland32).

Labour market outcomes   The analysis links occupational exposure to AI to a number of labour market outcomes: employment35,  average hours worked36, the share of part -time workers, and the share of job postings that require AI related  technical skills.  This section presents some descriptive statistics on labour market outcomes for  the period 2012 and 2019. 2012 is chosen as the first year for the period of analysis because it ensures  consistency with the measure of occupational exposur e to AI, for two reasons. First, the measure of  exposure to AI is based on the task composition of occupations in 2012 for most countries.37 Second,  progress in AI applications is measured over the period 2010 -2015. As a result, AI, as proxied by the  occupa tional AI exposure indicator, could affect the labour market starting from 2010 and fully from 2015  onwards. Starting in 2012 provides a long enough observation period, while closely tracking the measure  of recent developments in AI.   3.2.1.  Employment and workin g hours   Overall, in most occupations and on average across the 23 countries, employment grew between 2012  and 2019, a period that coincides with the economic recovery from the global financial crisis. Employment  grew by 10.8% on average across all occupati ons and countries in the sample ( Figure  10). Average  employment growth was negative for only four occupations: Other Clerical Support Workers ( -9.2%),   Skilled Agricultural Workers ( -8.2%),  Handicraft and Printing Workers ( -7.9%), a nd Metal and Machinery  Workers ( -1.7%).   By contrast, average usual weekly hours declined by 0.40% (equivalent to 9 minutes per week38) on  average over the same period ( Figure  11).39 On average across countries, working hours declined  in most  occupations. Occupations with the largest drops in working hours include (but are not limited to)  occupations that most often use part -time employment, such as Sales Workers ( -2.0%); Legal, Social,  Cultural Related Associate Professionals ( -1.8%);  and Agricultural, Forestry, Fishery Labourers ( -1.8%).                                                    35 Employment includes all people engaged in productive activities, whether as employees or self -employed.  Employment data is taken from the Mexican National Survey of Occupation and Employment ( ENOE) , the European  Union Labour Force Survey (EU -LFS) and the US Current Population Survey (US -CPS). The occupation classification  was mapped to ISCO -08 where necessary.  More specifically, the ENOE SINCO  occupation code  was directly mapped  to the ISCO -08 classification . The US -CPS occupation census code variable was first mapped to the SOC 2010  classification.

Job postings that require AI skills   Beyond its effects on job quantity, AI may transform occupations by changing their task composition, as  certain tasks are automated and workers are increasingly  expected to focus on other tasks. This may result  in a hi gher demand for AI -related technical skills as workers interact with these new technologies. However,  it is not necessarily the case that working with AI requires technical AI skills. For example, a translator  using an AI translation tool does not necessar ily need any AI technical skills.   This section looks at the share of job postings that require AI -related technical skills ( AI skills ) by occupation  using job postings data from Burning Glass Technologies40 for the United Kingdom and the United States41.  AI-related technical skills are identified based on the list provided in Acemoglu et  al.

36  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  This section looks at the link between an occupation’s exposure to AI in 2012 and changes in employment,  working hours, and the demand for AI -related technical skills between 2012 and 2019. Exposure to AI  appears to be associated with greater employment growth in occupations where computer use is high, and  larger reductions in hours worked in occupations where computer use is low. So, even though AI may  substitute for workers in certain tasks, it also ap pears to create job opportunities in occupations that require  digital skills. In addition, there is some evidence that greater exposure to AI is associated with greater  increase in demand for AI -related technical skills (such as natural language processing , machine  translation, or image recognition) in occupations where computer use is high. However, as the share of  jobs requiring AI skills remains very small, this increase in jobs requiring AI skills cannot account for the  additional employment growth obse rved in computer -intensive occupations that are exposed to AI.    4.1. Empirical strategy   The analysis links changes in employment levels within  occupations and across countries to AI exposure.43  The regression equation is the following:   Yij=αj+β AIij+γ Xij +uij (1)  where Yij is the percentage change in the number of workers (both dependent employees and self employed)  in occupation i in country j  over the period 2012 -201944; AIij is the index of exposure to AI  for  occupation i  in country j  as measured in 2012; Xij is a vector of controls including exposure to other  technological advances (software and industrial robots), offshorability , exposure to international trade, and  1-digit occupation al ISCO dummies;  αj are c ountry  fixed effect s; and uij is the error term.  The coefficient  of interest β captures the link between exposure to AI and changes in employment. The inclusion of country  fixed effects means that the analysis only exploits within -country variation in AI expo sure to estimate the  parameter of interest. The specifications that include 1 -digit occupational dummies only exploit variation  within broad occupational groups, thereby controlling for any factors that are constant across these groups.   To control for the effect of non -AI technologies, the analysis includes measures of exposure to software  and industrial robots developed by Webb  (2020 [7]).45 Offshoring is proxied by an index of offshorability                                                   43 The analysis is performed at the 2 -digit level of the International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008 (ISCO 08).  44 In a second step, Yij will stand for the percentage chang e in average weekly working hours and the percentage  change in the share of part -time workers.   45 Webb (2020 [7]) uses the overlap between the text of job descriptions provided in the O*NET database and the text  of patents in  the fields of software and industrial robots to construct measures of exposure to each of these  technologies.  To select software patents, Webb uses an algorithm developed by Bessen and Hunt  (2007 [42]) which  requires one of the keywords “software”, “computer”, or “program me” to be present, but none of the keywords “chip”,  “semiconductor”, “bus”, “circuity”, or “circuitry” . To select patents in the field of industrial robots, Webb develops an  algorith m that results in the following search criteria: the title and abstract should include “robot” or “manipulat”, and 4.  Results  
DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12   37  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  developed by Firpo, Fortin and Lem ieux (2011 [23]) and made available by Autor and Dorn  (2013 [24]).46  These three indices are occupation -level task -based measures derived from the O*NET database for the   United States; this analysis uses those measures for all 23 countries, assuming that the cross -occupation  distribution of these indicators is similar across countries.47 Exposure to international trade is proxied by  the share of employment within occupatio ns that is in tradable sectors48. These shares are derived from  the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU -LFS), the Mexican National Survey of Occupation and  Employment (ENOE) , the US Current Population Survey (US -CPS).   4.2. Exposure to AI and employment: a pos itive relationship in occupations  where computer use is high   As discussed in Section  1. , the effect of exposure to AI on employment is theoretically ambiguous. On the  one hand, employment may fall as tasks are automated (substi tution effect). On the other hand, productivity  gains may increase labour demand (productivity effect) (Bessen, 2019 [25]; Acemoglu and Restr epo,  2019 [26]; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019 [27]; Lane and Saint -Martin, 2021 [6]).49 The labour market impact  of  AI on a given occupation is  likely  to depend on the task composition  of that occupation – the prevalence  of high-value added tasks  that AI canno t automate  (e.g. tasks that require creativity or social intelligence)   or the extent to which the occupation already uses other digital technologies  (since AI applications are  often similar to software in their use, workers with digital skills may find it easier to use AI effectively (Felten,  Raj and Seamans, 2019 [2])). Therefore, the following analysis will not only look at the entire sample of  occupation -country cells , but will also split the sample according to what people do in these occupations  and countries.   While employment grew faster in occupations more exposed to AI, this relationship is not robust. There is  stronger evidence that AI exposure is positively related to employment growth in occupations where                                                   the patent should not fall within the categories: “medical or veterinary science; hygiene” or “physical or chemical  processes or apparatus in  general”.   46 Autor and Dorn  (2013 [24]) measure the potential offshoring of job tasks using the average between the two variables  “Face -to-Face Contact” and “On -Site Job” that Firpo, Fortin and Lemie ux (2011 [23]) derive from the O*NET database  (they reverse the sign to measure offshorability instead of non -offshorability). This measure captures the extent to  which an occupation requires direct interpersonal interaction or proximity to a specific work location.  Firpo, Fortin and  Lemieux  (2011 [23]) define “face -to-face contact” as the average value between the O*NET variables “face -to-face  discussions”, “establishing and maintaining interper sonal relationships”, “assisting and caring for others”, “performing  for or working directly with the public”, and “coaching and developing others”. They define “on -site job” as the average  between the O*NET variables “inspecting equipment, structures, or material”, “handling and moving objects”,  “operating vehicles, mechanized devices, or equipment”, and the mean of “repairing and maintaining mechanical  equipment” and “repairing and maintaining electronic equipment”.   47 All three indices are available by oc cupation based on U.S. Census occupation code s. They were  first mapped to  the SOC 2010 6-digits classification  and then  to the ISCO -08 4-digit classification.  They were finally aggregated at the  2-digit level using average scores weighted by the number of full-time equivalent employees in each occupation in the  United -States, as provided by Webb (2020 [7]) and based on American Community Survey 2010 data.   48 The tradable sectors considered are agriculture, industry,  and f inanci al and insurance activities .   49 Partial worker substitution in an occupation may increase worker productivity and employment in the same  occupation, but also in other occupations and sectors  (Autor and S alomons, 2018 [33]). These AI -induced productivity  effects are relevant to the present cross -occupation analysis to the extent that they predominantly affect the same  occupation where AI substitutes for workers. For example, although AI translation algori thms may substitute for part  of the work of translators, they may increase the demand for translators by significantly reducing translation costs.  
38  DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(20 21)12  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE NCE AND EMPLOYMENT   Unclassified  computer use50 is high.  Table  2 displays t he results of regression equation (1) without controls. When  looking at the entire sample, the coefficient on AI exposure is both positive and statistically significant  (Column 1), but this result is only weakly robust51. When the sample is split by level of computer use (low,  medium, high), the coefficient on AI exposure remains positive and statistically significant  only for the  subsample where computer use  is high (Column s 2-4). It remains so after succes sive in clusion of controls  for international trade (i.e. shares of workers in tradable sectors), offshorability, exposure to other  technological advances (software and industrial robots) and 1 -digit occupational dummies ( Table  3).52 By  contrast, t he average wage level53 of the occupation or the prevalence of creative or social tasks54 matter  little in the link between exposure to AI and employment growth ( Table  A A.1).55 In occupations where  computer use is high , a one standard deviation increase in AI exposure is associated with 5.7 percentage  points higher employment growth ( Table  2 Column 4).56   As an additional robustness check, Table  A A.2 in the Appendix repl icates the analysis in Table  2 using  the score of exposure to AI obtained when using O*NET scores of “prevalence” and “importance” of abilities  within occupations instead of PIAAC -based measures. The results remain unchanged. Table  A A.3                                                   50 The level of computer use  within an occupation is proxied by the share of workers reporting the use of a co mputer  at work in that occupation, calculated for each of the 23 countries in the sample. It is based on individuals ’ answers to  the question “Do you use a computer in your job?”, taken from the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC).  Occupation -country  cells are then classified into three categories of computer use (low, medium and high), where the terciles are calculated  based on the full sample of occupation -country cells. Data are from 2012, with the exception of Hungary (2017),  Lithuania (2014) and Mexico (201 7).   51 The coefficient is no longer statistically significant as soon as any of the controls described in Section 4.1 are  included (with the exception of offshorability). These results are not displayed but are available on requ est.  52 Table  2 and Table  3 correspond to unweighted regressions, but the results hold when each observation is weighted  by the inverse of the number of country observations  in the subsample considered, so t hat each country has the same  weight. These results are not displayed but are available on request.   53 The classification used is the country -invariant classification developed by Goos, Manning and Salomons  (2014 [28]),  which classifies occupations based on their average wage  relying on European C ommunity Household Panel (ECHP)  data. For example, occupations with an average wage in the middle of the occupation -wage distribution would be  classified in t he middle with respect to this classification. Low -skill occupations include the ISCO -08 1-digit occupation  groups: Services and Sales Workers; and Elementary Occupations. Middle -skill occupations include the groups:  Clerical Support Workers; Skilled Agric ultural, Forestry and Fishery Workers; Craft and Related Trades Workers; and  Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers. High -skill occupations include: Managers; Professionals, and  Technicians; and Associate Professionals.   54 The prevalence of creative and  social tasks is derived from PIAAC data. PIAAC data include the frequency with  which a number of tasks are performed at the individual level. Respondents’ self -assessment are based on a 5 -point  scale ranging from “Never” to “Every day”. This information i s used to measure the average frequency with which  workers in each occupation perform creative or social tasks, and this is done separately for each country. In line with  Nedelkoska and Quintini  (2018 [32]), creative  tasks include: problem solving - simple problems, and problem solving -  complex problems; and social tasks include: teaching, advising, planning for others, communicating, negotiating,  influencing, and selling. For each measure, occupation -country cells a re then classified into three categories  depending on the average frequency with which these tasks are performed (low, medium and high). These three  categories are calculated by applying terciles across the full sample of occupation -country cells.  Data are  from 2012,  with the exception of Hungary (2017), Lithuania (2014) and Mexico (2017).   55 Table  A A.1 in Appendix shows the results obtained when replicating the analysis  on the subsamples obtained by  splitting the overall sample by average wage level, prevalence of creative tasks, or prevalence of social tasks. All  coefficients  on exposure to AI  remain positive, but are weakly statistically significant and of lower magnitude than those  obtained on the subsample of occupations where c omputer use is high ( Table  3).  56 The standard deviation of exposure to AI is 0.067 among high computer use occupations. Multiplying this by the  coefficient in Column 4 gives 0.067* 85.73 = 5.74.

(2021 [18]) indicator is positive but not statistically significant .  This could be due to the fact that the Tolan et  al. (2021 [18]) indicator reflects different aspects of AI  advances, as it focuses more on cognitive abilities and is based on research intensity rather than on  measures of progress in AI applications . Both sets of results sugges t a negative relationship between  employment growth and exposure to AI among occupations where computer use is low, consistent with  the main findings of this paper.

Source: Authors’ calculations using data from ENOE, EU -LFS, US -CPS, PIAAC, Autor and Dorn  (2013 [24]), Felten, Raj and Seamans (2019 [2])  and Webb  (2020 [7]).  The examples of the United Kingdom and the United States illustrate these findings clearly.58 Figure  13  shows the percenta ge change in employment from 2012 to 2019 for each occupation against that  occupation’s exposure to AI in 2012, both in the United Kingdom (Panel A) and the United States (Panel  B). Occupations are classified according to their level of computer use. The r elationship between exposure  to AI and employment growth within computer use groups is generally positive, but the correlation is  stronger in occupations where computer use is high. For occupations with high computer use, t he most  exposed  occupations  tend to have experienced higher employment growth between 2012 and 2019 :  Business Professionals; Legal, Social and Cultural Professionals; M anagers ; and S cience & Engineering  Professionals.  AI applications relevant to these occupations include: identifying inve stment opportunities,  optimising production in manufacturing plants, identifying problems on assembly lines, analysing and  filtering recorded job interviews, and translation. In  contrast , high computer -use occupations with  low or  negative employment growth  were occupations with relatively low exposure to AI, such as clerical workers  and teaching professionals.     While further research is needed  to test the causal nature of these patterns and to identify the exact  mechanism behind them , it is possible that a high level  of digital skills (as proxied by computer use)  indicates a greater ability of workers to adapt to and use new technologies at work and, hence, to reap the                                                   58 Although statistically significant on aggregate, the relationships between emplo yment growth and exposure to AI  suggested by Table  2  are not visible for some countries.

Exposure to  AI and working time: a negative relationship among occupations  where  computer use  is low   This subsection ex tends the analysis by shifting the focus from the number of working individuals  (extensive margin of employment) to how much these individuals work (intensive margin).    In general, the higher the level of exposure to AI in an occupation, the greater the d rop in average hours  worked over the period 2012 -2019; and this relationship is particularly marked in occupations where  computer use is low. Column (1) of Table  4 presents the results of regression equation (1) using the  percentag e change in average usual weekly working hours as the variable of interest. The statistically  significant and negative coefficient on exposure to AI highlights a negative relationship across the entire  sample. Splitting the sample by computer use category shows that this relationship is stronger among  occupations with lower computer use (Column 2 -4). The size of the coefficients in Column 2 indicates that,  within countries and across occupations with low computer use, a one standard deviation increase in  exposure to AI is associated with a 0.60 percentage point greater drop in usual weekly working hours60  (equivalent to 13 minutes per week).61 Columns 1 -4 of Table  5 show that the result is robust to the  successive in clusion of controls  for international trade, offshorability, and exposure to other technologies.  However, the coefficient on exposure to AI loses statistical significance when controlling for 1 digit  occupational dummies ( Table  5 Column 5).62  The rela tionship between exposure to AI and the drop in average hours worked was driven by part -time  employment.63 Columns 5 to 8 of Table  4 replicate  the analysis  in Columns 1 to 4  using the change in the  occupation -level share of part-time workers  as the variable of interest. The results are consistent with those  in columns 2 to 4: the coefficient on exposure to AI is positive and statistically significant only for the  subsample of occupations where computer use is low (Columns 6 -8). The c oefficient remains statistically  significant and positive when controlling for international trade and offshorability, but loses statistical  significance when controlling for exposure to other technological advances and 1 -digit occupational  dummies ( Table  5 columns 6 -10).64 The results hold when replacing the share of part -time workers with  the share of involuntary part -time workers65 (Table  A A.7), suggesting that the additional decline in working  hours among  low computer use occupations that are exposed to AI is not a voluntary choice by workers.                                                    60 The standard deviation of exposure to AI is 0.125 among low computer use occupations.  Multiplying this by the  coefficient in Column 2 gives 0.125*( -4.823 ) = -0.60.   61 Estimated at the average working hours among low computer use occupations (37.2 hours).   62 Table  4 and Table  5 correspond to unweighted regressions, but most of the results hold when each observation is  weighted by the i nverse of the number of country observations in the subsample considered, so that each country has  the same weight. These results are not displayed but are available on request.   63 Part-time workers are defined as workers usually working 30 hours or less pe r week in their main job.   64 As an additional robustness exercise, Table  A A.4 in the Appendix replicates the analysis using the score of  exposure to AI obtained when using O*NET scores of “prevalence” and “importance” of abilities within occupations  instead of PIAAC -based measures. The results remain qualitatively unchanged, but the coefficients on exposure to AI  are no longer statistically significant on the subsample of occupations where computer use is low, when using working  hours as the variable of interest. Table  A A.5 and Table  A A.6 replicate the analysis using the alternative indicators of  exposure to AI constructed by Webb  (2020 [7]) and Tolan et al. (2021 [18]). When using the Webb  (2020 [7]) indicator, the  results hold on the entire sample but are not robust on the subsample of occupations where computer us e is low.  Using the Tolan et  al. (2021 [18]) indicator, the results by subgroups hold qualitatively but the coefficients are not  statistically significant.   65 Involuntary part -time workers are defined  as part -time workers (i.e. workers working 30 hours or less per week) who  report either that they could not find a full -time job or that they would like to work more hours .

Mexico is excluded from the ana lysis of working time due to data availability.   Source: Authors’ calculations using data from EU -LFS, US -CPS, PIAAC, Autor and Dorn  (2013 [24]), Felten, Ra j and Seamans (2019 [2]) and  Webb  (2020 [7]).  The examples of Germany and Spain provide a good illustration of these results.66 Figure  14 shows the  percentage change in a verage usual weekly working hours from 2012 to 2019 for each occupation against  that occupation’s exposure to AI, both in Germany (Panel A) and in Spain (Panel B). As before, occupations  are classified according to their degree of computer use (low, medium , high). In both countries, there is a  clear negative relationship between exposure to AI and the change in working hours among occupations  where computer use is low. In particular, within the low computer use category, most occupations with  negative growt h in working hours are relatively exposed to AI. These occupations include: Drivers and  Mobile Plant O perators , Personal Service Workers, and S killed A gricul tural Workers. AI applications  relevant to these occupations include  route optimisation for drivers , personalised chatbots and demand  forecasting in the tourism industry67, or the use of  computer vision in the agricultural sector to identify  plants that need special attention. By contrast, low computer use occupations with the strongest growth in  working  hours are generally less exposed to AI. This is for example the case for Labourers (which includes  labourers in transport and storage, manufacturing, or mining and construction).   Again, while further research is required, a lack of digital skills may mean  that workers are not able to  interact efficiently with AI and thus cannot reap all potential benefits of the technology. The substitution  effect of AI in those occupations therefore appears to outweigh the productivity effect, resulting in reduced  working  hours.  However, these results remain suggestive, as they are weakly robust to the inclusion of the  full set of controls and the use of alternative indicators of exposure to AI.                                                    66 Although statistically significant on aggregate, the relationships between the p ercentage change in average usual  weekly working hours and exposure to AI suggested by Table  4  are not visible for some countries.   67 For example, personalised chatbots can partially substitute for travel attendants . Demand forecas ting algorithms  may facilitate the operation of hotels, including the work of housekeeping supervisors. Travel Attendants and  Housekeeping Supervisors both fall into the Personal Service Workers category.

Exposure to AI and demand for AI -related technical  skills: a weak but  positive relationship among occupations where  computer use  is high   Beyond its effects on employment, AI may also transform occupations as workers are increasingly  expected to interact with the technology. This may result in a higher demand for AI -related technical skills  in affected occupations, although it is not necessarily the case that working with AI re quires technical AI  skills.   Indeed, exposure to AI is positively associated with the growth in the demand for AI technical skills,  especially in occupations where computer use is high. Figure  15 shows  the correlation  between the gr owth  in the share of job posting s that require AI skills  from 2012 to 2019 within occupations  and occupation level exposure to AI  for the United Kingdom (Panel A) and the United States (Panel B), the only countries  in the sample with BGT time series availa ble. Occupations are again classified according to their computer  use. There is a positive correlation between the growth in the share of job postings requiring AI skills and  the AI exposure measure, particularly  among occupations where computer use is hig h. The most exposed  of these occupations (Science and Engineering Professionals; Managers; Chief Executives; Business and  Administration P rofessionals; Legal, Social, C ultural pro fessionals) are also experiencing the largest  increases in job postings requi ring AI skills.    However,  the increase in jobs requiring AI skills cannot account for the additional employment growth  observed in computer -intensive occupations that are exposed to AI (despite the similarities between the  patterns displayed in Figure  13 and Figure  15). As highlighted by the different scales in those two charts,  the order of magnitude of the correlation between exposure to AI and the percentage change in  employment ( Figure  13) is more than ten times that of the correlation between exposure to AI and the  percentage point change in the share of job postings requiring AI skills ( Figure  15).68 This is because job  postings requiring AI skills remai n a very small share of overall job postings. In 2019, on average across  the 36 occupations analysed, job posting s that require AI skills  accounted for only 0.14% of overall postings  in the United Kingdom and 0.24% in the United States. By contrast, across  the same 36 occupations,  employment grew by 8.82% on average in the United States and 11.15% in the United Kingdom between  2012 and 2019.                                                    68 The results of the regression equation (1) on the  subsample (of only 26 observations) of high computer use  occupations in the United Kingdom and the United States give a coefficient on exposure to AI equal to 151.4 when  using percentage employment growth as the variable of interest, which is about forty times greater than the 4.1  obtained when using percentage point change in the share of job posting s that require AI skills  as the variable of  interest.
