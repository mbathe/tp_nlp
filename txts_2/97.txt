DIGITAL ETHICS A GUIDE FOR PROFESSIONALS OF THE DIGITAL AGE OCTOBER 2018 
  
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE?   AI technology is a fast -growing field, and people are becoming very anxious  about the ethical issues raised by the g rowth in digital uses. However, this area  is about much more than just the dilemmas that might hypothetically relate to,  for example, a driverless car. Tool bias, environmental impacts and the ethical  issues solution designers have to address are just some of the points that merit  discussion from an ethical standpoint.     The public authorities have grappled with the issue of ethics and digital  technology, including the proposal, made in the Villani report, and in the r eport  from CERNA (the Research Ethics Bo ard of Allistene, the Digital Sciences and  Technologies Alliance), to set up a national digital ethics council modelled on  the existing consultative ethics committee for life sciences and healthcare.     While praising this approach, Cigref and Syntec Numériq ue, as  representatives of the main players in digital society, wanted to provide an  initial, operational take on the subject. The aim of this guide is to describe the  topics that are being –  or should be – considered by people working with digital  technology in their current practice, and to provide some pragmatic answers  to the questions they have.     This guide is an educational tool for digital professionals, and a first step on  the way to a common vis ion of ethics we can all share, a key element in  buildi ng trust in the digital economy. This is a tool everyone can use!

ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 3  BACKGRO UND  Digital technology is bringing about a radical change in business, a paradigm  shift that has an impact on organisational practices, business models,  management methods and human relationships. The nature of work is  changing, and the boundaries of business are shifting . This transformation is  giving rise to new opportunities for the new digital economy,  but is also raising  new and related ethical issues. There has never been so much talk about the  issues around data protection, respect for privacy, neutrality, the transparency  of algorithms and the right to be forgotten. Every business stakeholder must  therefor e be urged to grip the potential opportunities linked to new digital tools  and uses, and at the same time the ways in which they might be misused. But  how can we come to terms practically with this subject in business, and what  ethical issues need to be addressed with departments  and/or operations  teams?    Cigref and Syntec Numérique, as representatives of the main players in digital  society, believe that a common and shared vision of digital ethics needs to be  developed as a matter of urgency, in order to build, together, the soli d basis  needed for trust going forward.     That is why our two organisations were keen to develop a practical frame of  reference that companies and their partners can all use, in order to educate  teams and managers about the ethical challenges of digital tec hnology, and  give them the tools to deal with them.  
4 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE   HOW SHOULD THIS GUIDE BE USED?   The “ Digital Ethics ” guide from Cigref and Syntec Numérique is intended to  categorise the ethical issues linked to digital technology, from the point of view  of both the us er (Cigref) and the designer of digital solutions and/or services  (Syntec Numérique). It offers food for thought (which questions might  companies ask themselves about the ethics of digital technology?) and  sugge sts avenues to pursue.     This guide is not exhaustive. It is designed to be generalist and open to any  contributions. Nor is it intended to restate a company’s regulatory duties; the  regulations state precisely what is and is not allowed, and the applicable   sanctions. Companies are obliged to comply, and this has nothing to do with  ethics. However, there might be ethical issues around how they achieve  compliance.     This guide does however address a number of key points in the GDPR, the  regulation which writes  into law a range of concepts that had previously been  discussed from an ethical standpoint, such as the notion of privacy by design.     The guide is made of two sections:   • The first section presents the questions to ask ones elf, and then the  resources and measures to implement in response.   • The second section identifies existing initiatives relating to the ethics  of  digital technology in business (with a focus on France).     ETHICS: NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH COMPLIANCE   Ethics and compliance should be considered as separate domains.  Compliance is all about operating in accordance with a standard or a law –   something external which has authority. It is therefore everyone’s  responsi bility to abide by the law or face sanctions. Ethics, on the other hand,  is a personal or collective approach (at company level, f or example) which  entails setting guidelines for oneself. This approach is based on values or  principles that can guide one's actions. Ethics is an act of empowerment (and  not only responsibility), engagement and integrity.  
ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 7  That is why this guide is not about GDPR compliance, because ethics begins  where regulation ends. As the Villani report says: “Where stan dards are nonexistent, silent or insufficient, the developer has an increased moral responsibility.”  (p.147 of the report)     COMPARATIVE TABLE OF ETH ICS  AND COMPLIANCE   (Source: Flora Fischer –  Cigref)   ETHICS  COMPLIANCE   • Provides a basis for making our  own decisions about courses of  action based on the values  and/or principles we hold dear   • Entails respecting  standards/laws/principl es issued by  one or more external bodies     • Addresses value dilemmas and  conflicts specific to each context,  on a case- by-case basis   • Forms part of a universal  framework  (at the  national/international level)   • Draws on ideas relating to  values, deliberation and  recommendations   • Draws on notions of standards and  obligations       Provides a basis for choosing how  best to consider an issue and then act  on a case- by-case basis, and for  considering different and conflicting  values/principles   Provides a basis for action in accordan ce  with the law or any other measures having  a legal and moral dimension (contract,  specificatio ns, etc.)               
8 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE   DIGITAL ETHICS , AN APPLIED ETHICS   There are various branches of ethics, all derived from moral philosophy, including  normative ethics, meta -ethics, and applied ethics. It is the latter that inter ests us  here. It can be argued that digital technology opens up a new sphere of action,  which is not neutral and must therefore implement a number of ethical principles.  Some debates may be wholly new , because each technology raises its own issues.  The ethics of digital technology is therefore first and foremost an applied ethics  which must, depending on the context and the technologies in place, adapt or  reinvent itself.         • NORMATIVE ETHICS encompas ses various conceptions of what we might call  ethical behaviour. It is made up of three major schools of thought:   - Virtue ethics : describes the moral character of an action according to the  accompanying virtue. People talk of courageous, just and generous a cts, for  example.  In this conception, it is the courses of action and moral attributes of the  person that are most important.   - Consequentalism : focuses on the effects of actions, and their short - and longterm positive or negative consequences. Utilitariani sm, which  is also regarded as  a branch of consequentalism, starts from the premise that we should aim for  outcomes that maximise the life chances and well -being of the greatest number of  people.   - Deontology : examines whether an action complies with a duty ( often a  professional duty), or an established norm. It tends to translate into codes specific  to a profession. It builds into a framework intended to establish behavioural  principles within a  group .    • META -ETHICS, meanwhile, examines the grounds for morals.  This con stantly feeds  into normative ethics by discussing afresh the proposed principles, the criteria for the  ethical evaluation of an action, etc.     • APPLIED ETHICS puts normative ethics into practice,  by comparing a concrete  situation with principles der ived from  various schools of normative ethics. Ethical  dilemmas are always resolved using applied ethics.  THE MAIN BRANCHES OF ETHICS   
ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 9  Applied ethics demands a form of vigilance on the part of the person  concerned, who may be subject to contradictory demands, in an urgent context  specific to the business environment. If an ethical dilemma is raised, the  person may follow this path, for ex ample:   TAKE A STEP BACK   This entails putting some distance between you and your everyday reality in  order to better evaluate and gain perspective on various dimensions (social,  environmental, divergent interests, etc.) before acting in accordance with a  purely economic rationale. It also means having an ability to forecast possible  future events, and more modestly the medium - and long -term consequences   of our present actions.   For example, developer s of artificial intelligence algorithms may draw on tools  enabling them to limit the biases of their solutions by design because they  haave studied, in advance, the risks of using their solution.   CHOOSE THE “B EST” POSSIBLE ETHICS   There are always multiple possible choices when thinking ethically. That is why  people often talk about “ethical dilemmas”. Ethical choices often put to the test  the various ethical theories (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics , etc.),  which can contradict each other, depending on the context. In ethics, there is  never an absolute answer, but more likely “best” possible choices in different  situations.   For example, during their career developer s may encounter a conflict between  their duty-based ethics and their personal ethics (or virtue ethics).   ARBITRATE WITH A THIRD PARTY IF  NECESSARY   Arbitration means resolving an ethical dilemma by calling on an external third  party because the interests of the parties concerned are too subs tantial to  settle a situation fairly. This third party may be a code (e.g. an ethical charter),  a mor al entity (e.g. an ethics committee or an ethics department), or a legal  entity (e.g. a contract).   For example, a robotics company may reserve the right to  forbid its customers  from reprogramming its robots, if the reprogramming does not comply with its  usage policy, which in this case acts as a third party.  
10 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE   3 MAIN CATEGORIES FOR AN ETHICS  APPLIED TO DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY   The ethics of digital technology can be segmented into three separate  categories.   1 ETHICS BY DESIGN   This ethics fo cuses on the design phase of digital tools. It directly concerns  technology in all its technical complexity and the know -how of engineers,  programmers, etc. This ethics theref ore touches in particular on the deontology  (duty -based ethics) of digital creators of all kinds (developers, digital  designers, project managers, etc.). Indeed, they have an ethical responsibility  from the design stage onwards, insofar as data or algorithms may or may not  reproduce human biases, reveal new discriminations (or reproduc e them on a  larger scale), give rise to injustices, etc.   2 ETHICS OF USE   This ethics aims to examine how the customers and employees as well as the  managers and partners of a company use digital technology. This entails  conducting an ethical evaluation of how people use the technological  resources at their disposal.   3 SOCIETAL ETHICS   This ethics examines, at a macroscopic level, the impacts of  digital technology  on soci ety. It thus deals with the acceptability of digital innovations and  solutions, “attention econom ics”, the environmental and energy footprints of  digital tools , and social inclusion.       These three categories of ethics are of course interconnected, but they  need  to be separated in order to better define the issues at stake, which are often  located on very different scales.  
ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 11  SOME DIGITAL -SPECIFIC ETHICAL   ISSUES   In this section we will highlight several  digita l-specific ethical issues, some of  which have emerg ed recently or are still unclear. M ore conventional and better known issues such as cross- referencing data, and transparency with  customers, are not discussed below but are mentioned quite frequently in th e  guide.   THE DESIGN OF ATTENTION   While grabbing a c ustomer’s attention and trying to keep it for as long as  possible is a well -known marketing strategy  that can easily be spotted, it is  worth noting that with digital tools this type of strategy is less per ceptible,  because the attention -grabbing techniques  are more subtle, and may also  harness apparently playful  mechanisms. The term “dark patterns” is used to  describe some interface design tricks intended to trick the user.   THE DUTY -BASED ETHICS OF DEVELOPE RS, SUPPLIERS AND  INTEGRATORS OF DIGITAL SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES   Following breakthroughs and major progress in data science and in AI  algorithms capable of learning, there is a growing awareness of the ethical  responsibility of the developers of digital sol utions. Their profession is  particularly liable to be asked these questions, because they are the ones who  oversee machine learning, using databases that may contain biases (see  “Algorithmic ethics and AI” below), which demands an aptitude for impartiality   and the default consideration of these issues at t he earliest possible stage.  Suppliers and integrators have a high de facto level of responsibility for the  way in which digital solutions or services are designed and put together.   ALGORITHMIC ETHICS AND A RTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE   AI raises specific ethical i ssues. Machine learning algorithms are  mushrooming in numerous sectors. These algorithms, which learn from  multiple examples, lack transparency and traceability tools that can explain  their results. Hence the expression “black box”, which is often used to  characterise the opacity of some systems.  
12 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE    For algorithms to be explainable, we need to take account of multiple factors:   Database selection : some databases used as learning resources for  algorithms may spread cognitive biases. Some databases may, for exam ple,  in a particular domain, contain a cultural and historic bias when it comes to  gender representativeness. It seems important to be able to explain the  content of the data selected and used by learning algorithms in order to ensure  their neutrality.   Supervised learning : there is a risk that injustices or discrimination may be  reproduced in machine learning. That is why the supervision of machine  learning is particularly important. Some developers put in place an evaluation  process dedicated specifically to the issue of neutrality in learning, and set  aside pre- live release test phases.   Social acceptability : some algorithmic systems have a non- negligible socia l  impact; they might, for example, have a huge influence on political behaviour  by means of “filter bubbles”.   THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY FOOTPRINT OF THE  DIGITAL  SECTOR   Digital technology is generating a large rise in energy consumption, through  both the  production and the use of devices. The digitalisation of the world  (leading to an increase in dat a flows, data processing, data storage, etc.) is  having serious negative effects on the planet (climate change, extraction of  scarce metals, health impacts, etc.). Yet there is still a low level of awareness  of the environmental and energy footprint of dig ital technology.
